0,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,the finish comes off super easily and the clasp is super hard to fasten the first time then falls out after that,23,0
1,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,my first time wearing a clicker in my septum and i absolutely love this clicker fit my petite nose perfectly i would purchase again,24,1
2,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,did not show up in 2 days like they were supposed to with prime shipping got them about a week later and the bar is super loose and really hard to click into the hole i bought these for my diath peircing and they are not going to work i think if i was using them for a septum identification have trouble getting them in that too and in the picture they look black but are in fact a dark silver,80,2
3,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i have a little trouble getting clicker closed but do love the over all look it does hang low but that is what i like about it,27,3
4,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,it was really nice for the first couple of weeks sadly the clasp gave up too soon and would not stay closed enjoyed it while it lasted,26,4
5,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,the clasp broke after a few uses kind of a bummer since it looked great when it worked,18,5
6,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,i love this nose ring it fits really snugly and it is super sturdy some people mentioned having issues getting it off it can be a little difficult and i just used hemostats or roach clips as some call them to grip the bar and pull it out so that was no issue for me but i much prefer the piece being sturdy instead of falling out everytime i move my head i get so many compliments on this ring i would repuchase in a heartbeat,85,6
7,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,this is the first septum ring I have ever bought that did not turn green in my nose within a week so that is a only issue is that the hinge is really loose so you have to be really really careful while blowing / rubbing your nose and it makes it kind of difficult to put it in,54,7
8,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,the clasp will not close and if you get it to close it pops open immediately,15,8
9,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,pros feels light on the face looks good easy to put in con all the reviews about the clicker are true it is sh t broken by the next day after only replacing it maybe twice,34,9
10,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,a little bigger then i usually like but i also have a tiny nose,14,10
11,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,i bought this clicker specifically to wear to a wedding in india because it is way bigger / more showy than i normally wear it was absolutely perfect for the occasion and i liked it so much that i ended up wearing it the entire time during my three week trip it held up pretty well despite me constantly playing with it and having to take it out a couple times for facials by the time my trip was over i noticed that the locking mechanism was not working as well and that i could not play with or tug on the nose ring without it coming unclasped still the clicker cost less than my average daily coffee purchases so I had say it is still a good value for the price,125,11
12,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,avoidis not surgical or stainless steel gold looks really fake hinge is wobbly and clasp does not stay shut if you have a wide septum the bad will not fit your nose comfortably returning for refund,37,12
13,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,looks as expected but where it is supposed to click does not do so appropriately so it comes undone often,18,13
14,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,beautiful tribal swirl septum clicker perfect and works well,9,14
15,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,it is so cute and snug in my nose it does not seem too sturdy but honestly you get what you pay for I am using this for one event one night so as long as it holds out for that evening I am golden,41,15
16,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,nice look tight fighting at the nose but comfortable,9,16
17,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,it was great the first time i wore it now it will not click into place it actually got stuck in my nose for a few minutes because it closed to the side of where it is actually supposed to it looks like the hinge wore out already,46,17
18,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i bought this for my best friend for christmas she loves it it fits her face perfectly and her best friend knows her so well haha i would recommend it,30,18
19,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,since getting it it will not clasp or hold at all even when it is out in will not clasp very cheaply made you get what you pay for i guess but still not worth it,33,19
20,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,piece is tiny it sits right up against my nose making it stick out a bit i would have preferred it hang like others photos clasp is firm which is always nice keeps it from coming loose but the hinge is loose it just flops all over the place making it hard to get in it sure is pretty although,60,20
21,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,the nose ring would not come out of my nose,10,21
22,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,looks better in the picture almost looks like a plastic piece of jewelry you would get out of a quarter machine in person also it is way to small i almost could not even get it to click shut,37,22
23,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,when thearrived it was not theshown it is in fact much lighter almost silver the clicker is very difficult and moves in other directions not just up and down into the slot still a beautiful septum ring however happy with much purchase overall but the picture is misleading,52,23
24,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,much too small and it is not as dark as the picture it looks silver ti me,17,24
25,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,was not black first of all it was more of a gun metal grey which is fine except that it was not shown that way the coating came off in less than a week and started to irritate my skin so i have already had to get rid of it,48,25
26,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,cute lightweight trendy easy to insert and remove but hangs a bit loose in the septum making it feel like you have a runny nose,25,26
27,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,this was great wore it for about two months before the clasp stopped holding closed it is very very large although the bottom rested on my lip not exactly comfortable,29,27
28,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,flat top septums are no good at least for me i can not wear them as long as i can wear a fully rounded clicker worth the price but do not expect to be able to wear it constantly,37,28
29,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,this is one of the first clickers i have bought i have heard some clickers are hard to close and particularly hard to open but this one was really easy to open the hinge is a little loose but can easily be handled i would buy a similar one from the same manufacture and would recommend to people 10/10,59,29
30,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,the clicker part of it is not stiff making it hard to put in your nose the actual ring of it i found too small for my nose as well was 3 weeks late for my shipping it is cute although,39,30
31,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,very cute it is not really black more of a gun metal grey,12,31
32,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,after wearing this for awhile thewears off,9,32
33,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,the quality is amazing but is a lot bigger than i thought it would be a lot i was so unhappy with it that i gave it to my sister it just was not suited for me personally but it is a beautiful and high quality piece of body jewelry,48,33
34,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,straight hinges for septum huuurrttt so much can not keep it in longer than 5 minutes need something curved it is very pretty although wish it did not hurt so much,29,34
35,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,disaster had a bad allergic reaction it is being sent back just got it friday thumbs down I am allergic to nickel so i have to find surgical steel that is 100 nickel free oh and it turned green keep in mind i got it friday april 8th and started noticing problems sunday the 10th took it out on the 11th sent back on the 12th,63,35
36,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,i love it it was super super hard to get in the first time because the bar is very loose but once i finally got it in it fit perfectly and snapped in fine it is hard to get out but not too bad after opening and closing a few times the clicker became loose but all you have to do is push the circle part closer together,67,36
37,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,did not fit clasp too hard to open and close waste of money,13,37
38,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,fits fine but it is not black more of a dark grey,11,38
39,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,pretty decent piece of jewelry girlfriend uses it and she loves it i recommend it for fancy occasions as it is not really an everyday kind of ring,27,39
40,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,had to send it back once i got it in it would not stay closed too bad it would have been really pretty,21,40
41,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,I am not sure if this was delivered to the right house i have not seen a package i wanted this fir my daughters birthday,23,41
42,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,my package arrived today and i immediately put it in it was a bit challenging to get open but it only took a few minutes to get in and the clasp closed even with my long nails i do not intend to take it out very often so hopefully i will not have any issues with the clasp wearing out it is bigger than I am used to so it does feel a little huge at first however i really like the look over all,82,42
43,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i really like it it came earlier than expected and it is really cute the only thing i have to complain about is that it is a bit large but other than that it is great and i would recommend it,39,43
44,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,cute at first sight lasted for 2 days after i took it out and put it back in the clicker did not work any longer the septum ring fell right out,30,44

47,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,this came in looking gigantic on my face it is way to big and very unflattering,16,47
48,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,i was not pleased at all the inside diameter is to small to fit comfortably it is also to clunky to look pretty once in,24,48

50,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,it is nice but it does not really fit my face sadly still recommend tho,13,50
51,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,if you but these cost it with kamar varinsh it is a glossed used on costume jewelry art painting and more it works great let dry for 2 - 5 hours i say 2 - 4 at best you should never purchase costume jewelry and not expect it to turn or cheap you have to protect it,52,51
52,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,unfortunately the bar is not long enough to fit my septum very pretty but will not work for me,18,52
53,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,cheap as pic but teeeeeeerrrrrriiiiibbbbbbbbbbllllllleeeee quality the snap does not stay,10,53
54,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,i do not usually have an issue with any of the products i buy on amazon but my god how disappointed i was with this piercing first it is super cheap made and flimsy second it is nearly impossible to put in and lastly i ordered it in black and received a silver one,52,54
55,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,it is a pretty septum clicker but unfortunately for me it is too big and looks silly my septum piercing is low so that could be why it is so big on my face hope this review helps,36,55
56,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,does not look like thepictured what so ever it is not a terrible design but it is absolutely not the sameas pictured the hole is also very small so it develops a lot of crusties,37,56
57,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,fits nice and snug it is a bit abnoxious perhaps that is why i love it so much the filigree reached down to the top of my lips the clicker is very easy to put in and take out,37,57
58,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,latch can be a little janky but it looks so cute,11,58
59,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,total waste of money i just got it in today and put it in it went in fine but then it got stuck and i could not get the clasp open to take it back out my work does not allow them and i work early in the morning so i had to go to a piercer at 11 at night and pay 10 for him to use pliers to pry the stupid thing out of my nose so basically I am never going to put it back in and i wasted money buying this dumb thing,93,59
60,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,i really like it it was easy to put in i have not changed it yet so I am not sure how it will be to take out but i love it I am getting a lot of compliments on it,38,60
61,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,shipped super fast i love this ring i get tons of compliments every time i wear it it can be a little flimsy and tricky to get in although,29,61
62,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,barely had it for a week I have received a ton of compliments i like it although it could be a bit too much for some people my only complaint is that it can be a bit difficult to remove,39,62
63,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,it is beautiful too hard to open and i can not clip it closed in my septum to short but i can work with it,23,63
64,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,very cheap quality turned green in my nose the first time i wore it it also will not stay clasped looks cute but you get what you pay for,28,64
65,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,i would give this zero stars if i could got it on time but it would not click in and then the bar on it flat out broke a total waste of money,32,65
66,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,very dainty jewellery but adorable on i haven nto had it long so I am sot sure if there are issues with the finish or anything like that but it is cute,31,66
67,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,too large for the inside of my ear and because pain hard to snap together,15,67
68,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,the nose ring came broken the pin was not attached to the ring itself,14,68
69,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,did not have a problem closing and opening the clicker,9,69
70,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,it is a super slick in the septum it is the perfect size in my nose it is not hanguing there it is like fitted so it is like super pretty also theis like rose gold super cute i love it I have had it for a couple of months and it hasbt worn out but i use it only on special occasions,59,70
140,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,takes less than a second to install and works beautifully keeping any spills from the stove on top of the product instead of falling down onto the cabinet and stove i have a white stove and countertops so it also looks great too i like the l-shaped design which is magnatized so it clings to the side of the stove great product,62,0
141,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,i really like the design of these guards they are l-shaped rather than the other t shaped ones that i have seen the advantage to this design is that your stovetop does not need to be exactly level with your counters for these to work the vertical magnetized side adheres the the side of your stove and the horizontal part rests on top of your counter i have had no problems with the magnets as described by the other reviewer i think the quality of thisis very good,90,1
142,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,the manetic strip separated from the plastic after a couple of days so you see the magnet against the stove this is a piece of junk,26,2
143,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,the magnets hold the strips against the stove so it does not slide around also there is a little play on the height of the stove and counter so strips can go up or down to compensate,36,3
144,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,placed it between therange and the adjacent countertop per instructions good fit after i trimmed about 3/4 off the length to fit my counters after less than one month while frying up a batch of fresh wild mushrooms one night the dang thing melted and warped a goodbut poor choice of materials it needs a higher-temperature resistant plastic it is being used next to a stove fer cryin out loud,74,4
145,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,what a greatstops crumbs grease and more from slipping into the cracks and keeps clean up at a minimal easy to install and keep clean wish i had thought of it sooner,33,5
146,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,they do not fit between my stove and new cabria stone counter top so now using along the side of the deep freezer and the wall so dust bunnies stay out of the,33,6
147,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,the first time i cooked with this on one of the sides warped but i was able to bend it back a bit the second time the magnet started to stick melt to the stovetop and pulled away from the further-warping plastic there has still a bit of melted magnet residue on the side of my stove this is not appropriate for actual use on a stove-top while cooking maybe for looks but not for use waste of money wish i could rate it 0 stars,84,7
148,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,works fine for what it was designed to do especially like the longer length the magnetic strip keeps it in place,21,8
149,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,thought the magnet would be great they are generic magnets not neodymium i did not think about the plastic needing to be heat resistant duh for myrange the plastic seems to be polystyrene they melted / warped the first time i used a large skillet and high er power i ended up buying silicone typefillers they work fine and are much cheaper,63,9
150,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,fit perfect cover my husbands mess up oops laughing out loud,9,10
151,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,it is worked really well at keeping liquids and crumbs from going in between the stove and counter i have really big gaps between them although so i think it would hold up better if that were not the case the magnet strip has come unglued from the plastic which is annoying but i think were my gaps smaller it would have a harder time of doing so but they are still working,72,11
152,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,the website description does not have information about it is material thickness and it is critical since you have to slide it isinto thebetween counter-top and cabinet it only says the length / width / height of the product in my case both edges can not fit into the gaps because it is too thick so it should have this thickness information,59,12
153,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,solved the problem of changing out a glide in stove with free standing with granite countertops the fit was not exact and the extenders solved the problem,27,13
154,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,save your money these warped within just a few months and made them useless the fit was never very good from the beginning,23,14
155,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,the plastic warps i had to shim it so hide the heat warps would have bought the metal ones but stupid amazon would not ship them to canada,28,15
493,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,some of the pens exploded and got ink everywhere so i had to return them they also felt very cheaply made in my hand like they would snap if i held them too tightly so i did not purchase another pack,41,0
494,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,all but one of the pens work well one of the purple pens is unfortunately already dried out the triangular shape makes for easy storage and allows for a better more comfortable grip,33,1
495,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,fine product good transaction a couple of pens seemed a little dry otherwise i would have rated the product 5 stars overall happy with the purchase,26,2
496,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,so disappointed in these markers one was completely dry two barely work several are scratchy and one broke apart the first time i uncapped it and ink got all over the place i feel like i got a different set of markers than those in all the reviews i read before purchasing i will never buy these again,58,3
497,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,love this i use this for my planner to doodle u have alot of different colors to play with it does not bleed through paper,26,4
498,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i bought these to go along with a coloring book of very intricate mandalas so i needed pens or markers that could handle the tiny details of the pictures the fine tips on these pens are fantastic and the colors do not bleed out through the paper plenty of different colors to choose from as well good purchase,57,5
499,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,this is the 3rd batch of markers i received 2day where all the blue ones are dried out weird i guess I am not supposed 2 use blue laughing out loud,28,6
500,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,they work ok they came in fast like 2 or 3 of the pin did not work,17,7
501,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,i got these because they were cheap artist inkers and i wanted to test them out i open the case to find out that the pens were dryed out the tips on some broke off and the caps insides fall apart i say do not ever buy these because they will waste your money,53,8
502,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,tips were broken and several were dried up,8,9
503,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,bought them as a gift recipient was very pleased,9,10
504,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,got these for college went to work on my homework and the grey and light yellow does not work i have not used all the colors yet but now i have to order new ones not happy,37,11
505,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i ordered 2 of these for christmas gifts only some of the pens worked i was past the return date so stuck with them the ones that worked are great,30,12
506,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,first off these are fine tipped markers not pens secondly I have never experienced drawing with something that does not remotely match theof the cap it is like a surprise every time the light colors are dark the five different greens are all roughly the samethe yellows are orange or green and they have run out quickly on the plus side the case is nice and i like the triangular shape and the price was cheap,76,13
507,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the colors are all vibrant 1 of the markers may have had abut after inspecting each and every single one i could not find d it but oh well i love them,33,14
508,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love these i wish i had found them sooner thy arrived before the date that was given i use them for school and also for coloring I have had them for over a month and all the colors are still vibrant and i have not had any issues with the ink not drying fast enough,54,15
509,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,very disappointing these are not thethat the cap says they are at all,15,16
510,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,mis-advertised these are in no way shape or form gel pens they are markers they have fine points and work well as markers but they are not gel pens which is what i was expecting when i ordered them markers can not be blended no glitter and all the colors are extremely dark would not order again,56,17
511,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,nice colors and good for details but i did break the tip of one already by applying too much pressure,20,18
512,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,they have an incredibly cheap feel and are not gel as advertised i will be returning them,17,19
513,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,half of these are already dried out plus the colors do not match lids i picked up a yellow one and thewas deep orange,25,20
514,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i really liked the pens they were nice for a while i used them only for a school year if that is a while but some of the colors dry out faster than others once a pen has been bent or split there has no going back that was the only sad part about these pens,54,21
515,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these are a very nice fine tipped pen work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in there are plenty of colors but i did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper there was only 1 pen that i had any issue with and it was a light green which did not bother me that much since i do not use a lot of the lighter green colors but by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let thedrop and i have not had any issue since the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing the colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you will not lose them anywhere i am attaching a copy of a picture that i am working on right now using these pens for the linework the wording is done with a marker i received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review,203,22
516,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i bought these to use for adult coloring books and a lot of people end up using colored pencils but i wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick is a great variety of colors and it is very sharp clear bright pigmentation I had recommend this to anybod so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book I am not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I shall probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23
517,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i like the colors but when i received them one of the pen exploded and was a mess,18,24
518,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i like the fine line it draws however three of the markers were dried up before i even got to use them disappointing and i probably will not buy their product again,32,25
519,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these are nice pens very fine point they are great for tiny details however they do not blend well when you fill something in you can see each individual line each time you cover over the same area it gets darker due to the fine tip i would not recommend for anything larger however they are great colors and nice quality,61,26
520,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,good set of coloring pens but colors are not as bright as i thought they would be,16,27
521,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,nice pens i wanted a fine line marker to use with my silhouette machine for drawing and writing sentiments these worked perfect they have a pretty good range of colors the nibs are nice and strong also and draw a nice fine line,43,28
522,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,unfortunately these claimed to be gel pens when i purchased them they were not they are fine point markers had i wanted fine point markers these would been marvelous but not what i wanted mis-marked not what i was looking for no good for adult coloring books,45,29

525,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these were pretty good markers they are fine tip and theydecently some colors are basically the same shade but other than that i had no problem they arrived quickly and I have had them for almost a year now,39,32
526,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,there has only one shade of red which is sad but a billion pinks and greens so that makes up for it,21,33
527,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,one of the pens blew up when i first used it i had to throw it away,17,34
528,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,great but one of the pens was leaking in the package when we got it,15,35
529,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,this pens i like so well the way thebut the tips on them do not last i used this set of pens twice and already i had to throw one away because of a bad tip and could not get any ink out and other one has a bad tip on it i was in the middle of a picture when it went bad i was very displeased,69,36
530,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,they come apart when you take the top off to use them a waste of money,16,37

533,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i ordered these to use on my ultra-intricate adult coloring books definitely a fine point works very well on tiny areas i recommend some larger or broader markers for bigger areas as these leave a rough texture to the paper when used toa larger space,47,40
534,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,very scratchy so i ended up giving them to my grandchildren i will not purchase again,16,41
535,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these fineliner gel sketch markers are of a very high quality and have nice bold colors the markers come in a wide array of colors in a reusable plastic container I have only had one markersince I have begun using them they are excellent for mixed media projects mandala colorings zen tangle journaling deconstructing books grocery lists i would not recommend them for huffing nor would they assist you in mentally cleaning out your fridge that is all,77,42
536,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i use these for coloring and they are great products the only down side is that the ink dries out a little too quickly so i have to tap the pen and move the ink around to help the flow,40,43
537,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i was so excited for these pens to comes in and they worked great at first but i have not even finished coloring one page in my coloring book and my dark brown marker is dying i made sure to cap all my pens properly but it is still dying i expect pens to last more than a day,58,44
538,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,many of the colors appear very differently on paper than what you expect based on theof the cap,20,45
539,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,I am a teacher and i love my office supplies i could not wait to try these out they are definitely fine point and there was no running or bleeding as i drew colored and wrote with them i love the variety of colors that come in the pack as well i am excited to use them very similar to the rong thai fine point markers i tried them in a coloring book and because the pages are thick it did not bleed through but not sure i would use them for coloring i did receive this product to try out and review,99,46
540,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,love these got an adult coloring book and these work great for all those little details in those pictures i highly recommend these and can not beat the price also got them quicker than expected so that was nice,38,47
541,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,love these markers perfect for small details they write like pens and the colors are great,16,48
542,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,several of the markers do not workis not in the tip,10,49
543,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,my husband will be thrilled that he has colored markers specifically for drawing these are nice and they come in a hard case so they can travel with him wherever he goes,32,50
544,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love the container of these fineliner pens and the 24 colors are good although a couple of them are pretty close in tone to another still a good set for tiny spaces in adult coloring books,37,51
545,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,not good for adult coloring books they do not glide very well scratchy / dry might be better served for signing signatures or writing text but for coloring in you do not get a consistent fill some places are darker than others and those dark places bleed through was looking to try a new brand to diversify my range of colors i typically use stabilo but unfortunately will have to keep looking,70,52
546,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i love these pens i find that they do bleed through most paper unless it is a very heavy weight paper the colors are vibrant and i use them all the time,32,53
547,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these are the right pens to use with adult coloring books after trying pencils and coloring brush pens i found these work in the tight places the best i tried all of them to see if any were dried up and all were good true toas well you need to replace the lids so they snap on tight to keep them from drying up,66,54
548,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,these just arrived in the mail and at least one of them leaked as they are all covered in a bluish-purple ink theappears new as the blue is all over my hands now as well,37,55
549,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these pens are really awesome i used them when i was studying for my exams because i like for my notes to be colorful and organized my only problem was that a few of them dried out or ran out of ink very quickly i had hardly even used them it was only two or three in the pack that did this and the others still work great,68,56
550,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,using these for my adult coloring books and they are wondeful several coworkers plan to purchase the same product for their coloring books as well,25,57
551,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,terrible absolutely terrible 75 if them are dry they do not fill well very blotchy what an total waste of money,22,58
552,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,they are great for really tiny spaces but when it comes to bigger spaces you really have to take your sweet time,22,59
553,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,i recently bought these pens i have used them three times and four of them are already dry waste of money,21,60
554,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i like the flow of these pens and they only barely bleed through a quality coloring book however the dark green was leaking from the bottom of the pen and was already all over the other pens when it arrived I am sure this was a fluke also for 24 colors a lot of these colors are so similar that it is like I am using the same colors over and over i would have liked more variety in the pack,78,61
555,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,nice markers lots of colors to choose from,8,62
556,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i ordered these to use in an adult coloring book they work perfectly for the extra fine lines that are in the book they do bleed through just a tiny bit so i have a piece of paper in between my pages they do not bleed through the lines for me like other markers did i can be very precise definitely recommend for any coloring or drawing that needs fine detail,70,63
557,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these pens are awesome i got them for coloring in adultbooks they are amazing for small areas,19,64
558,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,very good purchase the price was super they arrived on time prerfectly packed the colors are just as shown in the caps,22,65
559,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,received yesterday but why it is so dirty so dirty i required a new one for my friends gift i am very unsatisfied with this,26,66
560,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,returnedpens were dry after about 30 seconds of use,11,67
561,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,really goodmarkers bc they do not bleed through paper and write better than gel pens,16,68
562,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,they are a very fine point and run out of ink before a project can be completed,17,69
563,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,cheaply made and the there is a inkproblem,10,70
564,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,great pens nice thin tip to make smaller details to handwriting or journaling if you love colored pens or office supplies like me these are amazing,26,71
565,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,the pens were all leaking when i got them so i sent them back for a refund,17,72
566,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,horrible ink flow is blotchy and uneven and the tips of some of the pens are slightly frayed and too hard to make a nice smooth layer ofalso these are listed as pinkrise and they are plinrise for some unknown reason if you have arthritis or fibromyalgia the caps can be difficult to remove the triangular shape is pleasing to the hands although,65,73
567,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,some pens were already dry and unusable very disappointing got much better pens at michaels,16,74
568,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love to write and draw and i am always on the lookout for some great pens and markers i am so glad i got these pinkrise office colored fineliner sketch drawing pen fine point gel ink pen ink width 04mm set of 24 assorted colors they are very nice and come in a plastic case that seals nicely so when you are done you can put them away very neatly and not lose any of them and they write just wonderfully i am very picky about my pens and markers but could not find anything negative about these i absolutely love them i was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion i am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way i am just a regular amazon customer who shops a lot on amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision,157,75
569,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,like others said some where dried out when i received them and seem to run outfast,16,76
570,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,theyand the top breaks the colors are very dark and bleed i do not like them,17,77
571,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,very fine point and awesome selection of colors love these,10,78
572,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,disappointed that some of the markers came dry,8,79
573,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love these markers i was worried about the quality and the price but identification buy them again i love them i was impressed with the size since i wanted extremely small markers and these nailed it,37,80
574,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the lid and the actualdid not always match but i just made achart in the flap of the book for comparison loved the markers over all,29,81
575,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,markers bleed all over my hands they run out of ink right after one use I am completely disappointed i would give them zero stars if there was an option for that i wish i could get my money back,41,82
576,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,was delivered very quickly the colors are great and the pens do not bleed across the page very pleased and would recommend to others,24,83
577,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the triangular shape makes these easy to hold i like a finer tip but for what they are they are good,21,84
578,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,exactly what i wanted no problems with dried pens nice variety of colors super fast shipping i received my set 2 days after i ordered it happy with my purchase,30,85
579,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,not only are they dried up and yes i did shake them and wait a while to use them but some of the tips are split down the middle the colors on the caps are not even close to what the actual ink comes out,45,86
580,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these are great for very detailed drawings the ink seems to stay consistent even after prolonged use also the barrel is triangular rather than round i found it a little awkward at first but it certainly did not cause any issues these would be a great gift for an artist or other creative type maybe paired with an art book regarding shipping i have prime and it arrived within 2 days,70,87
581,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these pens work well but they run out of ink sooner than other brands,14,88
582,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,half the markers were dried out upon arrival waste of money,11,89
583,Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,really disappointing as a noise reducer no noticeable difference does diffuse the exhaust really not worth it,17,0
584,Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,does not block sound that much but it does reduce dust fits shop vacs,13,1
585,Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,thought i was looking for a filter but turned out it was a missing muffler on a friends wet dry vacuum did the job and returned to my friend with added bonus because she did not know it was missing,39,2
586,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this installs easily on the rigid vacuum exhaust port but that is about the only good thing about it it is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it i could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not it is a goodbut really does not work too well,60,3
587,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this product being advertised as a muffler is misleading i observed no difference in sound level i just completed my test it is being returned an effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac this is a viable option for my use since i will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective,77,4
588,Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,the listing for this muffler does not say what size hose it fits there are three sizes when i received it i realized it did not fit my vacuum,27,5
589,Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,my ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106db at 3 feet according to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a dead kennedys concert the muffler reduces that to 105 so maybe a wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler further using an unscientific stick to your face test I had say it reduces suction by about 15 so basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac if you need that and do not want to just tape a sock to the outlet click buy immediately i finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet now i can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her f-16,124,6
590,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,it is a muffler makes the shop vac quiet stays in place does not stick out too far one two three four,20,7
591,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,i did not need exhaust dispersion if i did i would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device to my knowledge none exist i wanted a muffler this does not muffle i took it back the end ps this site will not allow my zero star rating,45,8
592,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,this not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine does not blow air all over from the back of the machine it is a great addition for very little money we were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list,50,9
593,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,i was surprised to see that this muffler received 4 stars when i read the reviews praise was given not because it muffles sound but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust indeed this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my ridgid vacs i bought two of them but i was in a rush and got them locally when we are working on a job site there often is lots of dust imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in it also spreads the dust over an even greater area as other reviewers describe this muffler oh why not just call it air-diffuser redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle this greatly reduces the force of the air it is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler but the difference is too small to spend any money on so in terms of living up to it is name i give it one star,190,10
594,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,this little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac the name is rather misleading as it was not designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction,40,11
595,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,if you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place if you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust this is what you need it can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust,44,12
596,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this is definitely not a noise muffler it is not a silencer either it does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face by redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable i bought this for our new ridgid wd1680 which amazon does not sell the big box store i bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so i got this to go with it used in a garage the vac is surprisingly quiet it seems our hoover upright is much louder i measured the ridgid as-is at 83db with the muffler on it was 83db there was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant i figure it is also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I am going to return it the wd1680 also works as a removeable blower in that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port even although it was the same port with just a tube attachment so bottom line is that this is useless,182,13
597,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart this really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern and also diffusing it with some very porous foam vacuum performance is not hindered it is not really a muffler as the noise level did not change for me but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying it should really come with the vacuum but since it does not its a no brainer purchase,82,14
598,Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,i bought thisfor the rigid shop vac with detachable blower basically the same unit as the sears craftsman version it makes a noticable difference in reducing the frequency of the sound thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit although i can not say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter i do not have a db meter it certainly makes it seem quieter and much more bearable you do have to watch where you point it although because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction although this is by design it is the blower port after all also it not fully inserted it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on worth the money,130,15
828,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,these are yup you guessed it junk they are cheaply made i ripped two of mine trying to install them and they are not universal junk product do not buy these,30,0
829,Automotive,B001TLITTI,2,negative,the seat covers were very nice looking i got plenty complaints but they do not last long they tear up not good material at all,25,1
830,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,i like these seat covers a lot i mainly got them to protect my light covered seats i did not really care for the colors but they are very useful the only thing i do not really like is that you have cut holes for the covers that go in the back for the seat belts,54,2
831,Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,awesome totally transformed the look of my car tight fit,10,3
832,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,descriptions were for lexus-ls430 2006 but when i received the cover they are too small spend money to go to car dealer who were not able to put seats on also none of the covers had accommodating opening for my cay feafures,42,4
833,Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,fast delivery excellent quality it is always looks new it does not wrinkle or out of place as if it is the original seat upholstery,23,5
834,Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,better than i expected very good quality also perfectmatch for the interior of my vehicle,17,6
835,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,bought these for my niece and they are of good quality back seat covers harder to get on but that is the norm leather like material protects from liquid damage can not say how long they will she has only had them for three weeks if they hold up for a year we will be happy,56,7
836,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,these seat lovers are nice enough but the problem is that the backseat covers do not fit a 2014 toyota camry this camry has airbags in the rear that should not be covered,33,8
837,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,these seat covers are pretty darn cool actually it was not that difficult to install at all the only complain is that it does not quite fit my back seats there is no opening in the seat cover for the center consul of the back seat,45,9
838,Automotive,B001TLITTI,5,positive,great product and makes my suv look brand new,9,10
839,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,very low quality said it fits and did not,8,11
840,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1,negative,even being extremely careful and following exact instructions which are lacking greatly in detail they have ripped twice first set and then the replacement set and the 2nd set the primary strap that holds it in place broke great look great price but being gentle and careful when installing i would not buy again,53,12
1230,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,you can get the import of tpd which is only a few bucks more and includes the original as the sixth track after watching lost highway there has no way in he shall identification want the soundtrack,35,0
1231,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,if tpd is a sign of things to come for trent reznor then I am just blown away and anxiously await his new album this fall the perfect drug is a tour-de-force of drum n bass electronica and reznors traditional harsh metal / industrial inspired angst i think he has lightened up a bit too which is also a fresh change,57,1
1232,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,the perfect drug has overdosed how they absolutely managed too slaughter an otherwise good song with these less than stellar versions well trent knew how too create it so it is obvious he knew how too destroy it too he still laughs all the way to the bank avoid unless a collector 25 for a rating i was forced too give it a full star,65,2
1233,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,when i first heard the perfect drug i was blown away it is an amazing song so i of course snapped up the lost highway soundtrack and then this cd when it was released to my complete surprise the perfect drug was not on the disc in it is place were 5 unrecognizable remixes sub-par at best this release was a great disappointment and while the remixes were not all bad they did completely wreck an otherwise beautiful song and that is unforgiveable so needless to say this cd single is best avoided unless you a fan of the remixers or a nin completist,102,3
1234,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,i loved the original version from the lost highway i only found out that i had to buy that soundtrack to find the original version not featured on this overwritten piece to make a long story short buy the lost highway soundtrack,42,4
1235,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,i am going to get straight to the point if you are not a huge nin fan nor are you collecting all the singles and albums i would not recomend you purchase this cd it does not include the original version of the song which is the only good version i have heard only the japanese import includes it as a 6th track i purchased this cd when it came out 10 years ago and i was disapointed the mixes are long drawn out and just do not catch your ear but like i said if you are a collector of nin cds it is essential just like everything else so for that matter it is worth the 6 bucks but if your not a huge fan i would not buy it,132,5
1236,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,just buy the perfect drug versions and the original version is on itunes lost highway soundtrack or one of the we are in this together singles these all all great songs would be nice to have them all in once package,40,6
1237,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,absolute rubbish not even close to the brilliance of the original recording if you loved the original like i did you will hate this,23,7
1238,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,one of my personal favorite halos i think some of the haters have their collective heads up their butts when they say this and fixed are too weird come on get out of your parents dank and dingy basements and live imitation is the greatest form of flattery,48,8
1239,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,i was dissapointed when i listened to this cd all i wanted was the original version of the perfect drug this cd only has the remixes so if you are buying this cd for the original version you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the lost highway instead,49,9
1240,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,not what i thort it was gunna be not that good,11,10
1241,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,this remix album is very interesting featuring 6 remixes the first 2 are amazing and the nin mix is great also,21,11
1242,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,ok people stop bitching about there not being the original version of tpd you all know you already have the lost highway soundtrack anyway so what has your beef and if you do not go get it it is fantastic with or without trents contributions ok I shall get straight to it this was the first nin cd i bought i happened to decide to go to the record shop the very day this puppy was released and picked it up for a song loved it from the get go this was the cd that made me fall in love with nin if nothing else it introduced me to four other amazing artists-luke vibert jack dangers spacetime continuum and orb the only mix that is less than superb is the orb 5 tracks 4 great songs pretty easy to score do not you think,139,12
1243,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,this is one of the first cds that introduced me to remixing and is still one of my favorites this is remixing how it should be it bends the limits of the original work and creates something utterly different and brilliant i personally prefer these versions vastly to the original which is in my opinion not one of trents better songs i was very excited to see the orb and meat beat manifesto in the mix they really brought out the finer and more subtle elements of the song and really made it their own the only nin remixs that i would reccomend more than this would be the telefon tel aviv remix of where is everybody which is absolutely incredible i reccomend it to any nin fan or ttv fan who is open minded and willing to hear what sounds more like a collaboration than a remix a final note to all you so-called nin purists out there who did not like this project because it did not sound enough like the original try making your own remix and see if it comes out even close to any of these maybe then you will change your mind,194,13
1244,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,i do not know why this ep has gotten bad reviews no the original version is not on here whatever if you are a hardcore nails fan you have already got it on the lost highway soundtrack this is definitely one of if not his absolute best remix album every track is absolutely bitchin good for driving and those late nights and wee early morning hours of twilight unless you absolutely hate drum n bass / jungle / techno stuff it is a remix folks you will love this album dammit,83,14
1245,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,do not get me wrong i think perfect drug is one of the best songs to ever come from trent reznors nine inch nails outfit but this cd single is for die hard nin fans only who do not already own the original song featured on the lost highway soundtrack there are five tracks of remixes one of which done by reznor which is the only track that comes close to resembling the original song the other four tracks are loaded with remixed industrial loops and blips that borderline on annoying and is kind of boring these remixes really do not hold a candle to the original and your better off getting the lost highway soundtrack considering this single does not even include the original song all in all this halo is for die hard nin fans only,134,15
1246,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,okay so usually i can be open minded about too many singles filled with too many remixes and not enough original material but I am throwing objectivity out the window and letting fly on this piece of sh te 5 boring and repetitive remixes of the perfect drug and the original version is not even on here get the day the world went away pt 3 and consider yourself saved f ck you reznor,70,16
1247,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,so many of y all might love the original to death to me it is aight it is good but these remixes are even better my favorite tracks off this is spacetime continuums phenominal remix luke viberts smash and trent keiths remix i got to also mention meat beats remix thumbs up the orbs was so-so and was more annoying than amuzing but i give it a play every now and then,69,17
1248,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,i guess i must have been lucky or something because when i bought this ep it had a made in australia sticker on the back and it actually had the original perfect drug on it the remixes are pretty good but none live up to the original,47,18
1249,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,a lot of people probably would be dissapionted with this cd when they hear it because the original is not on here if you want the original buy lost highway soundtrackwere in this together 3or the import of this people that buy this for the original must be kinda blind or something but oh well that is your problem the original song is perfect in every way and to have a whole remix cd deticated to it is great considering all of these remixes are really good too although to have most 4/5 of the remixes buy other people is not really like nin cds it is still really good i just wish more remixes were by nin themself,113,19
1250,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,i remember i bought this cd hoping for the original version of perfect drug and i got 5 remixes that were odd and interesting but not the actual song i had to buy an import release that had a 6th track that included original version,45,20
1251,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,wow this album really and I am highly sure trent would agree with me if you really want to hear the perfect drug buy the lost highway soundtrack because that is the only place you will find the not remixed song along with buying lost highway you will find music that will agree with you such as manson bowie lou reed and ramstein and someone who said this album is closely rivaled with closer,76,21
1252,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,i love the song perfect drug so naturally i bought it is ep that is where i ran into problem 1 the original perfect drug is not on the album sure the remixes are intresting to say the least but each one sans trents version get boring really quickly as they just seem to float in limbo for 7 minutes casual nin fans need not apply but for a halo collector like me well it does not really matter what has on the actuall disc,80,22
1253,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,I am a huge fan of the original version of the perfect drug i love every element aspect and second of the song this ep takes each ascpect of that song and makes new completely different versions of it the meat beat manifesto version is a great way to start out the cd with it is layeryed drumming and symbols this track goes for over 7 mins long this one very song made me go out and buy some mbm albums the plug version is good as well but my favorite from the cd is without a doubt the nin version which is nearly 9 minutes long this track builds and builds and has without a doubt one of the greatest endings in a nin song closely rivaled by closer the orb version well that is the only one i can not listen to over and over it is just far too spacy overall this is a awesome cd which i listen to over and over and even got me into these other bands the only gripe is that the original version is not on the cd but with all these other excellent versions there is no need to complain at all,195,23
1254,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,this is a tragic mistake most of the time trent reznor relies upon himself and a few close collaborators to work on remixing nins music the results are always fascinating and often become equally valid versions of the song in their own right that is why trent reznor always refers to them as versions not remixes here although reznor has got a variety of people together to work on the perfect drug and the results are not worthy of a nin release trent reznors own remix track 3 is excellent and the only redeeming feature of the disc it is very exciting and powerful exploring the driving rhythms of the original now infected with drums and bass but the other remixes do not compare they are interesting enough but for most of the time they have almost no connection to the original song which defeats the point of the exercise buy it for reznors version but do not expect the same excellence from the other tracks,165,24
1255,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,sorry but it is on so many other things that you can still love it there is a remix by nin and one by the orb who seem to have the best remix on here besides nin because this is more of remixes on a maxi-single then just a normal single 4 makes you wonder if you are listening to the perfect drug there is not even words get the original on the lost highway soundtrack closure and we are in this together pt 2 or you may even be insisting on finding it on the damaged box set since it is the witt singles plus things you would not regularly get but still get this,110,25
1256,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,i love nin i could not bring myself to give this disc less than five stars but the only reason i bought this was to complete my collection only the german and australian imports have the original song on the single which mystifies me so do not buy this expecting it to be on there like i said if you are a diehard nin fan and want to complete your collection or if you want to hear the remixes by all means go for it if not buy the lost highway soundtrack or the we are in this together single i do not remember which one it is on there are three we are in this together singles yellow green and orange infrom different countries with different track listings or buy the single for into the void,133,26
1257,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2,negative,okay so I have read that this would be a great cd for serious nin collectors of course if you already are are a serious nin collector then you would have all these tracks already would not you even if you did not own lost highway the original version of perfect drug is on one of the wittn discs 3rd one i think anyway this release has irritated me as much as the last one into the void as it only has pre-released material and before that i had to buy 3 discs for a couple weak remixes trent i love ya man but come on here we waited five years for this regurgitated material is seriously disappointing give us something more,118,27
1258,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,dose this have a halo and if so what is it,12,28
1259,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,this is a fairly good cd but i would not recomened it to a new nin fan as some of the remixes do not sound like nin to much the first mix is the best i only give the united states version two stars but this england / japan import has the origional version of perfect drug on it is as the bonus track i recomended spending the extra money for this version rather than the american version,72,29
1260,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,i loved the original of this song and i love this single these remixes are all interesting because they take certain elements from the song and then mix them up with cuts from the vocals and their own ideas my favorite songs are the ones remixed by spacetime continuum jonah sharp this song made me buy a spacetime continuum cd and the one remixed by the orb i like the piano they included in the middle of this remix the two parts i like best in the perfect drug are the piano and the drums this single is good but i recommend the lost highway sdtk especially if you like nine inch nails because it has 2 other songs trent did,121,30
1261,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,first off if you liked the original song the perfect drug from lost highway then do not but this it consists of trent and 4 bands making strange otherworldly mixes that are almost but not entirely completely unlike the perfect drug if you like interminable incoherent mixes la meat beat manifesto you might enjoy this cd but do not expect it to sound like nin even the reznor / hillebrant mix sounds very little like nine inch nails if this cd included the original unadulterated version of the song it would be worht buying but as it is it offers very little to the nin fan unless you are one of those nuts who absolutely must own every halo it also loses a star for having an ugly purplish cd,129,31
1262,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,when i finally noticed that on the front cover camouflaged with the colors there was the list of the bands that performed each mix when i saw the name meat beat manifesto it made me wonder then when i heard their version of perfect drug i had different feelings for them i love the deep bass in the first track 720 min version by meat beat manifesto listening to that track alone is well worth the price and the reason to buy this certain disc,80,32
1263,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,do not expect to get the original song here you will get cool re-mixes that is it if you want the original song buy the lost highway soundtrack the first re-mix on this single is by meat beat manifesto it is the best one well done the rest are good too but buy it only if you like re-mixes or if you want to add it to your halos,65,33
1264,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,the reason that many are disapointed with nins cds is because they buy it expecting what they get other places music written for radio and to sell cds sure trents music is written in the hope that people can appriciate it but it is not meant for it the singles and remixes are no exception and in fact they are even more geared towards hardcore fans but i will add if you really want the single for this that you heard on the radio get the import version of this cd it is the version that contains the singles that make everyone love a band till the radio likes something else,111,34
1265,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,if anyone is a true nin fan they will greatly appreciate this album it is not supposed to be a pop cd or geared towards comercialism as many people expected rather it is an experimental work as are all nin remix albums an expression as art if you appreciate music that the rest of the world will never hear that has some artistic integrity some creativity and ingenuity get this album do not expect however the original or songs oriented towards a pop culture,82,35
1266,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,there are more then a few nin fans i know who do not like this cd but i guess that could be expected this is definitly off track from most of trent reznors other work none of these mixes are really very close to the original either i would recomend this cd either for people who are interested in electronic music drum n bass especially or who do not mind hearing trent doing something different i agree with the other reviews although you should not own this cd without also having the original version,92,36
1267,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,this is not the song from the soundtrack and i do not care who remixed it the whole cd sounds like you are playing the soundtrack version while flushing your toilet continuously sorry i usually love anything trent does come back to us trent ps splurge on the lost highway soundtrack instead you get the original kick-azz version of the song plus a complete selection of music guaranteed to creep you out but in a good way,72,37
1268,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,if I am ever tired and i want to go to sleep i just pop that cd in and i crash instantly if i ever want to get pumped up to go somewhere i just pop that cd in and I am ready to go,43,38
1269,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1,negative,i enjoyed the original version better you can find it on the lost highways soundtrack plus you get songs by marilyn manson trent reznor david bowie smashing pumpkins and rammstien much better take my advise and buy that instead,39,39
1270,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4,positive,blah blah blah cue whiny voice the domestic does not come with the original buy the import it is only twice the price blah blah blah reality check people the original version is on the lost highway soundtrack an album worth buying in it is own right the 6 more you spend on the import could be put to that and you are getting more than just one song lost highway has numerous quality tracks smashing pumpkins eye david bowies I am deranged a couple from marilyn manson and more what ever happened to practicality,90,40
1512,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,the sound it produces has low quality i bought this and a panasonic at the same time the sound of the last one is incomparably better i do not recommend maxel headphones at least this one,36,0
1513,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the headphones are comfortable but the volume is low even on the highest level compared to other headphones i have used,21,1
1514,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i know these were cheap but with the brand name i expected a little bit more poor quality for sure not even worth the 3 i paid for them just wanted some back-up headphones I had say they only seem like they would be worth 150 at best can not believe maxell would even put their name on them,56,2
1515,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,they are made of 100 plastic the right side did not work on first use they also feel very delicate in my hands like they are easily broken but for the price hey i might have a different opinion if they worked out of the box,44,3
1516,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,nothing special about these headphones cheaply made with pool audio quality i bought similar items at our local discount store for 5,22,4
1517,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,okay quality for the price i use this for my new hires to watch training videos so not a lot of wear and tear,24,5
1518,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,this headset is horrible i brought it so my kids could use it in school and they said it hurts their ears now they refuse to use it and i have no use for it,36,6
1519,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,fell apart first night my son used them i contacted the maxell people because they have a lifetime warranty but it is a joke because not worth the stamps to send them back,32,7
1520,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,they work well they are kind of tight on my head,11,8
1521,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i wish i could give this a negative 100 stars i got it for a big surgery so i could sleep soundly to my favorite relaxing tunes the 1st night it worked great then the entire right side speaker went out never to be heard from again,47,9
1522,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,all i can say is that they work and that is all you get what you pay for,17,10
1523,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,works well enough for my 9 and 10 year olds now i do not have to hear them argue about who laptop is too loud,24,11
1524,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,needed these for my class great price working great,9,12
1525,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,very good headphones sound is very clear highly recommended,9,13
1526,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,great for small children but the size is a bit tight for someone with a larger head,17,14
1527,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the foam covers on the headphones came off the first day granted they were used by teens but we got other similarly priced headphones which have lasted,27,15
1528,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,i teach 6th grade and bought these for my classroom they are a little small for my students heads but adjust to fit ok works well enough and we managed to afford a full class set,38,16
1529,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,tiny like they were made for a doll very very quiet as well could barely hear anything at full volume did i mention they were tiny,26,17
1530,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,my son used this two times and now it is broken complete waste of money and materials,16,18
1531,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,good quality for the price nothing super fancy but they get the job done,14,19
1532,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,they are still alive after multiple uses got them for school use,12,20
1533,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,awful quality i guess you get what you pay for,10,21
1534,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,it is a good thing these are so inexpensive at the price i can not complain too much but i will not be buying them again,23,22
1535,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i like the thinness and the sound is crisp i like these when i lay on my side in bed and listen to otr,24,23
1536,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,can not be beat for the price respectable brand name and functions as expected not anything to write home about as far as sound quality but they serve their purpose as cheap semi disposable headphones great for people who constantly lose and misplace headphones,43,24
1537,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,very cheap one of ear pieces was already broken off in the sealed package when received,17,25
1538,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,arrived on time i bought these for use at the office to drown out the sounds of my office mate singing along to the radio and to discourage him from engaging me in conversation it does drowned out the singing but some people can not take a hint,47,26
1539,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,ear piece is too tiny not very usable,8,27
1540,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,for the price these obviously will not be the best mega-ultra-bass option for listening to music at high volume but they are great for podcasts and audio books you can fall asleep wearing them comfortably enough which i can not do with earbuds or the giant beats style fashionable headphones that are all you can find these days,54,28
1541,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,lightweight and durable enough to utilize in classroom each day,10,29
1542,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,horrible it did not work at all the box is open so i can not send it back just horrible,17,30
1543,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i bought these to use in the classroom they worked out very well the price is reasonable and serves the purpose,21,31
1544,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,perfect for use at school where headphones are constantly broken or lost so far neither has happened,17,32
1545,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,you get what you pay for i need a more expensive pair of headphones,14,33
1546,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,the maxell lighweight stereo headset has for the time i have owned it proven to be the true lightweight good performer that i was looking for others that i have found on the market are cumbersome and provide distorted sound the maxell is the lightest that i have found and provides true clear sound without weighing down the head,59,34
1547,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,we bought two of these one for my mother in law and other for my father in law after hardly a month the fabric from the ear parts started to come off sound started to go dim and then do not remember right or left ear side totally stopped working elderly people were using them with as much care as it was possible even then they hardly worked for such a short time one positive thing about these are that they are very light and do not burden ears,89,35
1548,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,great sound but very small and the so called padding on the head phones are very uncomfortable cheap material and painful on the ears,24,36
1549,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the side strings keep coming off sound quality is good although,11,37
1550,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,very bad reception the sound is like a tin can and breaks up a lot,15,38
1551,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,good sound quality ear sponges a little too thin already breaking through,12,39
1552,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,this headphone set is really small better fitted for a kid,11,40
1553,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,should have purchased a more expensive pair got what i paid for headphones were broken within a week due to the thin plastic at the headband-earphone connection,27,41
1554,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,these head phones are not worth buying they do not work at all and are a waste of money,19,42
1555,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the headphones work ok but when i extend the ear pieces to fit my head the plastic pieces that are part of the extension mechanism end up pressing on the sides of my head it is a design problem stemming for the manufacturers apparent attempt at saving a few pennies on each piece i do not recommend these headphones,59,43
1556,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i was not expecting these to be of super high quality because of the price the problem i had was when i opened them up and realized how narrow the space was to fit around your head as i stretched them apart i thought i was going to break them do not buy these if you are looking to use them for an adult,64,44
1557,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,I have tried numerous headphones for my daughter after a series of purchases that i was not thrilled with i decided to just buy the cheapest pair i could find they are not fancy they do not fit great there has a weird plastic piece near the ear that rubbed against my head when i tried them on but they work they have already lasted longer than most of the other pairs I have bought for her,71,45
1558,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,my son wears hearing aids and prefers these headphones to my panisonic headphones these sound much more tinny or have much more treble than i think most people would prefer for music but the treble amount is easier to her a person speak or figure out lyrics if wearing hearing aids,51,46
1559,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,wanted a lightweight low cost headset and this was exactly what i was looking for,15,47
1560,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,my kids need headphones in a ziplock bag for school ear buds do not work for them these were small enough to fit in the bag and are working well after a few months of use also light and comfortable not too tight on the ears price was decent too do not know why you can not find these in the stores,58,48
1561,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,listening to my oldies on my tablet with hearing aids these work great,13,49
1562,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i bought these through my school for my classroom i bought three pairs my first graders have trouble using them as they are so small 4 days in and one set is broken i guess you get what you pay for,41,50
1563,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,they sound terrible very tinny no bass i suggest for a few dollars more buy the panasonic on-ear stereo headphones rp-ht21 those are decent for les than 10,28,51
1564,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,hurts my ears when i wear it does not fit close to my ears and makes the volume low,18,52
1565,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,perfect for my 2nd grader that needed headphones for school i expected them to break so i purchased 2 pair but they seem to be able to take the torture a 7 year old can give them very satisfied,39,53
1566,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,only one in a pack good for quick use at a low price,13,54
1567,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,cheap but work great for my 6yr that is constantly losing or breaking his headphones,14,55
1568,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,kid needed for school cheap but it is what i was looking for,12,56
1569,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i wanted cheap headphones for a work project and i got what i paid for is that a bad thing no they did a great job and have continued to fit the bill for the last few weeks i have had multiple people use them daily for projects and none of them have given me any problems the sound it great they are very lightweight and have a great range in size they can fit a small head to a quite large one i would recommend this product to anyone that wants a cheap headphone to get the job done,100,57
1570,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,light weight that is the best i can say broke it in less than two weeks ok but delicate take care of it works,23,58
1571,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,fine quality for the price my 8 and 5 year old use them to play on the ipad let us me not listen to minecraft videos which is a blessing worth far more than what i paid kids like them just fine no problems not super sturdy headphones but again for the price they were well worth it,58,59
1572,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,my spare pair which i have not opened yet but which i will when my current simple headphones gives up the ghost,22,60
1573,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i buy these for my kids because they are cheap and expendable they sound cheap they feel cheap they look cheap and they are cheap bump up a whole 3 to the panasonic on-ear rp-ht21 headphones for a significant boost in sound quality build construction and aesthetics,47,61
1574,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i do not like these it feels like they were built for a little kid the sound is good although just not a good fit for an adult head,29,62
1575,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these are way too small for an adult and should be clearly marked as child headphones even my 10 year old daughter complained about the size arrived in an opened and poorly re-sealed package,36,63
1576,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,for a cheap pair of headphones for a kid you can not beat the price,14,64
1577,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,looked used and out of package when arrived,8,65
1578,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,thank you for making this available the price was perfect,10,66
1579,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,bought for working out will not stay on ears and have to turn up volume very loud to use and still hard to hear have had to replace,27,67
1580,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,these headphones are pieces of crap they fell apart within the first month of course it was just after the return period ended the sound is terrible and they are really cheaply made i had purchased another set for almost the same price by jvc and they are 100x better,50,68
1581,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i have bought these headphones 2 times they are too small for the adults in the house but work great for my 4 and 6 year olds the first pair were stepped on and broke so we bought another pair obviously not a product issue but a little kid issue the 2nd pair is still in use when the kids get some vegging time or need time alone it is nice to not hear their games or tv shows esp my daughters favorite you tube videos which can get annoying since it does not fit our heads i do not know how the sound quality is or how loud it can get but my daughter has some audio sensitivities and she will use them so it must not be too bad,131,69
1582,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these headphones were a waste of money the sound quality was very bad always sounded too low them the cord from the right side of the headphones fell out so now it is total garbage these did not even last 6 months i have a pair of panasonic headphones i purchased from amazon in 2013 that are still working very well i expected better from a brand name like maxell i might as well have bought a generic pair from my local drugstore,81,70
1583,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,can not beat them for the price but keep in mind less than 5 many times better than what you would get at dollar store but if you are a stickler audio file might want to try higher quality,37,71
1584,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,cheap and foam on earphones wears out quick,8,72
1585,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,fabulous sound super lightweight i really like them great price too,11,73
1586,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,after using these headphones for a short time i can only hear out of the right ear there are better choices for the cost of these headphones,27,74
1587,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,super fast shipping and arrived exactly as expected,8,75
1588,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i know i should keep my expectations low given the price but these are probably the smallest least comfortable and lowest quality headphones I have ever had spend an extra 2 and get a better pair,35,76
1589,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,very comfortable horrible sound quality i could not return them after tossing the box so they went in the trash,20,77
1590,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i bought these instead of other ones I have purchased for my classroom in the past these when my students pulled the foam off the ears had wires exposed at least the other cheap headphones i had were just exposed plastic speakers when the foam came off i would not recommend these to anyone,53,78
1591,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,foam is really thin and flimsy very uncomfortable for my students,11,79
1592,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i actually ordered 5 pairs for my father he uses headphones every waking moment especially on the weekdays with his news talk shows on the radio so he goes through headphones a lot either they get worn and the speaker goes out in either side or one of our 3 cats get a hold of it and chew it to pieces dad cracked up at the fact that i got him so many because he knows how much he goes through he loves them,84,80
1593,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,i bought these for my three kids tablets you get what you pay for these were the cheapest pair i could find and they are made just that way cheap they serve the purpose but the foam piece on the ears is already coming off right out of the package and when my son put them on i heard a craking sound and it was the slide adjuster piece that needed snapped back into place on each side he has to do that every time he puts them on i guess I am going to adjust them to his 9 year old head and tape them my younger kids have the same problem,112,81
1594,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,cheap enough for a 4 year old when they break your are not out a lot of cash,17,82
1595,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these are worth exactly what we paid they are cheap and will not last long but totally functional,17,83
1596,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,great for the price the kids use them as headphones for the computer as this price no worries if they get broken,23,84
1597,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,if you are looking for inexpensive lightweight headphones these work well i just needed a pair of very lightweight headphones to listen to am talk radio and i did not want to spend a lot so i bought a couple of these so far so good i have other mid to heavy duty headphones when i want to listen to music and want the sound to be higher quality i have been using one of the pairs that i bought daily for the past several months and it is holding up well,92,85
1598,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,the headphones sound fine but came with a wire protruding through one of the ear pads i was able to bend the speaker wire back into the plastic covering and hold it in place with hot glue the price is great since they cost less than some places charge for ear pad replacements,53,86
1599,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,perfect cheap retro headphones for my halloween costume sound is adequate too,12,87
1600,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,i work in a middle school special needs classroom we have 2 autistic boys in the room who spend their daily computer time watching movie clips from various childrens movies and tv shows they usually watch the same clip over and over and over it gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously they were using ear buds when watching their clips but those broke before the holidays after a week of no headphones i decided to order these for them i actually ordered 3 pairs one for each of our classroom computers these are not super high quality headphones but they are working great for our students yes it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice padded over the ear earphones but we do not since these were purchased with my own money this was what was in my budget I am not sure i would order these for myself but for the students they do the job,163,88
1601,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,not too expensive so not such a loss when kids break them at school i bought some others that were almost 10 each and was really upset when they did not last more than a couple of weeks,37,89
1602,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,it is not good buy panasonic volume is lower they are smaller and fragile they fit any size head but they are small and too flimsy pictures make em look bigger,28,90
1603,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,cost ok fits flat on ears with wire to left side one wire a good thing reasonably thick with good male plug wire attachment is weak due to lack of moulded strain relief strain relief is loose tube which is better than nothing perhaps a little glue between the wire and tube would be an improvement sound is not loud and is not as good as my other cheap memorex padding is thin foam which probably helps by providing friction to keep the speakers in place on the ear,89,91
1604,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,the sound is not good and it is too small and tight do not feel comfortable when you put it on,20,92
1605,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,works well for the price do not over-drive them and they will last you a while good price and performance for a cheap headset,22,93
1606,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,great cheap headphones decent sound quality lightweight ear pieces are smaller than some but are good sized,17,94
1607,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,they work fine and the price was amazing and they came in the mail super fast,16,95
1608,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,sound was too weak for my hearing impaired mom,9,96
1609,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,was a gift for a friend who said they liked it,11,97
1610,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,they were flimsy like the dollar store ones i was disappointed i could have purchased better ones for the money,20,98
1611,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these are great i got these for my better half he likes them very much he did not want ear buds so these are great,24,99
1612,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,you get what you pay for with these no bass and flimsy but for only 5,16,100
1613,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,cheap small not comfortable would not recommend spend more and purchase higher grade headphones,14,101
1614,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,they fit but the sound quality is not great,8,102
1615,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,product worked as advertised and am pleased with results,9,103
1616,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i love the behind the ears feature i can lie down and drift off to sleep while i listen to my favorite books,23,104
1617,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these will be used in the car for grandsons portable childrens dvds lightweight and work well,16,105
1618,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i have already written a review for these little headphones they are small and you get what you pay for i love them because they fit my pea sized head they are also cheap enough that if i sit on them or they do break i can replace them without tears the sound is not incredible but definitely okay i use these more than the more expensive pairs i have bought they are small enough to fit a child and if you are hard on your headphones these are a great little extra pair to have around i really enjoy mine,101,106
1619,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,these headphones were defective when they arrived only one side was working and the volume on the other was very low amazon replaced them but the replacement had the same problem,31,107
1620,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,these do not fit tight enough to really hear the music,11,108
1621,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,i know i did not spend much on these headphones but they are incredibly flimsy bend easily and do not stay on,20,109
1622,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,love these yes head phones wear out and break but these last pretty well and are light weight,18,110
1623,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,these are in the goldilocks zone just right-just right-just right they are just the right price to feed to my 8 and 11 year old both of whom have breakable tendencies six of these lasted 9 months an absolute bargain compared to the more expensive sets i was buying based on an assumption of robustness these are just right so that they can be hauled around dropped kicked jammed in the bottom of a backpack and they just spring back it takes quite a lot to do them in and in the meantime blessed silence since each child is welcome to plug their headphones into their tablet so that the rest of the house does not have to listen to game-play or inane music for hours on end a lifesaver on a plane roadtrip and more for ears too small to accept earbuds these are the perfect compromise the sound is tolerable for games or light music listening not a lot of dynamic range for this price point but that is not what I am praising them for,173,111
1624,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,my son got this for christmas and loves it it is very lightweight good buy,15,112
1625,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,great head set for the price I am not suggesting that they are pro level sound but work great and have good sound quality i also like the single cable as they stay out of the way more you can not beat it for the price and if you have prime you are almost getting them for next to nothing thanks amazon,60,113
1626,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,great product buying process was smooth and easy shipping was fast a pleasure to do business with i would recommend this company to everyone,24,114
1627,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,good value for an inexpensive set of headphones,8,115
1628,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,i like these headphones lightweight i am ordering another pair and the price is reasonable,15,116
1629,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2,negative,cheap cr p you get what you pay for the chord is short the sound quality is atrocious the snap that holds the moveable part broke in a month,28,117
1630,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these were great headphones i am on the phone most of the day and these headphones are so comfortable i can hear the customers crystal clear,26,118
1631,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,these headphones were great for the money i use them to run of course the sound quality is not great look at the price i broke them the other day and was not even angry because at this price i can just get another,42,119
1632,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,good sound fit nicely kids all loved them better for your ear s then the ear buds for sound and for comfort,22,120
1633,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1,negative,big disappointment with maxell they should sell these at the dollar store this is one of those products where you wonder why did they even bother,26,121
1687,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,warning do not buy these radios i have alot of experience with two way radios i live and work in the mountains of montana and i know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios I have had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers anyway i feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking it is slight but very noticable with regular use i feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can not be certain in addition the sound of the audio is horrible i was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply is not worth it the sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe motorola should recall this product it a serious dissapointment from a company who has name typically means quality these may be the worst radios i have ever owned sorry folks this pair of radios are not worth the box they are shipped in,194,0
1688,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,the product worked but only about 500 yards this may be due to trees and more i suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation,27,1
1689,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,the ordering and shipping on this product was super fast i received it a few days after ordering like the product plan on using it for outdoor activities would recommend this product and it is cheaper than i saw advertised anywhere else,42,2
1690,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios it was frequently very difficult / impossible to understand what the other person was saying confirmed in both directions this was not an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such simply it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded i have an fcc license and have owned numerous motorola radios over the years this set was a real disappointment a radio that can ideally communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can not understand what the other person is saying even from a very short distance away furthermore the housing of these radios lacks durability the rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone just cheap-feeling plastic now,128,3
1691,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,the motorola 9500 was strongly recommended however the set that i received turned out to be a piece of junk very poor voice clarity and quality we depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor to the point of just not using them which put us in a very unsafe position at times i did call motorola and was informed that i was past the warranty time and they would do nothing my recommendation is to buy a set of midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators,108,4
1692,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this is the first pair of two-way radios i have used they work very well voice is clear i tested the range of these units by driving away from the other user we kept talking until the signal began to break up which was about 7 miles your mileage may vary this was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees these units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation,74,5
1693,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,used the motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip great communications with day long battery life and swapping in aa batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions great radios a good buy at a great price,42,6
1694,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,product is extremely easy to use used while on vacation in the islands on a cruise it is an ideal method for communiction when you are with large parties clarity is not bad but not great worked better in open areas,40,7
1695,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,this radio has adequate power and the audio to get out i highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors rather than weak 5 watt frs radios i found them larger than many in this class and a bit under powered at only 2 watts maximum but ok however it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the remanufactured sale list quite often i suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on or it could be something else if lots get returned and resold it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process in any case buy with caution,118,8
1696,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,despacho eficiente y en los tiempos de entrega considerados en cuanto al producto es un buen juguete para los nios tiene sus limitaciones en alcance,25,9
1697,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,pros used with other motorolla and non motorolla radios and the sound quality was good battery holds charge for several days in normal use cons 25 mile range is bizarre because the most that i got was about a mile and a half,43,10
1698,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,it is a great product especially for the price amazon offers it for stores sell the same two way radio for the same price but does not have the 25 mile capability it was a great deal,37,11
1699,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i have not tested these for their full 25 mile range but they seem to work well enough around the office complex and at the park the 2 mile range for urban areas that other reviewers have stated seems to be about right i might have actually gotten more than two miles but i also live in los angeles where we do not have very many tall buildings overall they work well enough for casual use but i would not consider them for more critical applications,83,12
1700,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i have not had much chance to use it as i purchased it for use as an emergency preparedness block captain in my city we have practiced using it but i will not really know until a disaster of some type happens i am pleased to have it for that purpose,51,13
1701,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,despite the problems some other reviewers have reported i have not seen them myself the radios could be more durable but for the money they seem like a good value some friends of mine recently took them beach camping and said they had no trouble with the signal although the users were never more than a few miles away from each other the kids liked the interchangeable covers,67,14
1702,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,the motorola t9500xlr seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment once out of the packaging the 2 units are charged via a cradle i have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well first off keep in mind these are not professional level radios they are merely entry level units for home and family use they are ideal for road caravans amusement parks shopping malls cruise ships and more as other reviewers have mentioned the voice over the speaker is tinny and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible the range is definitely nowhere near the claimed 25 miles in a typical setting you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country just remember these radios cost around 50 for the pair and you simply can not expect professional quality at this price point the noaa radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle overall i wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature,182,15
1703,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,this is my second pair of two-way radios the first set picked up quite a bit of extraneous noise wind staticbut this pair worked much better and was clearer we used them for two days my son and i to try them out at the beach at home and at a big park once we found the right channels they worked perfectly all places i did try to test the distances difficult while walking but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine there was a bit a static at the beach but not too much they are not as clear as your cell phone but if you are out and about at a amusement park or park with your child they will work fine,129,16
1704,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,although the radios had some good features the bad sound quality trumped all of them i had to frequently ask for repeats because the sound was so bad even at close range i do not know whether it is really cheap speakers or bad processing but it sounds like you are talking down a long length of plastic tubing there are other radios for under 10000 that work much much better i just returned the t9500xlrs,75,17
1705,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,these radios have worked well for what i use them for and they keep there charge not more buying batteries they work well,23,18
1706,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,got these so that we can tell our 9yo to come home works with other brands too uniden for sure so he can also communicate with his friends who have other brands while they are playing,35,19
1707,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,for all of the features and capability they put into these radios motorola forgot one key element sound quality other reviews that mention can not understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away are not referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers with only a passing knowledge of audio electronics it would seem that motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker as the sound is very clipped sounding and horribly distorted they could also use a modest compressor on the input as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker for a radio that is marketed as a family product they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk after 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it i still could not get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out these are getting returned unfortunately as they seem to have all the features i want we will try again with midland i think,183,20
1708,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i love these walkie talkies the sound quality is great and they feel good in your hand i have not had a chance to try them camping but am anxious to do so please note that 25 mile range is optimal when you are in a non populated area with no trees,51,21
1709,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,motorola has done it again these radios work excellent and i would not buy anything else,15,22
1710,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,do not buy the motorola handled radios without this or the ear phone based product if you plan to use the radio in a noisy environment particularly if they are required to wear hearing protection even with the vibrate alarm our employees were often missing talk requests with the clip on speaker and microphone the sound is placed closer to the ears and is heard much easier the radio also need not be removed from the worn position to talk back,80,23
1711,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,the original units would not work right i called morotola and they said those were the deffective ones they sent me new ones that work just fine i sent the old ones back so they could experiment on them motorola provided post paid return envelope a good final experience it pays to go with a name brand that has service department and cares about their customers,64,24
1712,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this is the second pair of radios i buy so that each member of my family has one products works very well and is very useful for our family vacations both at the beach and at the mountains,38,25
1713,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,wow what junk these worked fine for about two weeks then worked intermittently and are now dead now comes the hassle of sending them back to motorola and probably paying more to have them fixed than buying new ones these never should have made it off the drawing board,49,26
1714,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,after owning 2-way frs / gmrs radios by bellsouth cobra and motorola motorola radios were always the highest quality they may not have been the best in every area but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked the last 3 models I have owned have all been motorola i purchased the t9500xlr their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio the other day to replace my t4900s i was appalled at them the sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older cheaper t4900s and worse yet the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually at any range and at any transmit power whether in the next room or half a mile away the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out no settings affected this i ordered a pair of midland gxt710vp3 radios instead they are way better they are what the t9500xlrs should be,147,27
1715,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i purchased these to replace my aging t7200s but there is no comparison the 7200s are far better the 9500xlr have very poor sound quality very tinny like talking in a can the volume does not go high enough and the reception is poor i spent a few days using these two models side-by-side and the weaknesses in these radios jump out immediately i am happy to say that amazon accepted my return do not make the same mistake i did look for a different model,84,28
1716,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this has been very useful not just for fun but at remote locations of work related business i would suggest easier menu layout the ability to silence ptt confirmation better clip design recommended overall best buy considering what is out there,41,29
1717,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,do not like thisdo well to get 2 mile range can not understand what other person says 1/2 mile away,20,30
1718,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,we bought these for christmas and they were hours of fun the entire week afterwards the boys especially love to use them for air-soft wars because you can wear earphones with them and turn them on vibrate the only complaint we have is that they do not seem to work long-range we had them on vacation took one for a drive in the car and left another at home we lost contact in about 1/2 mile i will say that we did not play around with that feature too much so maybe there is something we could have done to get a longer signal do not know but they are great fun for around the neighborhood,116,31
1719,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,the audio quality is really poor compared to other manufacturers you can not understand other users even over quite short distances and this not helped when the signal keeps dropping in and out whatever you do do not be beguiled by the motorola name and do not expect any support from motorola regarding this problem they will not do anything about these poor quality products i complained to the uk and united states offices of motorola and both fobbed me off i have some really cheap uniden radios which have a superb sound compared to these you can expect better quality from two tin cans and a length of string than motorolas t9500xlr radios,116,32
1720,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,i got these radios because i own two talkabout t5950s i figured that i would upgrade to a newer better model was i wrong they do transmit farther than my prevous model but you can not understand what is being said i am a loyal motorola fan but they had betterup the qaulity i will be returning these radios and i will go back to the old stand-by for another year,72,33
1721,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,this was a real bad decision when people say it all in the name they do not mean motorola t9500r,19,34
1722,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,great price and loaded with man features hard to imagine not going with motorola,14,35
1723,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,these radios are the worst you can not hear anything it does not matter if you are 5 feet away from the other person or 100 feet they look nice but that about covers it i have nowhy they are still being sold and have not had a recall on the up side i called motorola and they are aware of the problem they are sending me new ones and a different better model they are also sending me return postage so i can send them these awful things back i will let you know how the new ones are,101,36
1724,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,purchased two twin packs of the t9500r radio and the sound quality is so poor they are absolutely useless for transmitting i can hear other radios well enough but any transmit attempts are not understood by other radios do not purchase,40,37
1725,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,i bought these because the mini club i drive with use 2-way radios for communication the came with headsets and either with or without them it was almost impossible to hear what people were saying range was poor too save your money and buy something cheaper these just do not live up to their claims,54,38
1726,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,they work well are a relative bargain and are nice and small the preferred radio for mt biking,18,39
1727,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations until now I have been very happy with many different motorola and midland models the t9500 has great features but the sound quality is lousy which makes it virtually unusable,40,40
1728,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,we use 6 8 handheld radios at our business to communicate across multiple floors and buildings we have gone through two generations of motorola talkabouts with this line being the third these are the worst of them all the last generation of blue and black ones was fairly bad with several ceasing to work within days of purchase and so we thought we would upgrade to the next model up of the 6 we purchased 5 did not have adequate sound transmission cutting off at the beginning and end of transmission or not working at all these are junk do not waste your money my one star is because they are attractive to look at,116,41
1729,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them the voice clarity does not exist no one is able to understand anyone it cuts out sporadically i would say that the distance is terrible also but i can not tell if the radio is cutting out or i just can not understand anyone called moto and they actually confirm that there is a problem with this and another new model they recommended that i get the sx800r model at first they would not even take it back oh the noaa channels are great and clear design is also good,103,42
1730,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,wow have walkie-talkies changed in four years these are packed with some pretty sophisticated features including noaa weather alert and are very user-friendly strongly recommend,25,43
1731,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,as many people have noted the audio quality of these radios is terrible i also had an issue with the radios cutting out on me and times when i had to turn the radios off and on just to get them to communicate again,44,44
1863,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i would just say on this pot and pan cover that it is heavy weight cover and must be a different one that i saw before i purchased one i thought it was going to be real light but when i received it it was definitely a heavy weight lid for 10 it was a real bargain they must have made it heavier since the one in the article do not buy a 12 inch one this is good for only a 10 inch it is excellent,85,0
1864,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this lid with it is double-ply construction is much better than those available locally in the kitchen departments of discount and hardware stores it has no sharp edges it arrived a little bent but was easily straightened it would have been nice if the description included the fact that it was aluminum this should not be assumed,55,1
1865,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,this thing is tiny too small to cover my 10 inch frying pan guess i should have paid more attention to the dimensions into the trash it goes,28,2
1866,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,i received this and it was all scratched up and look used do not waste your money,16,3
1867,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,sad that a made in united states item is so flimsy was delivered with minor dents and discolored when used to cover a frying pan containing sliced potatoes prior review that mentions not good for covering 12 pans is misleading it barely covers a 10 1/4 8 griswold ci frying pan,50,4
1868,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,have a number of odd-ball or miscellaneous pots and pots you want a lid for it but it either never came with one or you have lost it your savior is at hand i have been using mine for years and is pretty beat-up and abused the fit is kinda awkward for smaller pans the fit is usually rather loose plus it will not fit 12 inch skillets still i love mine and would never give it up you might want to consider another brand that will cover a 12 inch pan,92,5
1869,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i wanted something really light weight to keep in our rv and this one does the job perfectly it is very light weight and it would honestly be easy to bend but it is perfect for what i wanted it for,39,6
1870,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,perfect for cooking bacon hamburgers or anything that splatters it is 10 in diameter and can fit all pots for that size i highly recommend this cover,27,7

1876,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,this arrived bent and it was flimsy and pretty much a piece of junk unfortunately i needed it immediately so i could not return it while i did not expect it to be a stellar piece of equipment i did expect it to be a little bit more substantial than the lids on my grandsons toy cook set would never buy it again,64,13
1877,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,way overpriced poor quality something you would find in a dollar store,11,14
1878,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,arrived quickly product was just as described not heavy-duty or for everyday use but works great as a universal pan / pot lid for occasional use it is a bit over-priced,28,15
1879,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i like the lid but the ridges are hard to clean guess i should have expected that,17,16

1886,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,good everyday cover that fits a variety of pots it did warp a very little either in transit or it was shipped that way,24,23
1887,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,complete crap the lid is very thin and does not insulate the food when it is cooking it was already slightly bent when it arrived but i was able to bend it back straight again most importantly it does not fit all pots well at all the handle on most pots is angled in a way that it does not let the lid lay flush on top so the whole reason for having a lid is lost do yourself a favor and skip this product,85,24
1888,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,pen was not the right size i needed a university cover that was larger it did not cover my large teflon skillet was two inches too small,27,25
1889,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,purchased this for my brother he loves it it fits his fry pan perfectly one review said it dented easily and my brother does not understand how this could happen because he thinks the lid is quite sturdy,37,26

1891,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,the lid is not as wide as i had thought so i can not use it on very many skillets this is my fault as i did not measure everything but it is a good product for the money,36,28
1892,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,i have a universal lid that i love so i thought I had buy one for a friend but this model is a bit flimsy and smaller than ideal,28,29

1904,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,inexpensive covers that do the job one arrived with a ding but no big deal they do what is intended,20,41
1905,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,it works as it should i did end up flipping the knob to the other side so that the lid would not be resting on the handle of my smaller pans it is a bit overpriced seems like something you would find in a thriftshop for 50,45,42
1906,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,wish i could return this tornished after first wash in dish washer really thin and flemzy,16,43
1907,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this pan cover is very thin and simple but it does the trick does not fit over our large crab pot bit fits over just about everything else no problems so far we have had it for months,40,44
1908,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i like this product but if you have a pan with has a handle that raises above the level of the pan this top will not lay flat and steam will escape,32,45

1915,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this works well for me it is not a perfect fit as other reviewers have noted but with the graduated sizes you move it around a little to find the best fit for your pan i just appreciate it stops any splatter most importantly amazon has fixed the problem of these lids arriving dented with airbags and in a big box my lid arrived in perfect shape,69,52

1919,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,the metal is pretty thin on this but it serves it is purpose i use it when my family goes camping so it does not get used a lot i like that it will fit lots of different size pots and pans,40,56

1922,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,lid arrived with dents all over it and with the black top / handle missing from the other reviews this is a habitual problem the dents were so bad that the lid would not collapse properly the lid itself is also extremely flimsy i returned the lid right away and would not advise anyone to purchase it,54,59
1923,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,so many skillet sets come without a lid this lid is perfect for the 2 pan set i purchased for my college son in his first apartment,27,60
1924,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i love this pot cover the handle does not get hot so i do not have to find a pot holder to pick it up it is very light which is great with my arthritis it fits beautifully over my medium size omelette / fry pan i can place my favorite ingredients for a vegetable cheese fritatta withwhites in the pan cover it with this 10 cover turn the burner down to very low and wait until it hardens into a perfectveggie pancake then i quarter it 4 wedges and have 4 breakfasts ready to go when i am in a hurry i like that it does not fit so tightly that it can not breathe a little it does lie flat and that is good enough for me i also bought the same pot cover in a16 size to use in my very large fry pan for poaching salmon also very slowly in 1/2 cup chardonnay water to cover 2 - 3 pepper corns lemon juice bayfresh parsley and a slice of onion only takes a few minutes on low once it boils both covers are the ones i use the most in my kitchen,194,61

1929,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,arrived bent badly so soft i could easily bend it back with my fingers only marginally more effective than foil returned at once,23,66
1930,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,what can you say about a well priced product that solves the problem and dose it is job i like it,20,67
1931,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,very poor quality grooves are two shallow and it foes not stay on my pan and pots securely it is better than no cover at all although,27,68
1932,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,must not be exactly 10 inches did not fit pot too small for a 10 inch round pot flimsy material,21,69
1933,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i like this a lot originally i had no covers love the face that i do not have a dozen lids floating around on the smaller side than expected but still a good buy,33,70
1934,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i would like this same lid in a 12 version it works pretty good for 10 skillets it makes a good spare for my dutch oven that shares a lid with one of my skillets,35,71
1935,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,I have had this lid for years and although i still used it the handle was loose and it was so old i could not tighten the screw when i saw these i ordered myself two use them every day they are light quick fit well in dishwasher and they fit most anything love this reasonable lid,55,72

1938,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,not worth the price a rip off probably worth a 150 but no more i would not recommend anyone buying this,22,75
1939,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,fits all my pots and pans had one but had given it away glad i was able to get another one,21,76
1940,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,looks great and fits my pan thank you very much i have larger pans that i could use a bigger cover for 12 inch,28,77
1941,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i wanted a replacement lid for a 10-inch dutch oven and was trying to save money by not buying a glass lid one amazon reviewer said about this fitz-all lid i love mine and would never give it up that was a great endorsement so i bought one it is 10 1/8 inches in diameter the aluminum has a concentric circles design with a very slight concave to the underside the lid sits flush on top of my dutch oven with no lip orto keep it from sliding no problem although and it does a good job keeping in the steam when slow simmering chili or spaghetti sauce make sure to measure the pots you have to see if it will fit the 10 1/8 size my dutch oven is cast iron inner diameter 9 7/8 inches and outer diameter 10 1/8 inches which works fine with this lid i have not tried it on smaller-sized pots / pans yet but that is supposed to be one of it is advantages handling a range of sizes,175,78
1942,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,this is a joke it looks and feels like the toy pots and pans sets we used as children it is not big enough to cover most pans and it is too lightweight and cheap cheap cheap cheap do not waste your money,40,79
1943,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the lid was already bent when i got it just a bit but just taking it to the kitchen using it the first time it was all bent out of shape from being thin soft material so it did not fit the pots tight went to wal mart and came across a really good one that is half glass,59,80
1944,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,these covers are flimsy thin but it would have still serve the purpose i had intended for them if they were smaller i did not realize that they were so big i needed smaller pot covers so these are just not suitable,41,81
1945,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,it looks really ugly and is very small for even small pans i do not recommend it to any one,20,82
1946,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,can cover something will simmering then use same lid for another fry pan or pot less clean up just are very useful product,23,83
1947,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the first time i used the cover it warped now it does not seal thebetween the pan and the cover the steam pours out it was a cheap product at a cheap price,34,84
1948,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i was super angry when my pot lid shattered into pieces most other replacements were super expensive and this one is cheap and affordable and gets the job done it will not be a snug fit on your pot but i did not need it to be so it worked great for me,51,85
1949,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,my own fault that i did not measure my pan but other than that this works a little better than using a plate to cover your pan because you can grab the knob and not burn your fingers mine came with the knob sort of bent and a small dent but I am quite sure that was because of poor packaging shipping was quick although,63,86
1950,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,i was trying to save some money on 8 - 10 in pan lids as a result I have wasted my money on these very poor quality not safe around the kitchen they get so hot in instant if you missed the handle you may get burnt easily go with the real glass ones 3x/4x more expensive although but in a long run it is totally worth it,65,87
1951,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the picture appeared to be a pot and pan top of quality very low level of a top i would not recommend to purchase does not hold head well when cooking does not clean well,35,88
1952,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,i received this full of dents with a screw and no handle the only reason i am not returning it is because it will cost me more to send it back then what it is worth i have been looking for a cover for months then found this and thought it was the end of my search forget it a peice of crap do not order this product,70,89
1953,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,as others have mentioned it is made of aluminum and very big on small pots and pans still it meets the basic need,23,90
1954,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,my boyfriend and i have all sorts and brands of pans from over the years and have misplaced lids this works well on all our pots thanks,27,91
1955,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,this lid is flimsy but better than nothing it also does not sit adequately on the pot if you have handles on your pot,23,92
1956,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,great for those lidless pots it fits any pots up to 10 only drawback is that it does not fit my largest frying pan which is 12,26,93
1957,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i use this lid every day it replaced one that was years old the size is perfect it fits every pot I have set it on,25,94
1958,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,when i received the package it was already bent up probably because it is not made very well the metal is thin and if you throw it around too much it will definitely bend i suppose it is good for your most basic needs but other than that do not be afraid to dish out a little extra to get a better lid,59,95
1959,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,I am not sure what lid the other reviewers received who said that theirs was flimsy because the one i received is very strong it would be hard to bend or dent this it is small but it is perfect for small pans i like it,44,96
1960,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,it does what i need it to do it is very light weight and would be easy to bend out of shape but it is the answer to a need i have other pots and pan lids are just to big,39,97
1961,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the description says that this lid fits all but it does not and the material is so cheap i needed it for a casserole that i have bought from goodwill but it did not even come close and it is a 16 casserole,41,98
1962,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this is a must-have for users of many skillets that lack lids or for those who do not want to clutter up the kitchen with tons of glass lids i agree with the reviewer who said it is flimsy which is why i gave it four stars instead of five mine had a teeny tiny dent in it but really no biggie not as good quality as the old one i have but useful nonetheless as i need one for home and one for the camper,86,99
1963,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,there has nothing wrong with this lid other than i did not think it through in terms of size before ordering this is not big enough for a large fry pan I shall keep it anyway since it is a decent lid or other pots but if you need it for a large fry pan you need at least 12 1/2 lid and this one is only 10,65,100
2066,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,this is bigger than most trunk jack stands i bought this for my mazda 6 2008 does the job good price soild metal,23,0
2067,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,the crappy little jack that came with my prius fell over when lifting the prius on the flat street in front of my house when it fell it bent i went to replace it and discovered it was 179 or something like that this looks have not used it yet twice as strong,52,1
2068,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,thiswas just as described in the ad and arrived on time it is nice to get a great deal,21,2
2069,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,the jack i ordered was not able to lift my car and was slightly different from the product advertised the company responded with several different options to meet my needs and included detailed information about the replacement options along with pictures i still do not know of the replacement items will do the job they have not arrived yet but the company gets a gold star for working hard to help me,69,3
2070,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,i used four of the jacks as leveling jacks on my small travel trailer i had to modify them to be permanently attached to the frame of my rv they are sturdy and work well for my purpose if you simply want them as a car jack for changing a tire i believe they will suffice the maximum height extension is limited about 18 20 so keep that in mind,71,4
2071,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,it is a car jack after all and a good one it does it is job well and it is easy to use no complains about this product i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a car jack,41,5
2072,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,i bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well it did fit but it would not lift a 1000 lbalthough rated for 4000 lbs the screw was well lubricated with grease but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank it was cheap but still not worth the little money i paid,63,6
2073,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,cheap fell apart after 2nd use i was lifting my golf cart and it got stuck about half way through the lift i kinda worked with where it was when i was done i went to lower it and noticed it bent with such a littlei bought two of them the bent one went into the recycling bin and other is a garage paper weight,67,7
2074,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,this is a substitute for my 2500 and horse trailer jack works well too,14,8
2075,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,very poorly constructed rated for 2 tons but would not lift 1 tire of my 3000 pound car also it arrived damaged the put the jack in a box too small and simply punched holes in the end of the box for the two ends of the jack so of course both ends of the jack were damaged by the time it arrived,62,9
2076,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,i am not putting this in my wifes car that is what i bought it for but after opening it and extending it out i could see that the metal arms were loosely put together and rickety the screw mechanism is good and smooth but i do not trust this thing to hold up 4000 lbs without creaking one way or the other returning for sure I had rather hassle with sending it back and buying another one than worry every time i crawl under the car i recommend avoiding this jack,90,10
2077,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,the threaded rod or screw was galled up right out of the box was unable to even open it up all the way until i put the jack in a benchto hold it in place why i used a crow bar to work it back and forth 50 times to get it to free up at least they should test this piece of crap before they ship it after working on it for two hours i finally have a jack i can use,85,11
2078,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,jacks situation here in the us is a mess have to use a combination of jacks to change a flat scissors jack is just one that i use,28,12
2079,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,like someone else said it is a car jack what do you expect it was not built to lift the world,19,13
2080,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,the jack i received was somewhat different and had a different crank than the one pictured it was not possible to lift my car using the crank so i am sending it back,33,14
2081,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,my son used it 3 times to change a flat and 2 rear tires on my 97 ford probe and it worked great a little awkward turning but did the job perfectly otherwise the only kind that fit and was sturdy enough,42,15
2082,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,i like theit work really well i have no complains i paid 19 dollars for this so to me it is a good value,26,16
2083,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,just received this jack went outside and tested it out worked great lifted my 1998 chevy blazer with no problem the jack was able to lift my truck high enough that i could get a jack stand in and change a tire no problem i will be keeping this on board since i do not have the spare tire jack,59,17
2084,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,what a piece of junk do not purchase,8,18
2085,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,looks good hope i do not have to use it,10,19
2354,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,honestly i have nowhat this is supposed to do for my face in the long run i take care of the problem areas of my skin with other products so even if it did some small thing I had never know what i do know is the superfine mist feels awesome when my skin is overheated or tired during the day which will be a lot during the summer the mist is cool and slightly moisturizing without any daily long-term effects like greasiness or astringency I have been using it a couple of weeks and had no breakouts which means it passed a major product test for me in winter i would probably call this more of a luxury than a necessary beauty product but as we go into summer and the hot damaged skin season it seems more like something good to have on hand as a treat,149,0
2355,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i do not see any benefits provided by this spray the stars I am giving are for the great design of the bottle i wish i had a bottle like this for all my sprays it is right between being a mist and a spray so it layers on your skin nicely but I have used this on myself repeatedly now and see no benefits or any kind of difference on my skin i do not recommend it seems like a gimmicky waste of money,80,1
2356,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i do not really get it I have been using this product for a few weeks and I have not noticed any benefit my skin does not feel or look different i can see where a mist would feel refreshing after working out or during the summer i think it is important to moisturize right after washing my face with clean water to help retain the moisture it is also my understanding that under most circumstances minerals and other nutrients work from the inside out not sprayed on top just to evaporate I am not sure what i was expecting with this spray as mentioned this will probably be refreshing on a hot day but I am just not seeing any other benefit,115,2
2357,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,i have a condition called keratosis pilaris on my legs and my face i have tried many products to help with this some work and some do not i have been using this for about a week and i am pretty pleased with the results first of all parts of my face are extremely dry while other parts are somewhat oily i find that this spray works well for my combination skin it feels moisturized but not greasy i wash my face with a charcoal soap then spray this on and allow it to dry naturally and apply my makeup as usual i also use it when i need a refresher midday and before bed i love it,118,3
2358,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,this is a lot like the previous vichy product i tried vichy puret thermale 3-in-1 onemicellar cleansing water but the application process is quite different this is a product you just spray on your face i kept my eyes closed when i did this and tried to keep it out of my hair i left the spray on for a couple of minutes the directions are vague in this regard the product felt a bit sticky as the previous product from vichy did but in this case the directions said to dry my face off after that vague amount of time and that helped with the stickiness the application was a bit off-putting for me i did not feel like it gave me enough control over how much went on my skin and where it went even after using it for two weeks i never felt completely comfortable with it it did not irritate my very sensitive skin and the stickiness was removed with wiping it off but the application oddness and the fact that this product did not do anything to improve my skin means i will not buy it,190,4
2359,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,my wife will not put any chemicals or weird things on her skin she sticks primarily to pure oil products that do not contain things such as alcohol or preservatives she has tried vichy a number of times after bathing and found it pleasant but she feels inconclusive on it is benefits it is always difficult to determine whether certain products are really having a positive effect this would include things such as skin care products vitamins and food supplements it can only be judged on a subjective level which is prone to all kinds of variables unless something has immediately caused a bad reaction or problem tough to tell it seems that there is nothing bad in the vichy which is why she agreed to try it so far she says it is nice,131,5
2360,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,testing this as a free product from the amazon vine program this is a very nice and easy to use product that has become part of the daily routine fine mist spray that moisturizes withour ever feeling greasy or like you are wearing a mudpack so easy to spray and go let it sit for a minute and gently dry time will tell on the results but my skin feels great the research backing up this product seems credible after an internet search,82,6
2361,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,my wife has used this for three days after washing her face she sprayed it on then dabbed it off after it had been on for a few minutes then she said her skin felt soft and smooth the softness she noted lasted all day much longer than when she used lotion unless product is extremely expensive it looks like they have got a steady customer one note my wife does not use makeup we do not know if her highly positive reaction would be less or perhaps even more dramatic weee she one who did,95,7
2362,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,i am familiar with vichy products and have always had a positive experience with products from this brand i was not sure what to expect from a can of expensive water the bar was low for this unfortunately i had a skin reaction to a food allergy and my skin was dry irritated and a bumpy broken out mess having previously dealt with this condition i know that it takes about 2 weeks to completely heal the vichy mineralizing thermal spray water arrived on day 2 of my reaction I have used it daily for the past 5-days and the bumps / irritation has almost completely disappeared the skin that I have used it on is no longer itchy or dry i have no new bumps or dermatitis I am sold on this product,128,8
2363,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i love thismy issue is how it was packaged and arrived the ttem arrived unsealed with a cracked top with a large hole in it the rest of the top is not in the box so it appears it was packaged broken also it feels lighter than 10 oz bottle sounds half full when shaken like it may have been previously used I have ordered a bottle of this previously with no issues it was sealed and the top was unbroken and securely on,85,9
2364,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,1,negative,the product receive is fake not authentic i been using the vichy thermal water in the past and has a different consistency the one receive it just plain water no mineral fake product so disippont,35,10
2365,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,this is a nice mineral water spray it is unique in that it contains salts in amounts you can taste some may not like that but i find it soothing for eczema prone skin,33,11
2366,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,1,negative,i purchased this product in september and by mid-november it was clogged to the point that it would not spray anymore i am very disappointed in the efficiency and usefulness of this container i probably used less than a 1/4th of the bottle,43,12
2367,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,i feel so refreshed after using this spray after using every morning for over a week i could see a difference in my skin much softer and smooth,28,13
2368,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,i guess that i do not have the sophistication to appreciate a 18 can of mineral water that has 101 ounces in it i used this product as directed and nothing it is refreshing to spray on your face when it is clean but i think that i can get the same effect by taking a spray bottle and using some good old american mineral water i am not sure why the french mineral water is so much better than mineral water made any place else but for 25 cents for a 20 ounce bottle compared to 18 i think that i will buy american mineral water i am also a believer that your skin must be hydrated from the inside out you can spray the entire can on your whole body but if you have not put fluids inside your body it is not going to do any good my entire family gets together on the 4th of july for a pool party and i plan to use the vichy spray to keep me cool while I am sitting outside in the heat by the pool and plan to drink lots and lots of water to keep me hydrated,198,14
3020,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,love this phone if only the caller identification would work it worked fine on day 1 day 2 worked on and off day 3 caller identification not working tried moving the phone to different outlets removing the batteries and putting them back in tried new wire and more the phone works great otherwise loved the caller identification when it was working much larger than most and easy to read oh well,67,0
3021,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason and more this is one of the few corded phones with caller identification and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless and more also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house,99,1
3022,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,i love this phone have three of them easy to read simple to use can see caller identification easily have two on desks one on the wall they have worked for 9 months now,34,2
3023,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,after having my old phone for 40 years i bought a new nwb phone due to remodeling it lasted 5 months you can not get through on their help line and they do not answer their e-mail buy a nwb phone at your own risk i had to buy another phone at t and it works fine,54,3
3024,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,it is a good phone that does what i need it to do nothing to fancy but just enough for what i needed,22,4
3025,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,this matches the phone i had on my wall all i had to do was use the same hanging bracket hang the phone and go i did not have to remove wall bracket plaster wall and paint,36,5
3026,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this is a good phone that works well the thing to be aware of is the feature buttons like ringer on are all on top if you put the phone on the wall you can not see the buttons and what they are meant for i use the ringer on / off button a lot and i had to write with a marker on the front of the phone where the ringer button is,71,6
3027,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,to me this phone needs to be off the market i have had more problems with each phone i recieved,20,7
3028,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this is my second easytouch ii i like the easy to read caller identification with option to call back once the identification is in the memory large easy to use buttons and speaker feature so i do not have to pick up the receiver if I am working on my pc,49,8
3029,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,phone did not work at all first of all the seller did not send the ac adapter i had to order it then when it came the phone did not work at all the only thing that worked was the caller identification and that is the only reason why i gave it 1 star,54,9
3030,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,easy to set up and works fine would buy again recommended to several of my friends especially those with hearing problems,22,10
3031,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,i bought this so i could have a hard line for a storm i also bought it for the speaker phone and it is terrible this is a great phone if you do not mind holding it up to your ear but for the speaker phone it is horrible,48,11
3032,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,the product looks ok the buttons are nice and big and easy to read they do not work very well although for example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often i have to press it several times and just right for it to work it does not come with the ac adapter and northwestern bell no longer makes or distributes them without the adapter the lights do not work including the message waiting light it is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter i have tried several stores such as radio shack best buy walmart and target to find an adapter 120vac to 6v 100ma and can not find one i have not been able to find one online either also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 aa batteries it does not this one takes 4 aaa batteries not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me but the description is not accurate for thei am sending it back,187,12
3033,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this phone is very good for the price i bought this phone for someone else this is the 2nd time I have bought this phone the first time i bought this phone it was 3999 in staples everyone should have a corded phone as a back up if the power fails or power failure in your home the manufacture has this phone listed as white but the phone is a beige that is the only fault I have found with this phone,79,13
3034,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this phone has no mute button which made it absolutely useless for the application intended i would not recommend if you need this option otherwise the phone was very nice,30,14
3035,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,phone works fine i like the one touch memory buttons they would be better if there was more room to put name on each button,25,15
3036,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,somehow i had the impression that the phone had a message waiting led indicator but what they do not tell you is that the same led is used to indicate missed calls which to me makes the led totally worthless the phone i had before used the same light but it flashed green for missed calls and flashed red if there was a message waiting this phone makes no distinction between the two i had plugged the phone into a phone line just to see how it operated i never even got so far as to hang the phone on the wall before judging the message waiting issue because for stuffing the phone back into the box,118,16
3037,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,after shopping around for a standard phone with callerid and no answering machine no power outlet nearby i came across this phone that had good ratings and was reasonably priced i like the look and feel of the phone the buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good however when the unit is wall mounted the lcd display is angled down and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it of course that depends on how high your phone jack is and how tall you are i bought two of these phones and both locations i put them were too low to see without crouching down the other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well i do not know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference i could not try that because the unit did not come with an ac adapter plus i have no power outlet close enough to reach so i had to take both phones down and put our 15 year old ones back up,191,17
3038,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,i actually like the phone quite a bit it works pretty well in almost every regard sound quality is very good buttons are easy to find and use and the feature set is pretty good overall a nice phone and a good value however thisis advertised as having 20 number memory which is 10 one touch and 10 two touch i have not been able to get the two touch feature to work i tried calling the customer support number i could never get an answer i was always put on a queue waited for a couple of minutes and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call i left messages and never got a call back i twice tried recalling immediately after getting booted i tried for an hour no joy do not buy northwestern bell phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong,149,18
3039,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,this is a real lemon the volume does not work properly and distorts the sound the touchtone keys stick even although i have had this phone less than 6 months i would like my money back,36,19
3040,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i was ripped off by amazons splitting shipping charges after i had ordered the tiesm as a group i was charged 3 shipping charges for 1 mechanical pencil and 2 orders ofrefills total value of product 1035 total shipping 2003 1 pencil 775 s h 505 190 s h 998 2 leads 170 s h 600 outrageous when i tried to cancel the order after it had been split up i was told it was too late never again,81,0
3041,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,the product was excactly as described the seller shipped the product promptly i would buy this product again and i would buy from this vendor again,26,1
3042,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,thedoes erase well if you use fine quality paper it does not erase well on cheap paper i suggest if you are using these to sketch you use moleskine sketchbooks which use a heavier paper than most brands i use thisa lot and i mean a lot when i sketch it is helpful when i am laying down a foundation for character work in my sketchbook now that i own it i can not see myself not using it i can not believe more brands are not mimicking thislead thing i was able to find blue pentellon another site i wish amazon carried it,110,2
3043,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,theis nice but thedoes not write dark enough nor does it erase easily,16,3

3045,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i was expecting this to be exactly like the blackrefills only in red unfortunately it is not the same quality as the blackrefills and breaks very easily i found the constant breaking frustrating and gave up using it i would not buy this product again,48,5
3046,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i disliked this product because it does not erase completely and it is pointless since i wanted to use this in my math class,22,6
3047,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,received the wrongi received 07 mm instead of 05 mm,10,7
3048,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,the kids were so tickled especially our youngest to get this product they really love theof havingthat is ait works well but the novelty effect for children is even better than the product itself,39,8
3049,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,thisis uselessit snaps way too easily and it is impossible to erase do not waste your money,17,9
3050,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i mean i got what i asked for when i bought red pencili got red pencili did not however expect such weak quality it is difficult to use for what i intended it for I am disappointed i can not apply too much pressure or it will snap which means i do not get as strong aas i was hoping for,62,10
3051,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,easy broken colour is light and broke easily,8,11
3052,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,breaks at any pressure applied to the paper,8,12
3053,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,neatbutis so soft i could not write with it at all it kept breaking thewas not very dark either great service although,26,13
3054,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i write a lot with thisit is impossible it breaks all the time do not waste your time or money if you find a solid 05lead please let me know otherwise you jump to 07 and then 2,42,14
3055,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,no smog on paper note make sure you have a good eraser although or be proficient in an adobe ps,20,15
3056,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,use thiswith my pentel graphgear 1000 drafting pencil to mark up plans,14,16
3057,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i tried thisabout 15 years ago and it was terrible i tried it again recently and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be firstly theis very light inyou can barely see it when writing on white paper it is really more of a light pink than a red as well secondly theis very brittle it breaks constantly even when writing with a light touch i can barely write a few lines without a breakage given this fact i do not think thisis useful for anything more than making check marks on papers i certainly can not do any serious writing with it lastly it feels very strange to write with it granted it is not a graphitethe feel is still unusual like trying to write with something made of wax if thiswere not so brittle and light init might be worthwhile but alas i simply can not use it,170,17
3058,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,just got it today so i decided to try it out first off i bought this to sketch with i see many reviews on this product saying it breaks too easily from what i can tell it does not break that easily as far as the lines on paper i can sort of compare it to colored pencil like but not necessarily overall i like this product and i am very glad i bought it,74,18
3059,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,very cheap breaks easily dony bother putting it in through the tip because it shall peel and erases terribly do not waste your money,22,19
3060,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,it is really nice being able to use a fine point mechanical pencil to mark up blueprints all although they do not erase well at all,25,20
3061,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,breaks constantly so much so that is it not useable,9,21
3062,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,i use them for design drawing markups red-pencils are bolder so i keep those handy these allow me to make finer detailed notations it is true that theis softer than black leads but as long as you are gentle enough they work just fine i put a red-band of fingernail polish on my pencil so that i know which one has the red leads in it,66,22
3063,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,breaks at the slightest pressure poor quality,8,23
3064,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,not brightnot good for writing at all eraser can not remove this pencil so it is pretty much the same as ball-point pen not what i expected,27,24
3065,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,thebreaks very easily however I am able to get a good range of values for sketching and it is really fun to use coloreddefinitely pick it up for the price of it,34,25
3066,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,we use these in our inspection pencils and they are just what you expect,14,26
3067,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,there is no such thing as redour pencilis actually graphite which can not be red sadly as it is a form of carbon cc this is actually very thin wax the same kind found inpencils i love this it pairs off with the 5 steadler pencil i received as a gift nicely it is not too brittle to the point that it breaks on contact you must be soft with it and use many layers one thing i learned is that you should only use about 1 mm or 2 mm ofat a time coming out of the pencil I have attached some photos of my doodles i do at work while combing thiswith graphite and sumi ink respectively,126,27
3068,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,they break fairly easily but that is no indication of poor quality it is just the nature of coloredgo with 07 mm for colored leads it is much more durable,29,28
3069,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,too fragile press hard enough to see the writing and they break,12,29

3072,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,good product but breaks easily going back to regular red pencils,11,32
3073,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,these break if you even look at them,8,33
3074,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,it is cool that it is mechanical and red it makes ticking work easy thebreaks so often although it is barely worth even trying,26,34
3075,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,this is basically just led removed from a colored pencil and coined for writing works very poorly less effective than simply writing with a colored pencil to begin with,29,35
3076,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,i work as an intern for a construction company and to make corrections to drawings we use red pencil and this works perfectly in my pentel 1000 graphgear pencil however if too much force is used while writing thetends to break quite often other than that this stuff works great,52,36
3077,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,theis very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks it is not a dark red and can be hard to see if not using on white paper it does not erase easily but you can erase it if you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light inand fragile than this is your pick i can not really say i have tried others,71,37
3078,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,i homeschool and was going through red pens like mad decided a pencil would be cheaper and work better so ordered these they work fine but the next time I shall probably try to get them for my 09 pencil the 05requires that you write lightly and to get red pencils to really show on students papers you have to press a little harder than normal,67,38
3079,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,this product is exactly what i ordered and it arrived quickly thebreaks easily but is expected out of red 05 mm,23,39
3080,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,thisis very soft and will break on a regular basis theis very light if you try to reduce the amount of pressure you use,28,40
3081,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,like most i wanted to have a second mech pencil with redfor markup i do not know how hard some reviewers stroke is but these work fine for me with no breakage yet even pressing hard however they are more waxy than blackso when pressing hard they do wear quickly and they do erase but not nearly as readily as normal blackas tothese are red not pantone whatever maybe they are a shade of pink but they are red as distinguishable from black which is all i think they are meant to be,101,41
3082,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i am a teacher and was hoping to use these for grading since i prefer writing with a pencil these did not work out at all for me thebreaks every few minutes annoying i will try a thicker gauge,41,42
3083,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i can certainly would like use good colored auto pencils to underline my bible and supplement my drawing pads but i found this redto be a little light when drawing and i had to press harder so i like the concept but please make something with more ease of drawing and deeper,55,43
3084,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,thewas not red but a light pink thewas hard and scratchy i could neot even see the lines unless i used heavy pressure,27,44
3085,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,took kind of a while to arrive it is a fine pentel product some people has complained it breaks easily and it does break easier than regularbut I am sure it is difficult to make coloredas hard as regular i press really hard when i write so i just had to be mindful and it was fine,58,45
3086,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,if you have to red line or correct tests homework or mechanical drawings this is what you want to use it produces a fine accurate line for any 05 mm mechanical pencil once your peers see your handiwork they will all be asking you for a piece of red led for their correcting pencil it can not be erased like a pen so it is pretty much tamper proof red marking,68,46
3087,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i bought the redfor correcting papers but it has proven useless theis very soft and crumbles easily while writing the crumbling is especially a pain when revising papers because i think i tend to press harder while correcting small detailed text features also theis too light and compared to regularthere is no advantage it also does not erase so clearly i wish i had not bought this especially so much of it,79,47
3088,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,thisis very soft if you push out more than a millimeter it breaks i find i can not use thiswithout feeling the metal of the pencil scraping the paper if you advance it any further thebreaks very disappointing product,44,48
3103,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,they look good and they are relatively thick unfortunately they are extremely flimsy further the adhesive squares included for hanging them did not stick to the cork panels unfortunately they did continue sticking to my walls once the cork panels fell off now all i have is a bunch of broken cork panels they broke when they fell and numerous adhesive squares i have to pry / scrape / steam off my wall might have worked better if I had hammered them in place too late now i do not recommend this,86,0
3104,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,when these arrived they were moldy smelling and crumbled apart waste of money,13,1
3105,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,so these get very mixed reviews but there has a simple way to make them great i noticed another reviewer suggested using mod podge to seal them before use do it just get the matte version gloss does not look good and get your own mounting tape what comes with them is not great but the best part of these is the unique look and thickness of the tiles they are much thicker than others i did something a little different after i used the mod podge i drilled into the cork and hung them on door / wreath hangers see picture works fantastic i really really like these tiles,104,2
3106,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,great boards but tape that comes with it does not work well buy your own tape for wall hanging,18,3
3107,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,this product comes with adhesive strips to hold them in place i would have preferred that the adhesive had bee a bit more substantial there was enough double sided tape to put a 1 x 1 patch of tape on each corner more would have been better,47,4
3108,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,redid my wall with these tiles and it looks great the old tiles were falling apart,16,5
3109,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,a lot came damaged or uneven some squares were off almost an inch so they could not be used,18,6
3110,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,the cork in the two different packages did not match and it was impossible to stick this to the wall a disaster,22,7
3111,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,love thebut sticky wall tabs do not keep boards mounted i needed to nail them on,18,8
3112,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,horrible product the first thing i noticed when opening the package was a strong horrible chemical smell i thought it would subside after airing out but after a week it never did the dye on the boards comes off easily and the material is very crumbly,46,9
3113,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,using for bulletin board on the side of my stainless steel frig i had to ditch the magnets works well,20,10
3114,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,we received two sets of these cork boards the second set was clearly a return two of the tiles had stickies on the back making them stick together and break and one actually had a thumb tack stuck in it completely unusable i would like a replacement sent as soon as possible thank you,51,11
3115,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,this board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles 4-pack 82va-4 this corkboard is wonderful i did not use the stickies that came with it i actually attached it to an old window it turned out great you have to use something like scissors to cut it heavy duty ones not a knife or carpet cutter or something like that so i used a pair of tin snips it worked great cut a straight line and the pieces fit neatly into the space of the window panes but the kicker is i used gorilla glue the one where you dampen one of the surfaces i dampened the cork it worked beautifully and now i have a really cool bulletin board for my new office adding to the industrial chic decor already there love love love,139,12
3116,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i love these cork tiles the darklooks great on my light walls and i like how thick they are compared to other corkboards i have tried in the past i put them on the walls around my desk at home to hold pictures / papers i used the enclosed sticky back tabs to put them up in sept 2013 and they are holding strong never had an issue with them coming off i also used an exacto knife to cut them to the size i wanted highly recommend,89,13
3117,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the board did not stick to the tape provided maybe i used the wrong side,15,14
3118,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i really do not like these they crumble and they are all very different tones so they do not create a seamless wall,21,15
3119,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,we ordered a six sets of these for a clients home office and used the sticky foam the came with the items to install we wiped down the wall and then applied the cork to ensure the best stick after being up for just a week the client reported that literally every single piece had fallen down she tried repeatedly to re-stick them and finally used a few heavy duty command strips which finally worked for a few we unfortunately bought these a couple months before installing them and so we can no longer return them I have used these types of cork boards before with little trouble but this was just plain embarrassing we now are having to refund our client and install traditionally framed cork boards instead beware when buying this product that the sticky pads are not great quality and a huge hassle to work what the heck and apparently do not stick to all wall types,156,16
3120,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,very nice i use them on my wall by my desk and on the fridge,15,17
3121,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,when i received the cork squares i mounted them they did not stick well and fell off the surface when i tried to work with them to resecure they fell apart and breaking,32,18
3122,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,cork tiles are great however the sticky tabs do not hold the cork side they stuck to the wall but the cork side is not holding,26,19
3123,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i can see how these could potentially break apart they look pretty fragile but as i was covering these with fabric attached with spray adhesive they are just perfect for my new corkboard i especially love that they are 1/4 inch thick thicker than most cork tiles i found on amazon because most push pins are 1/4 long and i did not want to poke through to the wall,68,20
3124,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,i bought these to cover with fabric when they arrived one was already torn most of the way across they seemed to crumble as i worked with them and there was a big mess on the floor when i was done I have worked with other cork tiles before and did not have this problem,54,21
3125,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,love these i have put them up in my office the best part they smell like smoked brisket laughing out loud,19,22
3126,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,bigger than i expected using to bring more life into a room,12,23
3127,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,they are nice cork boards but have a strong oder to them like liquid smoke i hope it wears off quickly if it does not it will be the first purchase from amazoncom that i throw away three days later and two nights of feeling sick from the oder even after spraying them with a vinegar water mix that was suppose to help i had to throw them away plus i now have to go buy something to repair the wall from hanging them with the stickies they come with what a waste of money bummed,95,24
3128,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,as many of the other recent reviewers stated this is too crumbly to be useful they are also thicker than other cork tiles on this site so i thought furniture tacks would work to put them up but they were too thick i tried nailing them in which is when the office became a gross cork fest waste of money and it is a shame they are really cute in the trash they go,73,25
3129,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these do not stick no matter how many sticky squares i use the boards also crumble easily and they smell bad i wanted to hang these on the inside of my pantry cabinet door and they have been a useless disaster if i had the packaging still I had return them,50,26
3130,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,unfortunately these arrived moldy under the plastic wrapping i had to return them re-purchased a similar product at the hardware store instead which cost me a bit more but they work fine this kind of cork can have a pretty strong smell although be forewarned i kind of like it but not everyone will,54,27
3131,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,they are a greatfor my espresso wood in the office however they are a little messy they leave crumbs if you touch the side i think it is due to how big the pieces of cork are not a huge deal once they are put up if you do not take things on and off much,54,28
3132,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,have not yet put them up but they look like exactly what i wanted,14,29
3133,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,first off i was excited at the possibilities of making my own design on my wall with these cork boards that is where the excitement ended first off they smell terrible I have washed my hands twice after hanging them and my hands still smell bad I am hoping my room does not continue to smell otherwise I am going to have to remove them completely i ordered 2 packages of 4 tiles i could only use 4 tiles as 3 of them broke they are very fragile do not hold them on the corners simple gravity will make them snap in half i accidently broke 2 just by holding them on the corners and their own weight caused them to crumble the other one i held in the middle and it still broke in half they also bring a ton of cork dust when assembling simply put they are very poorly made,148,30
3134,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,love the boards but the stick tabs do not hold these up i had to put nails in each one,20,31
3135,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,we purchased these to protect the wall behind our dart board they work fine for this purpose however if you were going to use for posting things on a bulletin board they may not stand up to everyday use,39,32
3136,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i applied to a regular eggshell paint finish and the tiles fell off of course i did not buy heavy duty tape the whole thing just went straight into the trash and i have some of the tape still stuck on my walls,42,33
3137,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the cork crumbles it is pretty messy does not completely fall apart but chips easily very flimsy too,16,34
3138,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i am making several different things and gluing these to them then using left over to make a cork board,20,35
3139,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,look good but do not stay stuck to wall and crumble apart easy,12,36
3140,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i ordered this product to create usable space on an indoor window not subject to temperature changes the pieces were difficult to make a clean cut even with a new blade in the mat knife and within 48 hours after applying the cork squares they began to fall off of their adhesive attachment tape leaving squares of very difficult to remove white tape a real pain in the at,69,37
3141,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,love the board and the price for the pack but the sticky backs that come with it do not work for beans,21,38
3142,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,did the whole ceiling in my office with these now it looks good smells good and is much quieter,18,39
3143,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,very poor quality and very crumbly we could not use them in our office big disappointment,16,40
3144,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i have to rewrite my review i gave this product more stars in the beginning the sticky pieces wldnt work so i tried gluing the adhesive to the back of the boards i used two sets and put all 8 pieces together within a week the adhesive pieces on the top part of the cork came loose the cork started breaking in half and my childrens artwork fell while i was gone i had caught it a couple times when i was home and was able to stop the cork from breaking those times i wld not recommended this product the cork is not thick enough and even adding 3 m adhesives did not keep it on the wall waste of my money i will have to purchase something else,128,41
3145,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these boards are extremely difficult to hang i have tried several different types of hanging / mounting strips and nothing works in addition the mounting strips have stripped paint off my walls i am not even posting anything heavy just my childs artwork these have created a much bigger headache for me than they were worth,54,42
3146,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,provided tape does not holdto the wall used command strips instead crumbles very easily,16,43
3147,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,terrible cheap and they were all on the floor the next day,12,44
3148,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,poor quality cork board if it is not already broken upon arrival it will be once you try hanging with the adhesive pads that the cork comes right off of walking into my office the morning after hanging them i discovered all but one had peeled away from the supplied adhesive strips the last one was about to fall and two of the other three no had large chunks broken off due to impact with the floor do not waste your time patience or money on this product,86,45
3149,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these are terrible bought them to go behind an electronic dart board game greatbut after putting them up the next day they had all fallen from the wall and broken double-sided tape did not hold up on clean / painted wall also the boards were covered in what appeared to be some sort of white mildew inside the shrink-wrap terrible product do not do it,64,46
3150,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,bought these to go under plants on side tables in order to protect the wood perfect for that purpose thin enough to cut easily and dark enough not to stand out on my dark wood tables,36,47
3151,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i do agree that these are a bit crumbly but if you are careful with them it is not really that big a deal it is simply a side effect of the material they are made of they left a few crumbs out of the package but now that they are on the wall i do not see any problem and they look very rich with the darker colouring as opposed to the usual more bland corkboard squares you can buy i also did not use the adhesive that was in the packet with the squares i used command strips instead both because I am in a rental flat and also because i just wanted to give the cork squares a solid foundation they look great I had buy them again,124,48
3152,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,horrible crumbles with the slightest touch spent nearly 100 for 24 tiles and now have to replace with another product would rate lower if possible,25,49
3153,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,if i could rate these 20 i would i ended up just throwing them away i opened my package and they started falling apart on me i literally had cork all over the place after taking them out of the plastic i did not want something that was going to disintegrate horrible product do not waste your money,56,50
3154,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,these pretty much starting falling apart as soon as i unwrapped them and they left a mess on my kitchen table they are not exactly what i was expecting and probably will not work for what i wanted to use them for which is an aesthetic protective covering for a coffee table i will likely shop around for something mre suitable,59,51
3155,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the cork boards are fine but the tape to attach them was old and dried out,16,52
3156,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,adhesive stuck to the wall just fine but not to the actual cork and they kept falling off the wall and broke into pieces,24,53
3157,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,you are going to need some super glue to really get the stickers to stick to the cork board once you do that these boards will stick to the wall just fine if you do not use glue the double sided tape that comes with it will not stick to the cork board not for long at least,56,54
3158,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,unfortunately these cork tiles crumble at any touch very messy and unable to be used as a bulletin board you only end up with cork dust,26,55
3159,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i was skeptical about ordering these after reading other reviews i should have listened to what i read these are horrible quality just taking them out of the wrapping they completely fell apart i hung a few of the tiles and every time i pin something to them brown cork dust falls everywhere just disgusting and completely not worth the price do not order these,65,56
3160,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,order one batch of 4 like them then ordered 2 more for a total of 12 individual boards the first four were every so slightly lighter than the 2nd batch so i just intermingled them when installing to make it look intentional the 4 pieces of double sided tape enclosed is not close to being enough mounting hardware even the instructions said to use 6 at a minimum i bought some heavy duty double sided mounting tape from big box retailer and used about 20 1 squares of double sided tape per board any less and the board may still stick to the wall but the parts without the tape were loose and easy to bump and break off especially if the boards are actually used and not just on the wall as a decoration the additional tape was especially important since this went behind a dart board so pulling darts out with the minimal mounting tape would likely have left me with many damaged and broken boards the boards themselves are very nice and do look very nice too so it still gets 4 stars for that but loses a star for the lack of proper mounting material,199,57
3161,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,would not recommend right out of the package this was a crumbly mess i wanted that cool look of spacing cork tiles out for pinning and more not the right thing for that i have it stuffed up on a shelf now should probably toss it out before it stays up there for three years getting dusty and making clutter,59,58
3162,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,i ordered the dark cork tiles in two batches they were significantly different inhence they did not match as i expected them to,25,59
3163,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the included double side tapes are not sufficient to make the cork stay on the walls plan on making them stay a different way,24,60
3164,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,fell off wall in less than 2 wks and all the cork chipped at corners the cork is pretty although just does not stick with provided adhesive,26,61
3165,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i bought these for my sons room but i will not use them they are going in the trash when i first opened the package the smell was so strong that i had to leave them in the garage i had hoped that the smell would go away but after a week in our garage they are not much better then on the day they were opened,66,62
3166,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,a little flimsy and crumbly but overall I am satisfied with these lil guys this darker brownwas a little harder to find than the standard cork and the material is a little different too as you can tell from the picture it is not a smooth roll of corkboard or anything it is more like a bunch of little chunks formed together which i think gives it kind of a neat textured look unlike a lot of other ones i looked at these are a nice thickness making them suitable to use alone with push-pins they did make a mess when i put them up and I am not sure how well they would stand up to being taken down and remounted but oh well still worth it oh i also attached them with tiny nails instead of even bothering with the adhesive squares,143,63
3167,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,these squares are a nicesturdy and look nice the major issue is there are not enough adhesive squares included with the package the instructions clearly state that 6 adhesive squares allow for the best bond to the surface but only include enough for four per square sadly i already posted items on the board only to have two of the squares fall off within an hour perhaps if i had enough adhesive squares this would not have happened,79,64
3168,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,good size and easy to work with in terms of application and fit definitely recommend for a variety of crafting projects,21,65
3169,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,most places sell much thinner cork than what i needed this i actually use as protective backing for the wall surrounding a metal tip dartboard works great for that purpose,30,66
3170,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,these boards were easy to put up on the wall with some double sided tape the heavy duty kind so far they are still on the wall the thickness of the boards are perfect for utilizing them as a bulletin board i love theof them too,48,67
3171,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,the board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles are thicker than many of the lighter cork tiles i found in stores the texture andis perfect too,29,68
3172,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,i ordered two packs one arrived crumbling and looked totally different as if it had not been pressed enough i returned it thinking it was a fluke and was quickly shipped a replacement which had two tiles with broken corners i sent them all back they are very nice looking cork boards thick and a nice darkbut go to the store to buy them so you can make sure they are undamaged and all match,77,69
3173,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,the cork certainly looks like it could become crumbly if over-manipulated which makes the fact that they arrived all 4 sheets in perfect condition all the more impressive their corners were squared and no chips or holes i cut them to size with a razor blade and puzzled them together around the bar section of my apartments walls really adds some much needed comfort to these white walls looks professional and fantastic the provided sticky tabs are working for me at the moment but if they do start to slip it is no chore whatsoever to hammer in some little nails the surface is somewhat porous meaning little nails would be completely invisible if positioned tactfully fair value for the buck which is becoming a rarity these days,127,70
3174,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,my daughter and i painted them purple and black and made a decorative bulletin board with them the students love it,21,71
3175,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i used this to fill an old window frame to use as a tack board works greats it does have a tendency to crumble when cutting use a very sharp blade and go slow,33,72
3176,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the product leaves crumbs or bits tends to fall apart the more you use it does not hold push pins well,20,73
3177,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i bought these to maybe use for an earring hanger but I am not positive anymore the four cork tiles are pretty thick and theis nice and dark it is however flaking a bit like piece of the cork are coming off like a lot of pieces they are still intact and will still be usable they are just leaving a trail wherever i take them,66,74
3178,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,this stuff seems to be the right thickness to go behind my dart board and give the sheet rock a rest two packs did the trick three squares above three below and one on either side the mounting system of my bandit dart board still fits perfectly even although the edges of the dart board are over some of the cork it comes with a bunch of double sided tape squares i only used one in each corner just to get the squares set and then used a few finishing nails for more strength all of this and it has a pleasant smokey scent,104,75
3179,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,I am making a largewall in my office and gluing this onto corrugated plastic panels which will be attached to the wall the highly inadequate adhesive squares are completely pointless as i want this stuff to stay attached to the wall for more than a day and the sheetrocked walls in my office have some texture I am using contact cement the edges of these squares are easy to damage and the detritus they she had is non stop i only hope once i have it mounted and framed it with molding it will cease to she had so many cork crumbs i gave it 2 stars because I am committed to finishing my project i do not like it i may hate it in the end and have to revisit and change my review,131,76
3180,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,the product is crumbly but worse all the tiles fell down and no i have sticky double sided tape on my wall i can not get off,26,77
3181,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,it was a little messy as others have said but not overly so i used it on a floor that does not get much traffic a half bath but it was down in a day and looks good I have had it down for about a month and is holding up so far theis great and the thickness is perfect i had little cork pieces everywhere when i cut it but it cut well i thought and a few minutes with a vacuum and voila i like it,89,78
3182,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,glue patches too small tend to stick on wall but not on the more open tile many failed to adhrere,20,79
3183,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i built a picture frame and cut these out and glued them in works great to pin up pictures it looks great and works perfectly,24,80
3184,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i had been searching all over for the correctand density to replace some old broken cork tiles on my daughters cork wall this was an exact match if the previous tiles are any indication of the durability of these tiles they will last quite some time the current ones have been up for i know over 12 years,60,81
3185,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,they do not hang with adhesives provided so i used command strips they are kind of curved but that is only obvious if you hang it curving away from the wall they are very delicate if you drop them they will probably fall into pieces be very careful when handling these on a positive note theis very unique and expensive-looking it adds an artsy element to my room i use it to hang my jewelry and it keeps it very organized I have had them for a few months and so far they are still intact it is a great price so do not expect too much handle with care,107,82
3186,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,these cork tiles are a good thickness but they are very crumbly the consistency of the cork is much looser than that of a typical cork board i would love to find good quality dark cork but this is not it,40,83
3187,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,my delivery never showed up not sure if the company or the mailman is to blame but there is no tracking information available when you purchase this product the seller did resend me the items after i called to follow up about a week later if you need them as soon as possible bewarewas what i expected when it showed up I am liquid nailing them to a chalk board if you are dumb enough to use the double sided tape squares they send you then you deserve to have them fall off your wall the company should not even provide the little squares for this use there has no way they can hold the weight of the cork tile plus whatever you thumbtack to it,121,84
3188,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,i installed these with no problem but then discovered they are too thin for regular pushpins the pushpins only go halfway in so can not tack anything to the nine squares i painstakingly hung up arrrggghh would not recommend just spend the money on a big regular bulletin board i got these from a big box store fyi,57,85
3189,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,these tiles are good quality for the price i would reccomend buying mounting tape to hang them rather than using the mounting squares that come in the package we used the provided squares to start with and most of them fell off the wall the cork tiles are quite thin and several of them broke when they fell after buying a heavier duty mounting tape we were able to create a custome cork border for my daughters room that looks very nice,82,86
3190,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,i put this on a wall do not use the cheap double sided tape spread an even coat of clear silicon on the back and it will be fine,27,87
3191,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,the boards are perfect for my project but the adhesive that comes with them is not great,16,88
3192,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,i bought these to install a wall of cork tile after i did some research on pricier higher-quality cork tiles produced for this type of application i decided did not want to spend the money on the pricier tiles so i opted for these the dark stain makes them look like they are higher-end than the typical square cork tiles you can purchase at the store and they are significantly thicker and sturdier I am very happy with them for the price,78,89
3193,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,yes these are flimsy and crumbly and the adhesives do not hold the damned cork tiles up and they charge and outrageous price for shipping such lightweight materials a real rip off yet i can not find any other dark brown cork tiles out there they all apparently come from the same place and charge high shipping rates someone should manufacture a better product,62,90
3194,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,makes a nice natural looking cork board the board is slightly darker compared to the pictures but has a nice overall tone the only problem with this product is that it is very crumbly and gets everywhere when installing,39,91
3404,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,as the brits say it does what it says on the tin the switches are nice and a cool blue led is included for nights in the forward berth of our boat the solar panel worked flawlessly and installation on our boat was simple i do not have any way of knowing how many cfm of air this thing actually moves but you can at least feel air movement when you have it on blow in mode recommended for an inexpensive ventilation device if you have sun available,88,0
3405,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,this small vent is intended for installation in a small utility trailer although i can not yet report on how it works when installed i found the battery operation of the light fan and directionality of airflow works well no sunlight indoors so do not yet know how the solar works the fan makes minimal noise when the unit is held as it will be when mounted however that disappears to no sound when tilted as little as 5/10 degrees,80,1
3406,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i put two of these on my 45 foot sailboat one set to suck and the other set to blow it was like a vortex of very mildly detectable solar powered tornado wormholes was created running through my boat from front to back it almost caused me to lose control of my helium indoors only r / c zombie shark but luckily i am an excellent air shark pilot and pulled through i am afraid to set them both to suck as it may because my ears to pop or i could pass out as it sucks all the oxygen out of the cabin but i think i can get out sometime in the 3 weeks it would take to do that i do have a scuba tank that should drop from the over head in an emergency air loss just in case i think the head trauma from the last time it deployed changed things in my brain so i kinda keep it taped up there,165,2
3407,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,this vent does not move much air you can barely tell it moves any air not worth the price do not waste your money ricko,21,3
3408,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,got what i ordered it looks good easy to install works fine how long it will last is an open question,21,4
3409,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,nicerealy works maybe a bit weak for an exhaust van but has worked continually for over a month,19,5
3410,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,product seems good although instructions were a bit ambiguous and not yet certain that it does all we hoped,19,6
3411,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,purchased 2 of these fans for a boat in june they look fine and nightlight is a nice feature they are crap do not buy them unless you just want a nice nightlight the fans will not start and operate unless you smack them even in bright sunlight so you become the switch they have a one year warranty so we will see how that goes,64,7
3412,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,it was great while it worked worked for 1 year and now it will only run on battery solar part does not work,22,8
3413,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,does not do much very little air is moved,8,9
3414,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,unfortunately this product did not hold up as advertised we are looking for something to replace it to fit in the hole that has been cut into our outbuilding any more damage would be bad,36,10
3415,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,do not expect a crazy difference but it does the job it works the light looks cool in our camper van and actually helps our vision at night again it is a small vent do not expect big vent differences in temperature I am happy with this product sawed a hole in roof of fiberglass went right in with some caulk vent is a tid bit noisy again to be expected it really does change the temperature i can feel it if i move my hand under it and the other on the other side that is not insulated and without a vent about 10 - 20 degrees difference consider the price of purchasing the saw hole component when you purchase this i think mine was about 40 at home depot,125,11
3416,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works great for my outdoor she would just the right size and easy to install,14,12
3417,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,thisstopped working after about 3 days,8,13
3418,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,I am not sure if the fan is supposed to spin both ways but mine will only suck air in it will not blow air out which is really what i wanted,31,14
3419,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,lasted 1 year all rusted the circuit board is poorly made and fragile would not recommend this vent,18,15
3420,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,update will not work anymore it has been few months now and every time i go to the boat it is not running few hits and it starts but stops again so need to remove it and thrown away,37,16
3421,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,installed this solar vent in the front hatch of my sail boat about 4 weeks ago it is working as advertised no issues with leaks in normal weather conditions have not tested it in green water conditions although,37,17
3422,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,better battery would make this a 5 star,9,18
3423,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it is ok for a tiny room tiny tiny room,9,19
3424,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it was noisy and only lasted six months not worth the postage spent on it,15,20
3425,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,not worth the money as it moved literally no air that i could sense,14,21
3426,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so i returned it for my money back otherwise it worked and looked nice if it were not for a bedroom application i would probably have kept it,41,22
3427,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,so far so good works as advertised after 3 months the light is a nice added feature,17,23
3428,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,well built and fairly nice to look at airflow is lower than hoped but adequate,15,24
3429,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,terrible lasted one month what a rip off,8,25
3430,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,do not buy this airflow is minimal and hardly worth the trouble it just does not have enough power,17,26
3431,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,good vent i wish it had a way of closing when i turn the vent off installation directions are very general so take your time and think it through if you not at handy person,35,27
3432,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,installed it and met my expectations it does not move a great air volume but is the same with any other solar vent pros you can invert air direccion in / out works at night by means of a rechargable bat and has a cortesy light cons does not move large air volume,49,28
3433,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,i put the su force in my small greenhouse nice features not as much airflow as i expected then it quit working after a couple of weeks i have not had time to try customer service so hopefully they will make it right,42,29
3434,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,i bought three of these to put in my rv they stay on all night running on the internal battery they are very quiet but they do not pull / push too much air,30,30
3435,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,works great is good quality and i like the features however the fan power is a bit weak if you have a small greenhouse it works fine but not for any house over 6 x 8,36,31
3436,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,high quality although full engineering i use it on my salt water coastal cruiser there is never too much ventilization in aboat,22,32
3437,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,using it in she had that is being built will not know till i experience it,15,33
3438,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,works once in a while when it feels like it too many switches confusing design blue light is inadequate and when the fan decides to come on it hardly moves any air at all,34,34
3439,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,i did not like them they are not stainless steel plus the inside is made of very chip plastic i guess i got what i paid for,26,35
3440,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,this works awesome in my vehicle never leaked once properly installed even driving 65 mph on the freeway in a driving rain,21,36
3441,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,used in an 8x12 storage she had to keep humidity under control it is not going to win any prizes for air movement but it vents enough to do the job during the summer looks better than most options,37,37
3442,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,i would like to have it in place a while before i pass judgement the last one different mfg let me down after about a year,26,38
3443,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i live aboard a 40 feet sailboat and these vents supply me with outside air when conditions dictate all of my hatches need to be closed the addition of the lightng feature is the future will prove a plus it is surprising how much light is put out,48,39
3444,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,looks good and runs fine so far no more condensing on the boat interior instructions are poor on setting switches for anyone installing them the reason they say 4 1/2 inch hole is that 4 1/4 is to small it is not a tight fit in the 4 1/2 hole leaves room for doing an epoxy coating onor hatch coring,62,40
3445,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it does not work plain and simple instructions are pretty much useless and there is no way to mount this without taking the cover off and drilling your own holes,30,41
3446,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works great for venting rvs that sit out in the hot sun,12,42
3447,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,noisy but circulates as long as the sun is shining on it,12,43
3448,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i installed this myself and it works great,8,44
3449,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,very low flow but does the job i used it to vent an outhouse stink pipe and it works good battery does not make it through the night but it is mostly needed for hot days,34,45
3450,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,cheaply made does not seem to have much airflow do not know what it was meant to ventilate certainly nothing larger than a shorbox,22,46
3451,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works well clean and easy to use and install started up right away we are using it to vent a greenhouse,21,47
3452,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,I am still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so i can not vouch for their efficiency but i wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is not 45 or 5 as stated in various comments here the instructions that come with the fan say cut a 45 diameter hole using the template provided the template measures 425 not 45 i cut a test 425 hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat so do not order that 45 hole saw and mandrel for 50 i used a 7 adjustable circle cutter that i got at harbor freight it worked fine i am replacing the plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so i have the luxury of doing this work in my shop the only other comment that i have about the fan is that the ss cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates i have quite a condensation problem in my boat so i am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust I shall keep you posted,201,48
3453,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,this solar vent was very easy to install and can potentially replace one meant for a 35 hole on my boat this replaced a 45 vent leaving a little bit of abut there is a beauty ring included that hides any size difference quite well the light is not enough to read by but will help you see the other switches in the dark the fan direction can be changed and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night it looks great easy to install I am very happy with it so far it was 3 times cheaper than those available at west marine so time will tell how well this truly holds up in a marine environment,130,49
3454,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,these are great low profile and work just fine my issue is this the exterior screws are rusting after only a week outside i doubt they will last very long the worse part the rusty water is leaving rusty streaks on my sailboatsruining my gelcoat and causing expensive damage to the paint i dunno what to do update today about one year later they broke seems they are not as waterproof as i had thought,77,50
3455,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i used in in mobile storage transport trailers does good job of keeping humidity in control hawaii 80 no mildew since installed,23,51
3456,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,to slow battery did not charge well instruction not clear it can be good for someone but not for me,20,52
3457,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,bought this sunforce stainless steel solar vent for my new vinyl storage she had to be cooler inside i think it would be a better unit if the electric fan in it ran faster i felt outside just under it and it does move some air just not enough i guess well built and durable housing also,56,53
3458,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,right out of the box it was slow to operate and you could see that the fan was not running true it wobbled and made a slight rubbing sound within a month it quit working due to a broken wire from the motor looking for a less expensive to the nicro i guess you get what you pay for,59,54
3459,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,the sunforce 81300 stainless steel solar vent appears to work as advertised helps to lower temp in rv in hot weather and circulate air when rv is not occupied without having to plug rv to power sold by amazon with free shipping at b000bynglu,46,55
3460,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,we are using this in a small hothouse and it works just great it was easy to install and seems to have reduced mid day temperatures significantly been working for about 3 months with no apparent problems,37,56
3461,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,this solar vent stopped working within six months of installing it and being after june 2012 amazon will only give me a partial credit and i pay for shipping and sunforce can not even return my phone calls or emails do not waste your money and now i have a hole in my she had,53,57
3462,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,short and sweet works great in my small greenhouse looks expensive i would buy this again if i ever need one,21,58
3463,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i thought it was a bit pricy but the thing does work the light works as well this is not a tornado fan but is a small solar fan which we will use to move air through our cargo trailer,40,59
3493,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
3494,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,these work great holding not only the hose end of my high-powered dryer for the corgis but can also support the weight of a hand-held dryer for our papillon the clamps are very stiff and if you have any problems with lack of hand strength this product will be a challenge to use,53,1
3495,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,the clamp is strong i need 2 hands to clamp it down the black little plastic covers at the clamp tips slide off easy i suppose one could glue them back into place with some glue-epoxy just have not gone through the trouble of doing that yet for at home use it works fine anything fancier and you are in the professional grooming business i suppose like an extendable flex arm which rotates on / from your ceiling around the dog d have not used it but a few times,86,2
3496,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,I have used thisonce and so far I am loving it my american cocker puppy squirms a bit when she has on the grooming table after getting her bath the groomers third arm allows me to keep both hands on her while still being able to dry her off cuts my time in half very sturdy well made product,58,3
3497,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does my only minor complaints might be that for a woman the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality you should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps will not completely protect theof the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table i would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on overall a good quality product,110,4
3498,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
3499,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,i actually returned this grooming arm it was not strong enough to hold the hose,14,6
3500,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,too hard to open clamp does not really work well too heavy,11,7
3501,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,love this for my hand held hair dryer much better than holding under my chin for fluff drying,18,8
3502,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,very sturdy but the plastic covers on the clamps are cheap thin and fall off easily when the clamps are opened i have secured mine with electrical tape,28,9
3503,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i work as a dog bather and do a lot of force drying some of my larger project dogs have been difficult to dry taking about a half hour with a reducer cone and two motors going it was a lot of hair i bought this to stretch dry some of my hairier clients to really fluff them up for a groom the first day i attached it to my table it got used on a matted doodle and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat the doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker so did that golden it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile if you are thinking of buying a stretch dryer or a big stand dryer try this first i was ready to spend 200 on a stand dryer when this 40 tool fixed all my problems,177,10
3504,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,works great my only complaint is i can not take the hose off the clamp and put it back by myself,20,11
3505,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
3506,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this product does what it says it will do free up one hand so you can dry and brush the dog at the same time my only concern was that it was very hard to squeeze the clamp to attach it to the table,45,13
3507,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,exactly what it says it is very pleased,8,14
3508,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,exactly what i needed to help me dry my old english sheepdogs i tried to fashion one of these for myself and it was an epic fail this one works perfectly,31,15
3509,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
3510,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,works perfect now i can keep both my has on my dogs / cats,12,17
3511,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,i use this to hold a shower head to wash my dogs in the sink in the laundry room it gets rusty after 6 month because of the splash of water so i just bought a new one photo attached,40,18
3512,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,wanted to like it i could not squeeze the handles when i was able too clamp it on it would pop off,22,19
3513,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,it is ok it holds the dryer hose well but the extension is not long enough to clap onto theof a table and dry pets from the top down which is important when grooming yorkies cresties and shihtzus this is not a must havebut it serves it is purpose well,50,20
3514,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,this thing was in my cart for a very long time i thought it was too pricey for what it was and was looking for cheaper things to use i ended up buying a cell phone clamp which worked great for my metro quick-draw force dryer but when i bought the big-daddy metro force dryer it would not hold the heavier hose i finally bit the bullet and bought it and it makes my home grooming so much easier it is very study but forgiving when moving it i usually take the nozzle off my hose and turn it all the way down so i can use it as a fluff dryer love the size too mine came all black which i like better than the orange,126,21
3515,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,clamps are too hard to open mine broke off where the clamp piece meets the flex pipe after only a year,21,22
3516,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,works protective rubber tips come off and tear very easily,10,23
3517,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,it does not fit the hose with an attachment on it and the clamps are so stiff i can barely get it on the end of the hose without the attachment,30,24
3518,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,very difficult to position and to squeeze the grips do not use on plastic,15,25
3519,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,strong grip bend to where you want it holds in place,11,26
3520,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,is there a softer version of this very handy tool i can not even press the clips open enough to clip onto my grooming table and yes i do open my own pickle jars the clip on the other end is also so strong that i fear it will crush the hard plastic at the end of my dryer hose i would recommend this product only to the incredible hulk,69,27
3521,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,this did not hold up my nozzle to my dryer at all,13,28
3522,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,my wife wanted a hands-free hairdryer holder and this fit the bill perfectly i mounted this to a cabinet door in the toilet area next to my wifes sink it is been hanging there for a few months and has not fallen yet despite a few head bumps on my part,49,29
3523,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the clamps take super strength to open i could not do it donated to goodwill,15,30
3524,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the arm did not attach tightly to the table moved around and the arm was so stiff it took two hans to adjust,23,31
3525,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,this is a very bad design i am going to return mine,12,32
3526,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,need strength in your hands to work these clips but once attached great,15,33
3527,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,excellent sturdy and able to hold the weight of a hand drier also only problem is needing to have strong hands to open and shut the clamp but then if it were not tight it would let slip the thing it is holding would not it,43,34
3528,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,too hard to open much too strong a grip i do not bother using it at all because it is so difficult to use and i am not a weakling,29,35
3529,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,this is great frees up both hands for combing / brushing,9,36
3530,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,received as advertised works great great packaging fully recommended seller,10,37
3531,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,this thing is poor quality for the price the reviewer that said replace the rubber tips withtape was spot on as soon as i tried to use the clamp the rubber tips slide off and cracked junk the arm itself is weak the weight of my dryer makes it drop down so i had to mount it high and place dryer on the bottom so gravity would help position instead of fight it i paid 32 at 15 it would have been worth the price at 32 it is not a good deal,95,38
3532,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,too hard to to bend or open the clamps men probably can do it but i could not,17,39
3533,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the clamps do not want to stay clamped to anything and if you do get it to stay put as soon as you move the arm the clamp let us go,29,40
3534,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,it is very nice and really helps to dry the coat of show dogs there is one small issue however it takes awhile to loosen the clamps and until that happens it is really difficult for me to open the clamps wide enough to use but then I had rather have it this way than the reverse such that the clamps open easily upon first purchase and then become too loose after use all and all a good buy,76,41
3535,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the clamp on the bottom of the table does not hold tight you may turn the flexible arm upside down and use the other end of the clamp and it will do the same it is not tight enough for when you move the dryer hose around there has constant fixing and adjusting something that you do not you should not be doing when a dog in on the table,66,42
3536,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the rubber clips always slip off the arm can not hold up the weight of a human hairdryer clamps are very stiff,21,43
3537,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this is great for what it is suppose to do but the clamps are really hard to open and after being clamped on the table for a while it left a mark but it is worth it if slight damage to your table is not a big issue also my table has a vinyl coat on the top so it is easy to damage it with something like this the coil part is easy to maneuver and the clamps swivel making it pretty simple to get it right where you want it,90,44
3538,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
3539,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,i do love this product and it is very helpful but i do not use it as often as i thought i would still it does the job,26,46
3540,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,grooming my 3 yorkies takes time this dryer surely cuts that time in half only drawback is the really hard spring in the clip almost have to use two hands to get it open enough to clamp on the table other than that it is a great deal,47,47
3541,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,not flexible am unable to aim the dryer end where i need it to be the grip is too tight I am afraid it will break my dryer hose end,29,48
3542,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i actually used this arm to mount a video baby monitor near the crib to get the best vantage point without hanging over the crib itself this arm worked very well each clamp is strong and stays in place i was even able to temporarily unscrew one clamp to cover the arm with a baby mobile arm cover to match the room decor the arm itself positions well and is stiff enough to stay where you set it just what i needed,82,49
3543,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,the arm is so stiff it is impossible to move it around to dry different areas of the dog if you just want one to stay in one spot it is great if you want to dry the whole dog it is a huge disappointment,44,50
3544,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,it does a great job i do not have a problem with it at allit is easy to mount and i can angle it just where i need it my hands are free to do the dogs thanks so much,40,51
3545,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,saved me a fortune as i use my blow dryer with this instead of the expensive forced air dryer and since i have show quality persians and exotic shorthairs to groom daily i am totally satisfied fits perfect on any and all my grooming tables or counter tops,48,52
3546,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,it is too hard to open and grab the blower it can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently but not to travel as i needed,30,53
3547,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
3548,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies other than really is working,24,55
3549,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,this is a simple product and it does what it says it does my biggest complaints is that for a me the clamps are very hard to squeeze open anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps the other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time i used them overall a very good quality product the product has been great for me,78,56
3550,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,thisworked as discribed and was a life saver in my work with the dogs i have to groom it is everything it claims to be in it is advertisement and a definite must for all groomers who have more then 4 pets a day to wash and groom,48,57
3551,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,i bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs it does not really work and i have not been able to sucessfully use it yet and I have had it for about 2 months it will not stay in place the clamps just slide around on the counter maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that was not smooth the clamps are really hard to get open so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job on the bright side i can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose,100,58
3552,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the basicof this grooming arm is good but what you will not realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate the clips are extremely difficult to open in fact they are impossible for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands it was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room unused,83,59
3553,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,does what it is supposed to do but expect the black plastic endcaps to come off the first time you use it i intend to use some epoxy to glue them on permanently this is the only issue that kept me from giving the device a 5-star rating,46,60
3554,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i mean who could not use a third arm when trying to dry a dog this product is perfect for freeing up your hands and your concentration when drying your pet it is well-made with heavy bolts and clamps it is flexible yet it stays in the position you set it to get your work done each grip comes with holes on both sides which allow you to bolt this product to your grooming table you will want to do that otherwise you will not enjoy it is full benefit meaning you will have to use two hands to reset the grip if you need to adjust it during a drying session nuts screws and washers for securing it to your work station are not included in the packaging it would be nice although if they were,131,61
3555,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
3556,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
3557,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5,positive,i used this with a blow dryer on my grooming table to finish the head and face of my dogs i was afraid it might not support the weight of the dryer but it is not even an issue no matter where i position it or twist it it holds it wherever i place it i did not have the money for a conventional stand dryer but i think I shall be just find as long as i have the third arm,80,64
3558,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1,negative,i purchased third arm mainly so that i can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat totally what it is intended and designed to do for me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top i needed to use two arms than i clamped the blow dryer to the top arm but than when i had a wet cat ready to blow dry i could not move the third arm i tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off eventually i was able to screw it back on after i blew dry my cat without third arm but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod hitting on impact me my cat and the mirror in front really useless if you use metro dryer the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod it is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder i could do without,190,65
4027,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,i do not like the look feel or fit of these grips the size fits my hand a bit better than my hard rubber hogue grips but does not feel as comfortable and does not look as good also the fit on the gun is just a bit off enough to make it look a bit cheap,55,0
4028,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,i purchased pachmayr grips for my ruger super blackhawk many years ago and they are great expecting the same qualitly i purchased the grips for my ruger redhawk and was very disappointed they do not fit good and the grip screw nut was loose in the grip and just turns round making it hard to get the screw out when i got the screw out the nut fell out in my hand the grips are loose very narrow and do not fit my hand at all now i know that no one set of grips can fit everyone is hand but these are very awkward and i am going to return them,109,1
4029,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,i ordered pistol grips for my s w bodyguard model 49 and they sent me grips for a rugar redhawk 44 mag i have tried numerous times to contact the company to exchange for the proper gribs and they never got back to me i also attempted to call them but you only get an answering machine i left several messages and they never returned a call i would not recommend this company to anybody I am not trying to get my money back just the correcti ordered,88,2
4030,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,these are the only choice for my ruger redhawk with high powered ammo the reduced recoil felt makes them the best choice for me shipping and service from leavitt enterprises the amazon supplier was exceptional,35,3
4031,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,these grips are just sad they do not meet up properly along the seem and are so soft that the hammer pin works it is way free with only five pulls of the trigger if you have hand like brock lessner then they may fit your hand i have large hands and they are just to big and poorly designed bottom line is to save your mony and bye the houge tamer there just better in every way,76,4
4032,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1,negative,grip has 1/2 inon front of frame,9,5
4033,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,not very well made did not fit very well has gaps at the front part of the grip,18,6
4034,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,only shot five rounds with the new grip and found it just super the initial shock was completely absorbed and i had just the regular kick back now i can not wait to really burn some powder with it,38,7
4035,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,i like these better than the hogue grips i have both for the same 44 magnum shooting heavy 44 loads is tolerable now,23,8
4036,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,perfect fit painless install and very comfortable grip,8,9
4037,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,four stars for design but only rated two stars because of the poor quality of the product this grip fits my hand better than the hogue grip but the hogue quality is much better i like that this grip has a very thin cover of the back strap but when installed the front of the grip along the finger grooves does not meet this leaves athat runs the entire length of the grip,75,10
4038,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2,negative,this pair of grips did not fit my redhawk correctly there was a pronouncedalong the front where the two halves meet,23,11
4039,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5,positive,i bought three different grips before i found this one this is the one that takes the bite out of the recoil it has a thin layer that covers the metal strip on the back of the handle it is what is needed to keep it recoil shock from resignating through your arm makes the redhawk feel like a super redhawk,62,12
4040,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,4,positive,i can not give firsthand advice about this my brother needed it and is very happy with the purchase i do not even really know what it is,26,13

4215,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,just what i expected and need for my purposes had some years ago from w-mart but these are much better quality,21,1
4216,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,i bought these under the pretense that they were cheap and i could install them in a few seconds before my trips to the woods worst decision i ever made with 15 not only are they flimbsy terribly made but not a single gun out of my collection will fit in these things the diameter of the hooks is only about 1 1/2 icnhes wide no shotgun or any ar or carbine style rifle will fit only my rem 700 would fit but the scope rubbed on the roof and it would not fit in the bottom so it was out of the question as well only a pellet gun also the bottom hooks are so close to the top hooks that not even a pellet gun will fit inside i only recommend if you wanted to spend a solid hour dremel in hand as i did increasing the diameter and cutting an inch of the bottom hooks other than that do not buy go with the roof rack or a seat hanging bag just as long as you do not go with these,181,2
4217,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,i have a rv travel trailer with a full pass thru with a door on each side inside the space on one side the panel is braced with 1x1 boards on the top and bottom these fit right into those grooves no drilling no glue or any sticky attachments intalled in minutes protects my fishing rods from bouncing around or getting damaged by other items in the cargo area during transport i recommend for added protection you use a velcro strap around each end for added stability to make sure the rod stays put and just prevents the rod from bouncing out of the rack this product is made in the united states and that is why i bought it,118,3
4218,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,the easiest rack ever no need for tools no damage to vehicle installs so easy it can be installed removed and reinstalled again at anytime umbrellas canes fishing poles or guns just a great rack,35,4

4221,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,the minimum setting describes the window application when in actuality the smallest thisgets is about 11 inches did not work for where i wanted to use it because of this but re-purposed it elsewhere,36,7
4222,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,only problem is the fact that it is difficult to get it tight enough not to slide,17,8
4223,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,these things are junk i would not trust hanging an umbrella in them i bought them as a joke for a liberal friend,22,9
4224,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,the primary purpose that i am using thisis to hold my umbrella in my truck this is a handy device and since i also place my rifles in the top when i go hunting or to the range it is a preface multitaskedto hold umbrellas as well,51,10
4225,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,works great i use these for a shovel and axe in the rear side window in my jeep cherokee xj,20,11
4226,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,would give it 5 stars if it had come with a picture or drawing on installation had to use a puddy knife to loosen up trim around window to get a snug fit but once adjusted it holds firmly using it to hold my fishing poles in my truck and it works great,53,12
4227,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,i changed out the hardware that came with it other than that these are perfect and hold a lot of weight,21,13
4228,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,i got these to put in the back window of my pickup they are pretty flimsy and it seemed like no matter what i did i could not get them to stay in place i wanted to be able to set my m1a in these but the hooks were not wide enough for her i know that an m1a is a bit bigger of a rifle than most a mans gun if you will but these hooks were a solid 3/4 too narrow i may end up drilling and tapping the metal near the window and running a screw through these i might also just not worry about it and just mount these in the workshop to keep the guns I am working on off of the desk if you are just going to put small rifles or ones that you will not mind falling then these are decent if not i would recommend getting some more serious gun racks,154,14
4229,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,fits very good in my truck very happy,8,15
4230,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,product works fine with sliding back window you have to tuck it between the rubber and not in the track for the glass seems a little flimsy but for the price it works great it has rubber where the gun lays so it will not scratch it,46,16

4232,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,two stars thedescription and depiction is fairly accurate but the mechanism for securely holding position is more flimsy than it appears these racks were consistently being knocked out of place by even the most gentle jostling in the truck add to that the fact that they do not accommodate side-by-side shotguns nor most of the stocks on my guns and i just could not keep these around,67,18
4233,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,does not secure well and obstructs how far back seat can do back,13,19

4245,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,these are made like the old ones were except for the fact that the ends that fit in the windows are plastic and not metal like the old ones were they are exactly what we needed to put in our truck to attach our fishing poles on and have them ready to use when we go out and about like we do in the spring very goodwill probably hold up well because the sun will not get to them because our windows are tinted,85,31

4273,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,i was very disappointed with this gun rack i only use it to hold my sons hockey sticks in the back of my truck even with the lightweight it still pulls away from the back and is constantly falling spend a few extra dollars and buy a better gun rack,50,59
4274,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,nice product and thanks for delivery on time,8,60
4275,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,good for square body chevy trucks with sliding windows as the window is too short for many metal gun racks without drilling the rack works and looks good stronger than you would expect holds two shotguns without bending personally i like the plastic racks if you are worried about getting the finish on your rifle or shotgun scratched i highly recommend this rack it is plastic so if the rubber wears off it will not scrape off blueing made in united states which is a nice plus the plastic racks were popular in the 80s on chevy trucks does the job well for those who want old school without drilling this is the rack for you do not toss em behind the seat when you can keep them nice and clean on a rack,130,61
4276,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,they are exactly as advertised fit great delivered on time,10,62

4278,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,my husband needed these to store rolled plans in the rear of his pick-up and they work like a charm for that purpose keeps the plans neatly rolled up and out of the way easily installed,36,64

4286,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,not very well designed guns keep falling and it does not adjust to where two guns can be held in my chevy silverado extended cab the head rest are in the way,31,72
4287,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,perfect just what i was expecting and a good value i use mine in a farm truck and keep a 22 and 12 gauge in it they stay put on some fairly rough terrain yet easy to get gun out when needed,42,73

4290,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,it works but not reliable i would not buy this again,11,76
4291,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,these are pretty flimsy you get what you pay for i guess we had to modify them otherwise the guns rattled and the pieces of the rack slid as we drove,30,77
4292,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,no good do not stay on window slip off,8,78
4293,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,it is a pain in the ass to put my hunting rifle on and two guns is to much weight it will shift,21,79
4294,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,these are alright and function but extremely cheap also all i can fit in it is a rifle and that is because the barrel is small my 12 gauge is too fat to fit inside good price but you get exactly what you pay for,44,80
4295,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,kinda hard to get a good tension on it to keep it in place,14,81
4296,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,you have to use wooden shims for the back window of a f-250 ford pickup and that is with the divided back window that has slots you can fit the rack footing into even then both assemblies are wobbly because of the plastic construction i do not know if you can use this rack with the factory installed back window and there are no installation instructions to help you with any work around substandard all round even for the price i would not bother even trying this one to see if it might work for nine bucks it will not,97,82
4297,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,they worked in the pics and looked good in the package but guess they are not ment to hold real guns i bought two sets one broke in 3 days the other warped from heat they are now in the local dump,42,83
4298,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,buyer be warned this fits very few windows does not work in a chevy colorado gmc canyon double-check the measurements against your window space before purchase,25,84
4299,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,great fit and form realy like it and it will hold a rifle or two but not my sharps rifle just to heavy for it thanks for a great prod,30,85
4300,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,they wiggle loose and fall out from vibration of vehicle had a gun fall out of the window and behind the seat,22,86
4301,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,these are cheap was not expecting much but was still disappointed impossible to get tight enough to stay snug even when i did the would not fit any of my rifles do not waste your time,33,87
4302,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2,negative,i actually bought the rack to hold a couple of drivers golf and they did not fit my back window the bottom holder was to low head rests and the top holder was to high,35,88
4303,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,they work ok but no matter how much you push and make them tight they will still move around the will tilt as you hang items on them some times when placing a gun on it one may completely come out also the adjustment is only to the distance from the top holder to the roof so you can not adjust the distance from the bottom nor can you adjust between the j holders foget about using the bottom holders if your seats have any type of head rest too they maybe ok if your using it for an 80s truck or older or maybe on the back side glass of a suburban,112,89
4304,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,fits well is out of the way and so far have not had a problem with it installation was a little tricky at first but once i found a good spot to hold it seems sturdy,35,90
4305,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,these little gadgets are great take your guns hunting and tell any would be truck thief that you are armed and it is probably a betterto go steal someone elses truck maybe a liberal,35,91
4306,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,pro if it fits your truck you could probably carry fishing rods without it breaking con way too small to fit f-250 rear window flimsy never imagined that this would not fit a standard pickup with a slider window also never imagined that anyone would sell something that even if it did fit is not fit for purpose caveat emptor agrum non emi quisquilias identification est do not buy this trash,72,92
4307,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1,negative,this is a piece of crap good thing it only cost me 1700 because it is not worth any more this thing will not stay put in the window and i ended up throwing it away,36,93
4308,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,i now have these in both sides of my astro van i need another set for my truck hu what,20,94
4309,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,it took several tries before i realized the ends really needed to be pushed hard behind the back glass trim i am not sure i would even have tried to push them that hard if i had a new truck but in the old work truck i was willing to risk it i should also say that i use these for carrying plans and a 4 level both of which are lighter than a rifle or shotgun but i would hazard the guess that it sould support a firearm with no problem,92,95
4310,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,i have owned one of these before and i liked it alot especially made in united states it arrived on time but it was missing a carriage bolt and a wing nut hhhmmm i went to value home centers to pick that up other than that i would still buy another,47,96
4311,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,i bought this to install in my f150 supper cab i have the sliding glass rear window i carry a 30 - 30 lever with 40 mm scope and 22lr lever iron sights and everything fits fine really happy with this rack i do not know that i would trust it to hold both guns while driving off road but for on road seems to work just fine,64,97
4312,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4,positive,this keeps my fishing poles inside when i travel i used to keep them on the roof too bad my two rifles would not fit very handy when space is limited,30,98
4313,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,as described they worked well in my 1989 chevy truck pleased with the price i use them for fishing poles,20,99
4314,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5,positive,it is obviously plastic but it works great and is strong slap it in and put your guns up five stars in my book,23,100
4488,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,the game consists of about 40 stages as far as I am aware starts off fairly easy and picks up in difficulty as you progress it can get a bit repetitive at times however since you can use different units in different ways to take our your targets it keeps it to a minimum for the most part you will also probably want to repeat stages so you can gather items to equip your minions with more powerful equipment pretty fun I had definitely recommend it,83,0
4489,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,not sure why there are a lot of hateful reviews here but I am really enjoying this game the soundtrack and sound are great and the gameplay is really addictive and very similar to that of pikmin it is even created by the same team upgrading your units is fun and keeps me coming back i have not beaten it yet but I have put a few hours in and I am sure it will be expanded even further with dlc in the future also multiplayer the worlds look great but the actual characters are a little lacking in detail compared to other vita games but the gameplay is fast and fluid and that is what matters most to me i picked this game up for 30 on a lightning deal and i think that is the sweet spot for it,134,1
4490,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,this game is ok for the first half but then the areas get cheap there are electric fences and fire traps that are almost impossible to avoid the games difficulty does not increase due to a need for the players skill to increase but rather the game introduces cheaper tricks and tactics in each new level and due to limited control of your army the game becomes very frustrating i do not recommend this game instead invest your money in one of the other excellent launch titles like uncharted rayman mutant blobs attack or escape plan,95,2
4491,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,a great game to play on the vita one of best stragey game i played I am glad i got it for my vita,23,3
4492,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,i purchased this game when i preordered my ps vita i should have waited this game minus well be an app for a smart phone a free one at that i believe it is a great concept yet nothing else went into this game you have minimal control it is basically a one button does all action game except for movement i assure you you will be disappointed with it luckily the gamestop i purchased it at let me return it for a preorder of unit 13 so far I have been extremely happy with my vita and all the games i have uncharted wipe-out ninja gaiden and dungeon hunter this game was an extreme disappointment if you are planning on purchasing it wait til it goes down in price I am sure you will easily be able to get a pre-owned version any day now i believe most people who made the mistake i did of purchasing it will be trading it in very soon if they are not able to return it ultimately it is your decision although i believe the majority of ps vita owners will have serious buyers remorse,192,4
4493,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,each levels kind of repetitive but it is an awesome game good to plan a pinch when you do not have much time to play through a whole game,27,5
4494,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,nice little addition specially since it does not take up precious space in the memory card,15,6
4495,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,garbage waste of money graphics are so sloppy controls are terrible gameplay is not fun characters are so small on the screen everything blurs together,25,7
4496,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,i loved it i got it very quicky and it was great the music is amazing and the game is fun,21,8
4497,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,do not waste your money this game is absolutely terrible my understanding is that the game makers are struggling to come out with games that can be played on the vita but this is a game that could have been skipped in the development process the graphics are ok the controls are easy the concept is cheesy,57,9
4498,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,this game is for no reason bad but it is not the best of it is kind either if your really want this type of game play play the pikmin series score6/10 mediocre,31,10
4499,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,i got this on the cheap when i first bought my vita and was very disappointed the graphics are crud and the gameplay is not very good in addition to that there are only a few music tracks and they repeat over and over again,44,11
4500,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,i love this game the music is great and the game is fun shipped fast and well packaged it is just what i was looking for,25,12
4501,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,overall i like the game the theme is dark and humorous right up my irreverent alley i picked it up on sale for 20 and i feel it is worth that price pros the soundtrack is all metal fun semi-mindless game play the goblins reactions to things are fun cons repetitive not much strategy involved,55,13
4502,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,between the thrash music and monotonous control it is like being in the army corp of he shall to be sure this game has no real replay value and is slogging to make it through the first time,36,14
4503,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,for something called army corps of he shall i expected this to be a great action game but this game truly does not live up to it is name as it is a square enix game and 2012 i thought the graphics and gameplay would be that much more enhanced as they have created some of the most memorable games to date not a game full of intense action as it is name implies i was bored within the first twenty minutes of playing,81,15
4504,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,good game long but beatable never seams boring but some times repetitive completely original style and game play like no other game,22,16
