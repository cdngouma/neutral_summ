0,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,the finish comes off super easily and the clasp is super hard to fasten the first time then falls out after that,23,0
1,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,my first time wearing a clicker in my septum and i absolutely love this clicker fit my petite nose perfectly i would purchase again,24,1
2,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,did not show up in 2 days like they were supposed to with prime shipping got them about a week later and the bar is super loose and really hard to click into the hole i bought these for my diath peircing and they are not going to work i think if i was using them for a septum identification have trouble getting them in that too and in the picture they look black but are in fact a dark silver,80,2
3,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,i have a little trouble getting clicker closed but do love the over all look it does hang low but that is what i like about it,27,3
4,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,it was really nice for the first couple of weeks sadly the clasp gave up too soon and would not stay closed enjoyed it while it lasted,26,4
5,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,the clasp broke after a few uses kind of a bummer since it looked great when it worked,18,5
6,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,i love this nose ring it fits really snugly and it is super sturdy some people mentioned having issues getting it off it can be a little difficult and i just used hemostats or roach clips as some call them to grip the bar and pull it out so that was no issue for me but i much prefer the piece being sturdy instead of falling out everytime i move my head i get so many compliments on this ring i would repuchase in a heartbeat,85,6
7,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,this is the first septum ring I have ever bought that did not turn green in my nose within a week so that is a only issue is that the hinge is really loose so you have to be really really careful while blowing / rubbing your nose and it makes it kind of difficult to put it in,54,7
8,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,the clasp will not close and if you get it to close it pops open immediately,15,8
9,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,pros feels light on the face looks good easy to put in con all the reviews about the clicker are true it is sh t broken by the next day after only replacing it maybe twice,34,9
10,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,a little bigger then i usually like but i also have a tiny nose,14,10
11,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,i bought this clicker specifically to wear to a wedding in india because it is way bigger / more showy than i normally wear it was absolutely perfect for the occasion and i liked it so much that i ended up wearing it the entire time during my three week trip it held up pretty well despite me constantly playing with it and having to take it out a couple times for facials by the time my trip was over i noticed that the locking mechanism was not working as well and that i could not play with or tug on the nose ring without it coming unclasped still the clicker cost less than my average daily coffee purchases so I had say it is still a good value for the price,125,11
12,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,avoidis not surgical or stainless steel gold looks really fake hinge is wobbly and clasp does not stay shut if you have a wide septum the bad will not fit your nose comfortably returning for refund,37,12
13,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,looks as expected but where it is supposed to click does not do so appropriately so it comes undone often,18,13
14,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,beautiful tribal swirl septum clicker perfect and works well,9,14
15,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,it is so cute and snug in my nose it does not seem too sturdy but honestly you get what you pay for I am using this for one event one night so as long as it holds out for that evening I am golden,41,15
16,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,nice look tight fighting at the nose but comfortable,9,16
17,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,it was great the first time i wore it now it will not click into place it actually got stuck in my nose for a few minutes because it closed to the side of where it is actually supposed to it looks like the hinge wore out already,46,17
18,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,i bought this for my best friend for christmas she loves it it fits her face perfectly and her best friend knows her so well haha i would recommend it,30,18
19,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,since getting it it will not clasp or hold at all even when it is out in will not clasp very cheaply made you get what you pay for i guess but still not worth it,33,19
20,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,piece is tiny it sits right up against my nose making it stick out a bit i would have preferred it hang like others photos clasp is firm which is always nice keeps it from coming loose but the hinge is loose it just flops all over the place making it hard to get in it sure is pretty although,60,20
21,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,the nose ring would not come out of my nose,10,21
22,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,looks better in the picture almost looks like a plastic piece of jewelry you would get out of a quarter machine in person also it is way to small i almost could not even get it to click shut,37,22
23,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,when thearrived it was not theshown it is in fact much lighter almost silver the clicker is very difficult and moves in other directions not just up and down into the slot still a beautiful septum ring however happy with much purchase overall but the picture is misleading,52,23
24,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,much too small and it is not as dark as the picture it looks silver ti me,17,24
25,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,was not black first of all it was more of a gun metal grey which is fine except that it was not shown that way the coating came off in less than a week and started to irritate my skin so i have already had to get rid of it,48,25
26,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,cute lightweight trendy easy to insert and remove but hangs a bit loose in the septum making it feel like you have a runny nose,25,26
27,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,this was great wore it for about two months before the clasp stopped holding closed it is very very large although the bottom rested on my lip not exactly comfortable,29,27
28,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,flat top septums are no good at least for me i can not wear them as long as i can wear a fully rounded clicker worth the price but do not expect to be able to wear it constantly,37,28
29,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,this is one of the first clickers i have bought i have heard some clickers are hard to close and particularly hard to open but this one was really easy to open the hinge is a little loose but can easily be handled i would buy a similar one from the same manufacture and would recommend to people 10/10,59,29
30,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,the clicker part of it is not stiff making it hard to put in your nose the actual ring of it i found too small for my nose as well was 3 weeks late for my shipping it is cute although,39,30
31,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,very cute it is not really black more of a gun metal grey,12,31

33,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,the quality is amazing but is a lot bigger than i thought it would be a lot i was so unhappy with it that i gave it to my sister it just was not suited for me personally but it is a beautiful and high quality piece of body jewelry,48,33
34,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,straight hinges for septum huuurrttt so much can not keep it in longer than 5 minutes need something curved it is very pretty although wish it did not hurt so much,29,34
35,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,disaster had a bad allergic reaction it is being sent back just got it friday thumbs down I am allergic to nickel so i have to find surgical steel that is 100 nickel free oh and it turned green keep in mind i got it friday april 8th and started noticing problems sunday the 10th took it out on the 11th sent back on the 12th,63,35
36,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,i love it it was super super hard to get in the first time because the bar is very loose but once i finally got it in it fit perfectly and snapped in fine it is hard to get out but not too bad after opening and closing a few times the clicker became loose but all you have to do is push the circle part closer together,67,36
37,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,did not fit clasp too hard to open and close waste of money,13,37
38,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,fits fine but it is not black more of a dark grey,11,38
39,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,pretty decent piece of jewelry girlfriend uses it and she loves it i recommend it for fancy occasions as it is not really an everyday kind of ring,27,39
40,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,had to send it back once i got it in it would not stay closed too bad it would have been really pretty,21,40
41,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,I am not sure if this was delivered to the right house i have not seen a package i wanted this fir my daughters birthday,23,41
42,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,my package arrived today and i immediately put it in it was a bit challenging to get open but it only took a few minutes to get in and the clasp closed even with my long nails i do not intend to take it out very often so hopefully i will not have any issues with the clasp wearing out it is bigger than I am used to so it does feel a little huge at first however i really like the look over all,82,42
43,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,i really like it it came earlier than expected and it is really cute the only thing i have to complain about is that it is a bit large but other than that it is great and i would recommend it,39,43
44,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,cute at first sight lasted for 2 days after i took it out and put it back in the clicker did not work any longer the septum ring fell right out,30,44

48,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,i was not pleased at all the inside diameter is to small to fit comfortably it is also to clunky to look pretty once in,24,48

50,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,it is nice but it does not really fit my face sadly still recommend tho,13,50
51,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,if you but these cost it with kamar varinsh it is a glossed used on costume jewelry art painting and more it works great let dry for 2 - 5 hours i say 2 - 4 at best you should never purchase costume jewelry and not expect it to turn or cheap you have to protect it,52,51
52,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,unfortunately the bar is not long enough to fit my septum very pretty but will not work for me,18,52
53,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,cheap as pic but teeeeeeerrrrrriiiiibbbbbbbbbbllllllleeeee quality the snap does not stay,10,53
54,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,i do not usually have an issue with any of the products i buy on amazon but my god how disappointed i was with this piercing first it is super cheap made and flimsy second it is nearly impossible to put in and lastly i ordered it in black and received a silver one,52,54
55,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,it is a pretty septum clicker but unfortunately for me it is too big and looks silly my septum piercing is low so that could be why it is so big on my face hope this review helps,36,55
56,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,does not look like thepictured what so ever it is not a terrible design but it is absolutely not the sameas pictured the hole is also very small so it develops a lot of crusties,37,56
57,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,fits nice and snug it is a bit abnoxious perhaps that is why i love it so much the filigree reached down to the top of my lips the clicker is very easy to put in and take out,37,57
58,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,latch can be a little janky but it looks so cute,11,58
59,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,total waste of money i just got it in today and put it in it went in fine but then it got stuck and i could not get the clasp open to take it back out my work does not allow them and i work early in the morning so i had to go to a piercer at 11 at night and pay 10 for him to use pliers to pry the stupid thing out of my nose so basically I am never going to put it back in and i wasted money buying this dumb thing,93,59
60,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,i really like it it was easy to put in i have not changed it yet so I am not sure how it will be to take out but i love it I am getting a lot of compliments on it,38,60
61,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,shipped super fast i love this ring i get tons of compliments every time i wear it it can be a little flimsy and tricky to get in although,29,61
62,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4.0,positive,barely had it for a week I have received a ton of compliments i like it although it could be a bit too much for some people my only complaint is that it can be a bit difficult to remove,39,62
63,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,it is beautiful too hard to open and i can not clip it closed in my septum to short but i can work with it,23,63
64,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,very cheap quality turned green in my nose the first time i wore it it also will not stay clasped looks cute but you get what you pay for,28,64
65,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,i would give this zero stars if i could got it on time but it would not click in and then the bar on it flat out broke a total waste of money,32,65
66,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,very dainty jewellery but adorable on i haven nto had it long so I am sot sure if there are issues with the finish or anything like that but it is cute,31,66
67,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2.0,negative,too large for the inside of my ear and because pain hard to snap together,15,67
68,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1.0,negative,the nose ring came broken the pin was not attached to the ring itself,14,68
69,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,did not have a problem closing and opening the clicker,9,69
70,AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5.0,positive,it is a super slick in the septum it is the perfect size in my nose it is not hanguing there it is like fitted so it is like super pretty also theis like rose gold super cute i love it I have had it for a couple of months and it hasbt worn out but i use it only on special occasions,59,70
140,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5.0,positive,takes less than a second to install and works beautifully keeping any spills from the stove on top of the product instead of falling down onto the cabinet and stove i have a white stove and countertops so it also looks great too i like the l-shaped design which is magnatized so it clings to the side of the stove great product,62,0
141,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5.0,positive,i really like the design of these guards they are l-shaped rather than the other t shaped ones that i have seen the advantage to this design is that your stovetop does not need to be exactly level with your counters for these to work the vertical magnetized side adheres the the side of your stove and the horizontal part rests on top of your counter i have had no problems with the magnets as described by the other reviewer i think the quality of thisis very good,90,1
142,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1.0,negative,the manetic strip separated from the plastic after a couple of days so you see the magnet against the stove this is a piece of junk,26,2
143,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4.0,positive,the magnets hold the strips against the stove so it does not slide around also there is a little play on the height of the stove and counter so strips can go up or down to compensate,36,3
144,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2.0,negative,placed it between therange and the adjacent countertop per instructions good fit after i trimmed about 3/4 off the length to fit my counters after less than one month while frying up a batch of fresh wild mushrooms one night the dang thing melted and warped a goodbut poor choice of materials it needs a higher-temperature resistant plastic it is being used next to a stove fer cryin out loud,74,4
145,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4.0,positive,what a greatstops crumbs grease and more from slipping into the cracks and keeps clean up at a minimal easy to install and keep clean wish i had thought of it sooner,33,5
146,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4.0,positive,they do not fit between my stove and new cabria stone counter top so now using along the side of the deep freezer and the wall so dust bunnies stay out of the,33,6
147,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1.0,negative,the first time i cooked with this on one of the sides warped but i was able to bend it back a bit the second time the magnet started to stick melt to the stovetop and pulled away from the further-warping plastic there has still a bit of melted magnet residue on the side of my stove this is not appropriate for actual use on a stove-top while cooking maybe for looks but not for use waste of money wish i could rate it 0 stars,84,7
148,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4.0,positive,works fine for what it was designed to do especially like the longer length the magnetic strip keeps it in place,21,8
149,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1.0,negative,thought the magnet would be great they are generic magnets not neodymium i did not think about the plastic needing to be heat resistant duh for myrange the plastic seems to be polystyrene they melted / warped the first time i used a large skillet and high er power i ended up buying silicone typefillers they work fine and are much cheaper,63,9
150,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5.0,positive,fit perfect cover my husbands mess up oops laughing out loud,9,10
151,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4.0,positive,it is worked really well at keeping liquids and crumbs from going in between the stove and counter i have really big gaps between them although so i think it would hold up better if that were not the case the magnet strip has come unglued from the plastic which is annoying but i think were my gaps smaller it would have a harder time of doing so but they are still working,72,11
152,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2.0,negative,the website description does not have information about it is material thickness and it is critical since you have to slide it isinto thebetween counter-top and cabinet it only says the length / width / height of the product in my case both edges can not fit into the gaps because it is too thick so it should have this thickness information,59,12
153,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5.0,positive,solved the problem of changing out a glide in stove with free standing with granite countertops the fit was not exact and the extenders solved the problem,27,13
154,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1.0,negative,save your money these warped within just a few months and made them useless the fit was never very good from the beginning,23,14
155,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2.0,negative,the plastic warps i had to shim it so hide the heat warps would have bought the metal ones but stupid amazon would not ship them to canada,28,15
156,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,after doing extensive research on dishwashers we selected this model bosch this dishwasher is amazing cleans tremedously the dishes are spotless every time quiet performance a terrific value and excellent cleaning ability buy this one and you will not be disappointed,41,0
157,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,this is a great productit is very quiet i was looking for a drinking glass and opened the dishwaser to find one it was running that is quiet,27,1
158,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,i have owned a more upscale bosch before and loved it recently moved and bought a house with a relatively new whirlpool that cleaned nothing was loud and was too short to allow the upper arm to go around when my stone wear plates were in after multiple cleanings and more i saw a best buy sale and went looking for another bosch the options in store were not great and this was the low end choice no adjustable shelf i decided this was not worth the 300 difference did not notice there was no rinse only cycle until reading the instructions after installation decided to just live with it so firsthad dried on cheese other assorted rinsed in the sink by teenager stuff used the auto setting this works great and have not worried since have only had for a short time but would buy it again is deep enough for pots and pans and have not tried to put the wine glasses in the upper rack yet to gauge height it works as well as the more expensive model i owned previously,183,2
159,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,we have been using this dishwasher regularly for about 3 months now so i can not comment on it is longevity however so far we are very impressed this model is extremely quiet and gets dishes very clean with minimal pre-rinsing I have seen reviews of other bosch models that complain about the dishes not being dry when they are finished but we have not had that issue at all just follow the instructions and use some jetdry and you will not have problems so far a quality product we would definitely buy it again,86,3
160,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,great dishwasher at a great price gets dishes squeaky clean plenty of features for what i need you can set extra dry heat cycle and set the amount of rinse agent i use auto wash function with extra dry heat off and it figures out cycle strength wash time and amount of water on it is own dishes are still hot to the touch when unloading a half hour after complete it is quiet so i do not have to turn up the tv anymore when the dishwasher is going,88,4
161,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2.0,negative,we have the she3ar7uc we had a need for something quick in a very busy time i bought what cr and consumerresearch recommended we have only done oneso far and it did clean the dishes well but my two complaints are 1 it is a funny internal design and unclear how you are supposed to put the dishes in and how you are supposed to fit in big baking caserole dishes 2 if you forgot to put something in for ayou can not stop the cycle and continue where it was you have to stop the entire cycle and start all over again very annoying whoever designed this clearly must not entertain much because that seems to be a pretty common thing to have in every dw I have ever used and is going to take a lot of getting used to,140,5
162,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,we have had our bosch dishwasher just over 2 years the sanitizer light stopped working a couple of weeks ago and the dishwasher seemed to be working overtime a longer cycle and unclean dishes at the end the repair main told us it was because the electronic circuit board had burnt out apparently the water coming into the dishwasher when it was turned on was not at maximum hotness and so the dishwasher was having to work overtime to get the water to the correct temperature the dishwasher we had before for 20 years showed no such necessity and i had never considered this requirement before nor had i been told about it disappointing,116,6
163,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,we have owned this dishwasher a week and it seems excellent it cleans very well very well we do not rinse off food before loading it is so quiet that you have to strain to hear it i like that it is good on energy and water this was a less expensive option of models recommended by consumer reports i purchased it at lowes for a little less price,69,7
164,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,i have had a mid-price bosch that was recommended by consumer reports for two years now and i can not understand why no one else has complained about it it cleans great at first and is quiet but the wheels are constantly falling off we have lost 4 of the 8 of them when you pull out a full bottom rack it skittles across the dishwasher door and every time i worry that the whole thing will crash on the floor the water flows through jets in two different spinning arms the tiniest bit of food often a scrap of lettuce or something unidentifiable will get stuck in the jets this signifiantly impacts cleaning i struggle to pick it out with tweezers i do rinse my dishes before loading them,131,8
165,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2.0,negative,I had be interested to hear whether any of the other reviewers have had this problem but a couple of months after installing this dishwasher it started to smell terrible after months of trying to keep the filter clean and living with the terrible odor i called a repairman since it is still under warranty he came and cleaned out the filter and sold me some dishwasher cleaner and told me that it is normal to have 1/4 inch of water under the filter after running the dishwasher that is the source of the smell he ran the dishwasher with the cleaner and a couple of hours later still stinky I have googled it and this seems to be very common to bosch owners i will absolutely never buy a bosch dishwasher again pros it does a decent job cleaning the dishes although it is not perfect there is often food stuck to the dishes after running cons it reeks the dishes come out sopping wet unless you use jet dry which is expensive it could definitely be roomier my last dishwasher was a builder-grade basic one and i could fit a lot more dishes in it,194,9
166,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2.0,negative,we recently purchased this dishwasher at a local big box store it cleans and drys well and looks nice and is relatively quiet we are a two person household so the size is fine however it makes a very irritating high pitch sound throughout the entire cycle we exchanged the dishwasher for another one thinking and hoping that we had simply received a bad one the first time around unfortunately the second one makes the same horrible noise i can not believe no one else has complained about this we even added a piece of foam behind the foot plate but it did not dampen the noise enough,106,10
167,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,a repairman just left my house after an unsuccessful attempt at repairing a five-year-old bosch dishwasher it needed a new control board which was discontinued unavailable recalled and the recall had expired in other words my not-so-old very expensive dishwasher is junk I shall not be looking for another bosch would you,51,11
168,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5.0,positive,we have only had this for about a month so i can not speak to longevity but i can tell you it is very quiet it is a breeze to install you can adjust the amount of rinse agent used and you will probably have to adjust it it does not stack tallish things in the upper rack like our older bosch did for the money a very nice washer i am very pleased with the job it does and the low noise level update 7/2/12 the dishwasher is very sensitive to food particles in the water be sure to rinse well before putting them in the washer still love the dishwasher november 2 2014 still chugging away not a problem in any way update 8/7/2012 had a problem with the washer not starting and having two blinking lights repairman came out on a warrantee call he could not figure it out either we finally soved it by turning off the circuit breaker and letting it sit for about 10 minutes it started working normally then still love the dishwasher just be sure to keep the food strainer clean,185,12
169,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,ours has been broken for almost a year it will not complete it is cycle and just jumps to clean 8 different repair guys 5 different control boards i am not exageratting anyway ours was a lemon terrible purchase,39,13
170,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,i own several apartments and have purchased and installed at least 15 dishwashers this dishwasher replaced a 12 year old whirlpool it has several problems 1 it stinks up the entire house 2 the door pops open about seven times during a cycle-shutting the unit down 3 it does not dry dishes 4 cleaning is just ok not as good as the 12 year old whirlpool it is replacing after some research review sites i have found several others complaining about the strong odor many many many people are having the problem with door latch it is improperly designed in order to get the sound level down the frame is built out of plastic instead of metal it flexes the latch just barely holds door shut one finger will open it as it runs the thing flexes and the door pops open takes longer than 24 hrs to run ain order to achieve energy star rating they quit putting in drying elements i guess ones suppose to hand dry one would think after 12 years there would be some improvement i certainly did not know i would be going backwards,190,14
171,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2.0,negative,i purchased this dishwasher because of the bosch name and my daughter-in-law has a bosch my ge was so rough on my dishes that it chipped the edges of cups and bowls i was not able to see this particular model in person so i took a chance and ordered it not through amazon but from a local store i will not purchase another the best thing about this dishwasher is that it is extremely quiet however it is small on the inside and would never do for a family the tines on both racks are positioned in such a way that it is very difficult to place dishes or glasses and cups the utensil basket is ok i like the piece that sections it so that spoons do not get stuck together the clincher for me is that after 2 years the main board went bad and it cost almost 300 to repair that is just for the part i had a maytag in a different house that lasted over 5 years with no service i wish i could have brought it with me when i move a more expensive model may be built better but not this one,199,15
172,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2.0,negative,i bought the new bosch ascenta because it was highly rated by consumer reports for performance and reliability but the lay out of the machine makes me wish I had bought another model the control panel is needlessly complicated compared to my old model one needs to reselect the setting eachand the rack layout is very frustrating if i have a casserole dish to wash it can only go in a place that blocks off the racks for the plates the owners manual shows various ways of loading only dishes that are models of teutonic order but where are the casserole dishes kidss cereal bowls who lives like that also should you have to open the door while it is cycling you will get a face full of water from the upper jet also the soap dispenser will not lock shut if you get even a small bit of dishwashing powder outside the tray the springless door is not very user friendly and the lower dish rack goes clanging off the tracks if you open it more than 3/4 of the way bosch designers need to buy a kenmore and take notes,192,16
173,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,we purchase our bosch because of the good reviews from several sites our machine is less than two years old and it is only my wife and i that use it we are retired and travel so usage has been minimal after exactly one year and a few days the pump went out then we had trouble with the computer screen next it would not drain again and another pump was put in with bosch represenatives he spent a whole ten minutes and left without checking to make sure it fixed to problem it did not and we have water in the bottom of the machine we have contacted our own appliance rep who believes the computer board is shot we also have had the racks replaced because of rusting all in less than 18 months we called bosch about it being a lemon no help just a bunch of lip service this machine is a mess we are ordering a new american made machine and dumping our loss never never again bosch you screw me once never again,176,17
174,Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1.0,negative,my head is killing me the high pitch noise has given me a terrible headache and is present throughout the entire cycle how is it that only one other person has commented about this I am pretty sure this will be the only review i will have about this dishwasher unless whatever is causing the noise can be fixed,58,18
196,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this product works well when you follow the instructions but it takes some patience i accidentally oversanded the area i was repairing which could have made the leather look worse but the leather conditioner included in the kit seems to have fixed it i was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair and i think this repair will not be noticeable as the damage is lower on a chair leg take the time to mix theto match the leather do the repairs in daylight and be careful to keep the mixture as close to the damaged areas as possible when applying and it works pretty well,110,0
197,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,my dogs finally put a 1 inch cut / hole in my 4000 leather couch i followed the instructions for the kit mixed a near perfect match with the colors provided deep wine / maroonand applied approximately 3 separate coats to the damaged area allowing for complete drying in between coatings i was very pleased with the result the couch is sealed and can not tear further and the patch is very discreet i would recommend this product and for those who seem to have problems with it my guess is that care was not taken with the instructions,96,1
198,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,if you have a rip of any size in your leather i would not recomend this the product says it repairs smaller rips i had a quarter inch rip in my couch and followed the instructions provided and only accomplished one thing making sure everyone knows about the rip now i would recomend looking for a professional to repair any expensive piece of leather,64,2
199,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this stuff is just stupid look up do-it-yourself leather repair and you have it i got leather magics deluxe kit and found out it is exactly like do it yourself they have the leather magic cleaner think a simple soap and water solution they have sanding paper they have leather prep think rubbing alcohol they have a leather compound in a tiny tiny container you supposed to apply several times uhhh how can you apply something so tiny several times then they have acrylic paint so in the end you have your beautiful leather couch covered in paint looks good until you sit on it so i say stupid,104,3
200,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,too many steps 4 pages of directions could not matchto couch,12,4
201,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,what a rip off only colors not found in nature and not qualified for a return so disappointed,18,5
202,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i was disappointed in this product i purchased the kit to repair a tear in my beloved leather couch the sub-patch and leather patch were barely large enough for my repair would it have been that difficult to make them a decent size the special leather adhesive was dried out and unusable i used wood glue 7 of the 9 leather filler colors were also old and almost solid fortunately i was able to use brown on my couch but had no way tomatch i rated 2 stars since i was able to make the repair but clearly this kit had been sitting on the shelf for many years,112,6
203,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,two of the colors had congealed making it impossible to make a match,13,7
204,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this thing is amazing i have not had to use it on any big cuts or anything but i have used it several times already on my new leather couch our dear cat satan has ran through it a couple times and used it as a scratch post about three times so there were plenty of punctures all covered nicely and blended perfectly only thing is you can tell when the light hits it a certain way but that is expected still worked really well,83,8
205,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i have a bicast leather couch and based on a youtube video i was looking for leather studio clear paint to fix a rip and a peeling spot the leather studio product was discontinued so i gave this a shot i did not use the patch that came with the kit instead i applied this in layers just as the video showed with the leather studio it is not perfect but you can not tell without looking for it and having the ability to mix ato match the leather is also a plus it is only been a week but i have had dogs and kids jumping on the couch and no issues yet,113,9
206,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i used this kit to repair a 2-inch irregular tear in a dark-blue leather couch cushion the kit performed as advertised and the repair seems solid however the repair required considerable dexterity and care and even after long trial-and-error i never could get thecorrect so the repair is obvious the kit could also benefit from additional backing material patches only one is included in the kit and this effectively makes the kit suitable for one use only but it was worth the price,86,10
207,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,oh my god i was desprate to fix a spot on our favorite chair someone left a bottle of bleach out eating a hole along with some horrible looking discolorations a bit tricky to get just the right shade of deep wine after blending i took my finger and would add the smallest bit ofto a test spot bottom of the chair mix quickly you will be amazed mine took three cover / blending now you can not tell at all perfect for small jobs,82,11
208,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,covered my rips and holes nicely for about a week of normal use the gel dries nicely and looks great after a couple of hours but will lose all of it is flexibility after a week or two the repair gel begins to crack itself completely nullifying the whole reason you applied it in the first place junk product unless you are trying to patch and area that sees zero tension and/or wear like the back of your couch,77,12
209,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,works like magic you can not find the mark unless you are really really looking for it company comes over to visit and can not tell it has been repaired,28,13
210,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,the package i received appeared yellowed and old like it has been sitting on a shelf for some time it also provides only what appears to be the barest amount of materials to utilize no real margin for error i have not yet had opportunity to actually try fixing my problem but the quality of the kit is rather poor,59,14
211,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,great product unless you knew you would never know my leather bench had tears in it this product is worth every penny and could easily sell for hundreds of dollars,30,15
212,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this works well i would prefer to have more white to mix with colors,14,16
213,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,very happy with the results would buy again,8,17
214,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,seems too all purpose use to me was ok but really not invisible to see the mend in terms of surface texture,22,18
215,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the kit does not provide enough dye paste to do large leather repairs i was forced to purchase the kit twice to complete a section of my ottoman,28,19
216,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,amazing product i had to use a lot more heat than recommended i tested it to be sure it would not affect the surrounding leather ended up saving my thousand dollar couch,32,20
217,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,ruined my couch we now have to cover up the repaired area with a throw blanket i wasted so much money trying tomatch and more the entire kit was terrible it looks worse than before i used it,39,21
218,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i have not used it yet but by reading the directions i think it will be great,17,22
219,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,more fabric and leather should have been included in the kit,11,23
220,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,not recommended for jeep vinyl seats it flaked off leaving a spongey stretchy melted layer underneath ended up recovering my seats with real leather instead haha do not use it on your jeep seat jeep seats are not leather and maybe not vinyl either which is what this is made for,49,24
221,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for this product is mediocre at best for what i needed basically had some cat scratches on the arms of a bicast leather couch small amount ofcompound to work with and the shade that i ended up with was slightly off yeah it covered the scratches but the process actually made the rest of the couch worse off than when it started i am now trying the more expensive products from leather touchup dyecom,79,25
222,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,absolutely love this product it is pretty darn close to perfect in fixing leather although it would be nice to be able to dull it up a bit as it leaves a fairly shiny finish I have also used it for fixing plastic rubber and more it dries like a latex finish and can be peeled off carefully if you mess up using a paintbrush to apply it in small spots works well too the only complaint i have is that i believe the kit should have twice as much black as the other colors because it gets used up too fast otherwise it is a great product,106,26
223,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,did not really help repair our leather couch it really just made it worse,13,27
224,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,saved my leather couch easy to mix colors you can not tell where my couch was damaged i would recommend this product to anyone before giving up something that you really loved give it a try first,34,28
225,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i was extremely disappointed in this product i repaired a minor scratch in the leather on my couch and it now looks well janky it has nothing to do withmatching either it is quite easy to mix the colors to match whatever theof the leather is the problem is that it does not have the right texture it is incredibly easy to tell where the repaired section is because it is so smooth not a fan,75,29
226,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,have yet to use it but will be handy on my leather purses that get pen marks or peeling,19,30
227,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,would be nice to have measurement guides so you could recreate the identical formula,14,31
228,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,does not adhere well to some surfaces when there is incidental friction,12,32
229,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,it was very easy to use i bought this because i damage my leather massage chair during the move very easy to use and fixed the problem and my new place has laminate floor i noticed that there were few chips on few floor boards i was looking for laminate floor repair kit but actually i was able to use this to fix that issue also,66,33
230,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,way too complicated not an easy application as claimed,9,34
231,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i am disappointed with this product it does not do a good job of repairing leather i would not recommend this product,22,35
232,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,yesit help me to fix my car seat very good,10,36
233,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,easy to use and fixed a tear in a brand new leather coat saving it,15,37
234,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it works pretty well but i should have used it two years ago do not wait repair early,17,38
235,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,used this product to repair my vinal seat in my car product was fairly easy to apply and seems to stand up to the stress of getting in and out of the vehiclewas no problem with me because the brown that came in the kit was the same as what i needed otherwise i think matching thecould be a challenge,64,39
236,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this product was less than satisfactory product was completely dried out and unusable i would not recommend this product to anyone,21,40
237,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it is marginal if you follow the directions carefully and it is a minor fix you will probably be ok but most of the time someone will want to repair a more extensively damaged article and it does not handle big rips very well in my own case it was a torn leather jacket i followed the instructions and wound up with a fix that was functional but looked cheesy and rough part of the problem is it is nearly impossible to get thematched seal to look good if the repair is large plus the fix is kind of flimsy after a couple weeks it started to fall apart i came away wishing i had just done a patch,117,41
238,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,all the colors other than black and brown were dry and hard rendering the kit useless,16,42
239,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,I had like to give this product five stars but when i went to repair my car seat the adhesive was solid it had not been opened by me but since i did not have any adhesive i could not fix my seat poor packing if adhesive dries up before use,48,43
240,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,useless the prep flluid ruined the leather and most of the colored fillers were dried up absolute crap do not buy it,20,44
241,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it does what it says but does not really furnish enough to fix more than one or two cracks would not order again,23,45
242,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,worked just fine but these things only last so long and there is enough for touch up now and then,20,46
243,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,definitely exceeded what i thought it would do excellent product,10,47
244,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i repaired my wingback recliner got it to match pretty good but if you are picky i suggest you use a professional my husband had gouged a few small holes in the arm keeping his pocket knife in his cargo pants you can tell how old we are the chair is about 15 years old or older it looks much better than the holes did but if you inspect it you can see the repaired places however no one looks at my stuff that closely had to send another kit back i ordered by another maker their repair stuff was dried up appears all of this kit was good there is no stress on the place i repaired so i imagine it will last as long as the chair i have a small split in my lexus seat also 15 years old and I am afraid to try that bc it puts stress on it every time i get in the car afraid i will make it worse,167,48
245,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,pain to get right and a pain to put on but so far it is lasted you can see the repair but it is holding and it is not getting worse,28,49
246,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the adhesive was extremely difficult tomatch which is probably a ploy to sell tospecific set after an hour of mixing and testing i ended up with athat dried as a splotchy dark tan but frankly i did not care about theas long as it repaired the damage it did not i put on about 5 layers and let it dry for 36 hours within an hour after sitting in the drivers seat the adhesive cracked and came apart this was a complete waste of money for me,93,50
247,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i have repaired several pieces of furniture with these kits for myself and friends the bond and the patching is easy enough the tricky part is thematching if you follow themixing guidelines and make small tests allow them to dry for 24hrs to really get a sense of how thewill finish you should be able to make a really great patch,67,51
248,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,did not help fix the cracking on my car seat just made a bigger mess,14,52
249,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this kit does work it takes some time to mix the colors just right but once you get the right tone it looks great it just does not last the patch just peels off after while not a good product it also does not include that much product for a larger application i had to reapply a few times since it came off after a month or two,66,53
250,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it does not have the composite most of the secondary colors were dried and left with very small usable quantity this may be suitable for leather jackets but definitely not for sofas,32,54
251,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,have not used it yet but it was exactly what i expected,12,55
252,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,after six months the glue fails and matching theis almost impossible will not buy again,17,56
253,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,did an outstanding job on my leather coach,8,57
254,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,once you get theright it really is magic application takes several coats so you get multiple tries to match the,23,58
255,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i could not get theto match after half a day since it dries differently than when wet which is understandable it makes it even more difficult and the repair keeps peeling,32,59
256,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,total bs the stuff peels off do not bother with it,10,60
257,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,had to send it back i already had one,9,61
258,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,looks like crap does not work more like a toy think do it yourself window tint trust me you will not get this to look good,28,62
259,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i might have scored this product higher but some of the patch materials were dried out a condition the instuctions warn will because failrue of the repair the package appeared to be sealed and tight but the cheap plastic poys containing the colored patch material had loose-fitting lids that allowed the contents to dry this is indeed what we have experienced peeling of the surface i can not recommend this product,72,63
260,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,this product did not work for me first of all the glue did not stick no matter how hard i tried i tried putting more glue but in the end i just gave up i would not recommend this product my sofa still has the tear that looks so horrible and i am at a loss as to what to do to repair it,64,64
261,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i purchased thisto repair the claw marks on my dinning room chairs thanks mr kitty this product worked great and came with everything i needed to repair these unsightly imperfections i was really worried about getting theright since my dinning room chairs are a teali mixed the green leather paint with a touch of black and thecame out perfect if your leather furniture is damaged this is the answer to your problem,80,65
262,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this seems like it is going to work pretty well overall I am upset although because they do not tell you the glue is instant i mean as soon as the leather touches the sub-patch once the glue is applied it bonds and there is no repositioning it so i have puckered edges to my tear now puckered under so it is not like i can trim off the edges hopefully i can make it look better with the repair compound but if you get this know that the glue is absolutely instant this should have made a great repair but because of the glues properties it now looks pretty bad,108,66
263,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,it is great it is strong enough to stabilize the tear in a very used part of the leather cushion on our couch the colors allowed me to mix the green brown and a tiny dab of black to get the exactof green i required for the task,50,67
264,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it kept leather from tearing more and was good size to begin with however had hard time matching and keeping it small like tear like said it dries fast and takes some skill it did work well just i did not do as good as i like,43,68
265,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the repair is not completely invisible since i know where to look but no one has said anything if you have a large tear i would suggest ordering extra of the colors that you need,35,69
266,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i had a few cracks in somewhat faded black leather and the kit easily patched those the problem was getting thematch right and it was really hard to get the right gray,34,70
267,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this product was delivered on time and preformed as advertised it took me about an hour to make the repair it was not perfect but it did look pretty good and keeps the seat from tearing more,36,71
268,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,we bought new leather furniture on liquidation sale and got an extra discount because there was an inch long cut on the side of the love seat we bought this kit to patch it I am not a very handy person and definitely not crafty decorative artsy or anything else you think you might should be to repair brand-new furniture but thanks to this kit my couch was fixed in under 20 minutes it comes with an empty container to mix your colors in and a mixing guide they are so easy to mix to get a goodmatch the instructions are easy to follow and work perfectly if you do i covered the cut let it dry overnight covered it once more and cleaned the area after it dried i did notice that the leather cleaner seemed to slightly dry out the area i used it on but i rubbed a bit of coconut oil on it which fixed it back up I had definitely recommend this kit,167,72
269,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it looked good at first but now after several weeks it is starting to peel up i do not know if it is operator error or the product,27,73
270,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,my german shepherd had punctured a few holes in our leather couches this mended them up and prevented further damage take your time matching the colors as they seem to dry a little darker,34,74
271,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i received the product and it was all dried out i attempted to use a thinner to see if would fix it and it did not threw it away i will never buy this product again and i do not recommend it I had give it zero stars if i could,48,75
272,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this leather repair kit was a true miracle you need to be precise when cutting the leather to fit your hole otherwise you will be sanding forever other than that i have no complaints and would definitely order it again if i need more,43,76
273,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,while i would have rated the product a five i actually have to wait and see how long the repair will last other than that the product really worked even better than advertised as long as you follow the instructions will recommend product thank you,44,77
274,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,be sure to mix thelighter than theyou desire it darkened up quite a bit my repair was a four inch rip on a leather sofa i followed the directions and watched others perform repairs online the repair looks good 8 out of 10 mymatching was not so good i mixed it a little dark the product performed perfectly thank you,66,78
275,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,looks horrible on any leather not easy to use does not do the trick do not waste your money not recommended,20,79
276,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i bought this for my husband when he replaced the leather seats in his car he poked a whole where he should not have even although the whole was not in a very obvious place this kit helped to save the day the whole was patched and was not noticable afterward good buy,53,80
277,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,well it looked absolutely beautiful when i applied it thestarted out much lighter which i expected then dried to match perfectly blended right in however it does not seem to be holding up i do not know if it is my leather which could be some kind of synthetic stuff not sure I shall try again and use more coats let us see if that works,65,81
278,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,did not work on our car seat the ripped leather about 2 - 3 inches would tear out again after a few days,21,82
279,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,it worked good for about a month then the patch dried / broke and the hole is back i do not recommend buying this to use on something that gets a lot of wear and tear like a sofa or a chair like i did,42,83
280,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,product is too hard to use and kept rubbing offmatching was impossible for me and the product did not dry well,23,84
281,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i have not had the time to use it yet hope it works very well on my truck seat thank you,21,85
282,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it is a tad complicated to mix the stuff to the right consistencybut once you do that it works great,23,86
283,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,certainly would do the job difficulty in mixing paints to match theis the greatest challenge but not the fault of the manufacturer this kit contains what one would need to make any minor leather repairs,37,87
284,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the kit includes base colors that are to be mixed to get amatching the leather good luck with that this is nearly impossible add a little of this then add a little of that it is never right,40,88
285,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed had cut in arm of leather sofa did not work i would not recommend the product to anyone,22,89
286,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i could never get a decentmatch and the repaired spot sticks out like a sore thumb i sorry i bought this,23,90
287,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i bought the carpet / upholstery kit i cut a piece of fabric and sent it in for them to match thein the kit is way off mine is like burgundy-brown they sent like burgundy-grey i emailed and got no response i called and asked for a refund they said i could send it back to re-tint i said I had have to pay to ship it and since they could not get it right the first time I had rather just get my money back i was told i have to pay to ship it back anyway so i said then I shall ship it back for a re-tint i suppose they will want another material sample she said just send it back and we will refund because it does not sound like we will be able to please you i said oh i send a sample you guys do not match it and I am the problem so i disputed the charge with my credit card company my suggestion it to find someone else,166,91
288,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,we used the product on an old leather couch and it worked quite well the hardest part was mixing theand decided that making it lighter was the best thing to do as it dried darker,37,92
289,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,not sure i was going to be able to match theetc it was actually a snap and kind of fun even i did it over two days put the patch in place and let it dry and then came back the next day and blended it in with theyou would have to know it was there to even realize it was patched nearly impossible to tell thumbs up,72,93
290,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the description was a bit misleading to me i tried using it but had no way of making it happen i ended up disposing of it,26,94
291,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,works exactly as described no complaints except that there was not as much paint / putty as I had have liked but still did what it described well only as good as you apply it do a good job and it looks great get sloppy and it will show,44,95
292,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,seam was ripped on good quality office chairs i bought cheaply from sale at work since it is a seam repair i did not expect it to hold up but it is seen daily use including from a 7-year-old monkey boy who has to climb all over it while sitting for a couple months now and stil looks holding up not the prettiest repair but since it is black no one will be looking that closely,73,96
293,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i bought about 7 different leather repair kits black leather spfa was damaged / worn in several places and got super confused with the reviews so just bought one of each of the different types this one was by far the easiest to use and gave the best results all i used was the black so no mixing of colors s o really can not comment on how easy that is but simply applying a thin layer of the black stuff to one of the very worn patches on my sofa really helped make it look better it is not fabulous if your really close up but that is probably more cos my hand was not very steady but from a few steps away looks pretty good wish identification bought more of this one and not all the others ah well,139,97
294,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i used it to repair my brown leather sofa and it looked completely new when the repair kit was used i can not even notice where the scratch / rip was,28,98
295,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i followed the instructions but could not get theor the texture right the instructions said to make thelighter as it would darken as it dried it actually gets lighter as it dries the texture turned out like plastic sheeting it would have been better and less permanent to slap a piece oftape on the leather,60,99
296,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,the instructions for this product were hard to understand and trying to mix the righta pain in the i would not recommend this product to anyone,27,100
297,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i was repairing a hole in sleeve of school varsity jacket for my first time using a product like this it worked good i spent considerable amt of time getting theto match but finally got an exact match yellow / gold / brown,41,101
298,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,this product works well in repairing ripped or damaged leather we used it on our ivoryleather couch and also a black leather jacket the only thing is that it already comes with glue so no need to buy a separate liquid leather stitch,44,102
299,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this product cracked where my leather had cracked and now is peeling so i am left with cracked leather and now a peeling product that looks even worse than what i started with do not buy,35,103
300,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,it took a long time to finally get theto match but finally got it close enough i had a 1 square damaged area on a chair that was ultra leather fake leather just the outside skin was pulled off i filled it with this paint and now it is hardly noticeably,53,104
301,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i used this kit and did not like it at all had to mix different things to try and matchdried ok but the smell was like burnt plastic and lasted for days this kit is ok for a cheap repair but the area i repaired actually looks worse,50,105
302,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,if you take your time to get theright prep the area and do several light coats it can turn out pretty nice i do not think it is possible to get it where you can not tell there was a repair but it is much better than a gaping hole,48,106
303,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i bought this kit because i got a small tear in an expensive designer jacket the trick to this stuff works to the best ability is a a spot that can be blended b on non textured leather c a reasonable repair do not expect miracles my jacket is black calfskin and very soft very smooth very fragile i repaired it and you can not notice a problem unless i tell you about it the jacket was a 2000 john varvatos and i trust this stuff on it it will do just fine,91,107
304,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,easy to use did not need to apply heat clear directions for applying paste i applied three layers 2 are recommended there was enough paste for three layers madscientist52,28,108
305,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i have an inexpensive dark vinyl couch that had several tears and i purchased this to repair them mixing the colors to match my couch was pretty easy but applying the product was a little difficult to get the texture to blend in the end the product did a decent job of patching the holes and the repair is hardly noticable in most light i believe if my couch was any lighter init would not have blended well all in all it did what i expected it to do however if i had a more expensive couch or the leather was anything lighter than my espressoi would probably call a professional for the repair,118,109
306,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,you know what i was skeptical but we got it anyway we tried it on a very obvious 1 tear on the front visible portion of our dark brown leather couch thanks alot kids and you can barely see it now pretty easy to get the righteasy to do just follow the directions can you see where the problem is yes if you are really looking for it but it is way better than a rip or a piece oftape and for way cheaper than a professional repair worth the risk i say,97,110
307,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,if you are getting this to repair a 5000 genuine leather couch then just keep walking get a professional but if you have just an average-priced or bicast couch this product is perfect if you can get your colors right you will be pretty pleased i spent some time mixing colors and everyone has been impressed with the results most have to really search and feel around to find the tear it was originally about a 1 1/2 inch tear in a bicast leather couch and it was growing daily if you have a rip in a bicast couch you need to stop it as soon as possible because it will keep ripping also i put on about 4 - 5 layers of the goo over a 3 day period and it is held amazingly strong it might even be stronger than it was before great product a little pricey but it is better than a nasty tear as a side note if you can send in a sample of your leather to leather magic they will magic thefor you,173,111
308,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this is the second time using this product to repair a tear in a leather sofa works pretty much as advertised will repair small tears it does take some time several light layers to make a good repair but the end result is good toughest thing ismatching but the includedguide is helpful the first repair i did same spot held up for 2 - 3 years sitting directly on it daily I am hoping i did a better job this time and it will hold up for a few years a lot cheaper than the alternative new sofa,99,112
309,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,did not like it at all just used it once on my leather couch after using it the leather got harder and started ripping more i will never recommend this product,30,113
310,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i have a crack on my white leather car seats however i was not brave enough to try the colors on my seats theset has white but it does not match my seatsand it was really hard to tell whichi should mix to match the seat this package is not expensive the glue does the work it fixed the crack but left some darkmarks on it,72,114
311,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i used thisto repair a worn lay-z-boy chair armrest i did not get a perfect match onmy choice and i did not do a perfect job but it is very adequate and serviceable,34,115
312,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i somehow ripped my nice black leather coat an l-shaped tear about 1 both vertically and horizontally in a spot that is over my pants right rear pocket i took it to a leather shop here in la and they quoted me 75 to repair it mostly labor no doubt on the advice of a co-worker i figured I had give this kit a try before popping for that much the tears location was another big factor in my decision give this kit a try since it is only visible to people behind me who look down which i would question anyway i received the kit followed the simple instructions and 30 minutes later voila no more tear it is not invisible by any means but since my jacket is black with a slightly faded appearance / finish the kits black coloring blended in perfectly with the leathers appearance andand although the kit includes several colors and instructions how to blend them to achieve the desiredi was fortunate that i only had to tone down the black coloring to account for the faded look of the leather if the user needs aother than black then your mileage may vary,200,116
313,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i bought this kit from magic mender website 1st problem it does not match thethen when you left your car under the sun wow it is so sticky it will look nice as long you do not use and seat on it one more thing it does not last in other words it is a useless thing,57,117
314,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,better than nothing but not much had about an inch and a half tear in a leather chair head rest followed the instructions and it turned out very visible and more like a rubbery patch than soft leather i think it will keep the tear from getting bigger but it looks terrible,52,118
315,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the product works very well to fix a hole or tear in leather mine was a couch the only problem i had was the cleanser took the shine out of the leather so if you have a shine to the leather make sure you use the cleanser sparingly only on the area you intend to directly fix otherwise i was able to match thealmost 100 very good product my work looked a little sloppy so you have to be very careful and do it in stages i will use this again if i have another rip,98,119
316,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i got my couch fixed and it looks great it was so easy to match the colors and repair it myself great product quick service thanks,26,120
317,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i had my leather surface peel off to a expensive camel leather couch i have and this worked great you have to add the darker little by little and test theon the area before putting it on to see if thehad to be adjusted but worked great can not even tell it peeled just remember thedries darker when dried highly recommend,66,121
318,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,we have a 6 year old leather couch that had worn on one cushion and a 3 x3 hole had formed it really needs to be reupholstered but i do not have the funds for that right now i bought this kit instead for a fix i was super worried about using it because I am not aperson and had never done a repair like this but the instructions were so simple and the patch looks good I am not going to lie and say it is not noticeable but compared to the hole that was there before this is a dream,100,122
319,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,arrived in a timely manner matched our lariat leather seat just test in area not visable just follow the instructions and you will not go wrong sincerely eddie g,28,123
320,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,the rip is hardly noticeable should get another 10 years of use the rip is completely closed andmatches perfectly thank you,22,124
321,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,had an l shaped tear on seat cushion of my couch maybe 4 long figured i would need a kit that was better than average given the size and shape of the tear theis as described including more than enough fill to do multiple jobs it could use more underlayment but seems like you could use almost any cloth as such for future repairs my couch is dark brown somatching was quite simple the most challenging aspect is prepping the tear getting the tear to line up and then holding it long enough for the glue to dry kit includes one rubbing alcohol swab not nearly enough for the whole job considering you clean the surface before applying the fill and can use it to smooth the fill between coats and as posted by another multiple coats are the way to go i did not use the 2 sq patch included,155,125
322,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,great product that actually works just need a bit of practice with applying the compound in a smooth manner all necessary supplies are provided to make your fix look great i used it to repair a big rip in my leather car seat and it worked beautifully highly recommend,49,126
323,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the patch itself was pretty easy and seems strong gives about a 2 x 2 patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath you use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole needing at least 1/2 overlap in each direction you cut the leather to fit the hole and thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth i have not tried tho the hardest part is mixing the paint to match they have instructions for basic colors ex tan but to get it to be theyou want is not for the faint of heart they might say mix orange yellow white and brown add more brown if this add more yellow if this i sort of wish they would show shades and give ratios to mix,142,127
324,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i was a little scared by the multiple steps and having to mix my own matchingbut it worked out great you can still tell it is a repair if you look but it is not noticeable at all themix directions are easy enough the tricky part was cutting / shaping and installing the sub-patch tip with the light sanding stay within 1/4 to 1/2 from the tear any further will be mard to mask with the filler and could end up having noticeably less sheen that the repaired area and original leather overall great product,95,128
325,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,please bear in mind this review has nothing against the seller it is against the manufacturer do not waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it that is what i have and this was a waste of money i would imagine it would work better if you had some outright holes in a leather couch bigger than what i have the patching pieces sub-material and the leather were just too big to fit into the holes i have so now I am just using the glue to see if i can glue the rips shut unfortunately i really thought this would be a better product based on the price compared to other similar products,122,129
326,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this was a total ripoff i needed to cover up some cat claw prick marks on my leather barstools they are black so i did not have to worry aboutmixing the first thing to go wrong was the finish on the product after it dried it was very shiny like patent leather so my barstools looked like they had tone-on-tone polka dots the second thing to go wrong was when i cleaned off the stools several days later during my routine housework using a normal soft dishcloth wet and well wrong out no cleaning product on it at all just plain water i lightly wiped off my barstools and there went my new shiny polkadots all the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic the best thing i can say is that the claw marks are still there and i am right back where i started the worst thing i can say is i wasted my money on this product i definitely would not recomend it for a fine piece of leather furniture,174,130
327,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i think success depends on your ability to match your ownbut i was ultimately really surprised at how good it looked they do not give you much although so after very good success with the 1st kit i had to buy two more for enough to patch up my sofa,51,131
328,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,wish i could say that this product was great but when i opened the paint colors they were all rubbery and would not mix or spread easily,27,132
329,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,repaired a tear and touched up a few nicks saved me from buying a new sofa i wish i would have matched thea little better that was my fault although i was too impatient and used up all the white so i could not lighten themore also touched up my black leather car seats black is easy no mixing,62,133
330,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,the manufacturer makes it clear that this kit is not intended for use with suede i bought it anyway figuring what the heck it is worth a try when the alternative was to throw away my torn suede jacket or pay a lot for a professional repair and maybe I shall need it for something else down the road well i just tried and am absolutely delighted with the results it was really easy to use and no one is going to notice the repair,83,134
331,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,the past reviewer was correct if you have a large rip do not use this product unless you want everybody to know where the rip is as it show up even worse would not recommend this product at all,39,135
332,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,i followed the directions to the t in a few days the split started showing on top of the dried so called paint please save your money,27,136
333,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,this product was an absolute disaster i had a huge hole in my leather couch which this product describes how to put a subpatch and glue the pieces together except that the glue was old and putty-like it would not hold anything together secondly although it claims to tell you how to combine the basic colors to get anyin the world it is a very basic description like tan is a combination of yellow orange white and brown this resulted in a salmon colored liquid when i tried to make tan anyhow in desperation to get my couch not to continue to rip i took out a needle and thread and sewed it together also now have salmon colored streaks on that cushion which is not pretty i returned the product for a full refund,137,137
334,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i havint used it yet but you can tell from looking at the kit that it is going to be the right choice i know it will not be 100 but it is going to prolong and save a 1000 replacement corvette car seat for a few more years I have been shopping along time and am happy to have found this,60,138
335,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,i bought this product to try to fix and conceal several small holes in my cars leather seating it really did a pretty poor job the holes are still pretty noticable i was able to get a goodmatch i also tried the product on some minor scratches on a leather chair that application worked much better overall the product is probably better suited for scratches than holes or rips and make sure to go light on your colors because you do not have much white to play around with to lighten your mixture up you will also need many more alcohol wipes than are provided in the kit,109,139
336,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,do not bother with this kit you get one tiny piece of backing and one small piece of leather i opened the glue and could not figure out why it would not squeeze out finally pried off the top to find that the entire bottle had already dried up and i had just opened it for the first time definitely not worth it,62,140
337,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i recently bought used leather couches there was a cut in the leather and this product helped make it disappear the couch cost over 1450 new i got it for 170 plus this product looks great,36,141
338,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,this product is fantastik i bought it with no much hopes to repair my husbands reclinable arm chair he use the chair to sleep because he has health problems this leather chair was damage in various areas i am amazed how easy were the instructions and all the process the final result a reclinable arm chair like new i recommend it without reserve,63,142
339,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,it is junk did not work at all had to throw it away complete waste of money,15,143
340,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the glue works well on leather it is bendable and seems to hold well because i am not a professional thedoes not exactly match it is very hard to get it to match completely as a result it looks a bit unevenly colored and unevenly textured after i spent lots of time trying you can still tell there was a problem in the car seat but the cut is held together so the problem is fixed but it does not look great,79,144
341,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,i was a bit skeptical at first but i have to say this product delivered i had vintage style aged leather that had become a bit worn in some areas and had cracks that began to open in others and was able to repair them with this product the repairs are not invisible but they are satisfactory by far for the price of this kit,65,145
342,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,ok i was allready to go with this stuff then i tried to use the adhesive it got jammed as i was squeezing it out so i popped off the little nozzle and applied through the larger hole in the jug then the whole jug of adhesive got hard there goes the adhesive so i used some of my own adhesive right now i am letting the leather patch dry but i am not hopeful waste of 3000 use that money for somebody to fix it for real,88,146
343,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,i spent a lot of time looking for the perfect patch kit then gave up and decided to start cheap this one it worked perfectly yes you can tell there was once a hole if you look very carefully but nobody is going to casually notice it my couch is black so thematching was not a problem i imagine light colored leather such as beige or brown would be quite difficult to match with this kit edit about 6 months later the patch came off I am not sure it was the fault of the kit although because i did not have enough room to fit a properly-sized patch,108,147
344,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,I am reviewing this product as what it is a product for do-it-yourself non-professional types i would not expect the repair to be completely unnoticeable using that standard I have given this five stars positives the instructions are excellent particularly the very detailedmixing instructions plenty of colors of compound are provided ensuring that the correctcan be mixed also i will be able to use this kit again if necessary although I shall need to provide my own patch next time the materials are easy to work with if directions are followed now this does not look perfect on my leather chair we had a large rip about 4 inches i can see where the rip is but our chair is a burgundy textured leather neither thenor the texture is uniform so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather but it looks pretty good certainly way better than a rip it is not immediately noticeable if you are not looking for it for the price i paid about 25 this is a fantastic way to repair leather at home I have uploaded some photos of the repair,197,148
345,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,4.0,positive,the instructions were a bit confusing but i still managed an invisible repair on quite a large tear i definitely saved me from having to buy a new sofa for awhile I had recomend it but do read all the instructions through to be sure you use the product correctly,49,149
346,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,these products are difficult to use especially if you have little to no experience my results were awful the product may yield a good result but you absolutely have to know what you are doing this is not a good system for the novice,44,150
347,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,do not buy this product state of the art materials include a scrap of fabric that is not the shape of the hole some rubbing alcohol a piece of 220 sandpaper and not enough filling compound to complete the project with a beige sofa you need plenty of white but that container was half empty when i got it save your money and your time leather magic leather repair kit,70,151
348,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,product was too dried out to be usable received refund from amazon thank you,14,152
349,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,5.0,positive,used it to repair a leather couch worked great very satisfied,11,153
350,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,1.0,negative,does not go on as easy as it states also not enough white material to fit in 2 holes 1inch but 5 inch colors do not mix to match the chart shown,30,154
351,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0002Q6362,2.0,negative,adhesive and vinyl compounds were already hardened and unusable could not use the product,14,155
465,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,i used full page t-shirt transfers before and they seemed wasteful when the image is small it is good to have smaller size transfers for small projects followed the instructions and it worked well,33,0
466,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,i used these to put my book cover on a baseball cap the sleeves of several sweatshirts and a couple of teeshirts they work great easy transfer great colors and did not fade in the wash,35,1
467,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,this particular product has the wrong instruction sheet inside and caused me to damage my photos product probably would not have been so difficult if the directions inside the box were correct,32,2
468,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,this smaller sized sheet of transfer medium is handy i use it primarily when i design and print labels for my quilts on it,24,3
469,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,these work well for what they are like any other t-shirt transfer they need to be cut closely to the image to make them look decent they wear well we used them for a company event but after about 15 washes they are starting to peel off a bit,49,4
470,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,these work great for small projects just try and cut out as closely as you can to your design so it does not look ironed on at home they do also tend to crease and fade over time so take care when washing if it is something you really care about,49,5
471,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,well as other reviewers have stated the instructions are completely wrong it is like they are not even written for this product i suggest that you go to the avery site and download the correct instructions for this product I am giving this 2 start because most people would not think to look at the reviews to get the correct instructions they would simply do as i did and attempt the instructions that came with the product that will not work at all if you follow the correct instructions from the avery site you will have a nice outcome with a pretty nice transfer it comes out pretty soft and bright not sticky like some transfers I have used in the past I have washed the shirt i made a few times inside out and it still looks almost like it did right after i made it,140,6
472,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,these were awesome easy to use and fun to make for gifts family members avery products are first class always,20,7
473,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,as mentioned already the company screwed up completely on the directions took me 10 minutes of trying to separate the transfer sheet to figure this out once you know how to apply these they are actually very nice iron-ons I have made a few shirts for my 5-year old daughter who absolutely loves them I have also transferred images onto bibs for my youngest daughter amazingly they have lasted quite a long time over several washings they begin to wrinkle a bit but as long as you dry them on low they will last a while my wife accidentally dried one shirt on normal and the transfer ended up wrinkling a bit and looked like it had been through a dozen washings considering we have bought shirts from stores that have lasted less time I am very happy with these,133,8
474,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,i liked the 4x6 sheet size because i often print smaller-size images to iron-on to t-shirts and find I have wasted half the page i found it did not peel easily after being ironed on which is always a plus avery has a high-quality product and if you are interested in making your own t-shirts matching aprons for a cooking or gardening club or memory quilts custom onesies would make a perfect baby shower gift great rainy-day activity to help kids design images on the computer and print out for an adult to iron on,92,9
475,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,as many reviewers have pointed out the instructions included for this product are ridiculous i have tested this product on several white t-shirts have not done any dark the actual use once i figured it out was fairly easy this was not a problem the real problem came in after a few wears and washes of the three shirts i have made i would say each have been worn and washed 3 or 4 times on all but one of them the image has already started to crack apart and peel it could be that i did something wrong but given the abysmal included instructions i called the help line and followed their directions exactly so my conclusion is this product needed a little more work before releasing it to the public,132,10
476,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,i had read the reviews of this product before purchasing so i was well aware that the directions included with the product were entirely wrong and disregarded them thankfully users had posted better instructions and i was able to figure it out on my own for the most part I have only used this on white cotton t-shirts and although it is easy to apply especially since i do not really care if it ruins our garage sale iron the images have been breaking apart on the t-shirt material since this is the main reason why i purchased the product the use of it has become null to me I am not willing to she shall out more money for nice t-shirts that I shall probably just ruin so these transfers will probably just go in a drawer somewhere in my house never to be used again,142,11
477,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,really there is not much else to say it printed beautifully in my ink jet and transfered easily onto the garment fun product to use to create some original presents and more would deffinitely buy again,35,12
478,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,all you have to do is print the design you want and you are able to iron on the transfer works great only photo size so if you want a larger picture get bigger than 4x6,35,13
479,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,i always have a few packets of t-shirt transfers and some new t-shirts for impromptu projects i mainly use these to entertain kids making team 1 and team 2 items to add to a theme event bridal shower toss pillow covers or other random temporary projects as with most print-yourself iron-on transfers the background is slightly shiny and non-stretchable and fades after several vigorous washings themust be removed and lightly rinsed again by hand to avoid colour / print transfer to another part of the t-shirt in other words do not leave the printed shirt sitting wet too long in the machine after washing as with items in this genre this is purely a temporary in the momentfor something that lasts i would recommend using the many professional printing services both online and brick and mortar my one major complaint is that the instructions are incorrect avery put the instructions for a different product in the packing do not peel the transfer off the backing before printing,168,14
480,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,transfer stickes for t shirts have always been a great way to produce great gifts for party attendants specially for kids birthday parties and to have an uniform look for family or group travel this stickes work great and i did not burn any transfering to t shirts only drawback is size may be a little small for large t shirts adult x and xx sizes,66,15
481,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,i used these to make transfers for aprons for my family for our holiday family reunion they are really easy to use and were a huge hit with my family i washed mine in cold water in the gentle cycle drying on the lowest setting and there was no real loss of detail orjust be sure to use a vibrant photo or image to transfer to insure that you get a quality image,75,16
482,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,I have used avery transfers for inkjet printers before instead of having t-shirts printed for employees who come and go and mistreat the ones I have bought and had screen-printed i have often opted to print our logo with these transfers i think this latest batch i got is slightly more resistant to fading in the washing / drying process i suppose I shall know better a month or two from now but so far they seem better same good performance as far as inkaccuracy and consistently even transfer of image two months later the images i printed continue to wear well through the laundry process the two concerns anyone may have about using these transfers have now both been put to rest for me the image is intense and evenly printed the image stays that way much more than it would have with previous editions of the transfer try some,149,17
483,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,this photo transfer paper works great i am not using it for t-shirts but the wife wanted to start a memory quilt i took several photos that i had archived and using this paper printed them from my canon printer the iron on transfer to the cloth she is using went perfectly and she is extremely happy with the results it looks as if i will be ordering quite a bit more of this so she can finish her quilt,80,18
484,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4.0,positive,these are great for my 3 year olds t-shirts they fit perfectly on the shirts and i do not have problems with them often i had one that was hard to get the sheet off the shirt but i honestly do not know if i just did not push hard enough or iron it for long enough so i can not say it was not my fault although nothing is ever my fault ask my 12 year old laughing out loud I had buy these definitely,78,19
485,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,there were a lot of problems with this product first of which were the directions that were completely baffling the other was the product itself there were problems with printing it on my printer then with tranferring it on the shirt and then with washing i would not recommend this product it was too much of a hassle to work with and poor intstructions,64,20
486,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,as others have posted trying to follow the directions that come with these is mind boggling after several attempts to figure it out i actually came to amazon to see the reviews and found i was not alone my wife is an art teacher and usally can figure things like this out much better than me so she will be playing with thiese next all i want to do is make a custom t-shirt for my 4 year old it should not be this confusing,84,21
487,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,it did not even work in the printer went in came out did not do anything just got new printer will test it and update review if a success but from the looks of it it probably will not be the directions it says avery dark fabric transfer tips what about light colors and the directions from there on are shabby as in they are muddled I am not even sure the directions in the package are even correct the only plus i can see so far is the support line a support line for t-shirt transfers is not it supposed to be easy,97,22
488,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5.0,positive,great mission accomplished made a nice graduation gift,8,23
489,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,i usually do not write bad reviews but this was such a disappointment and a waste of money i used it to put images on two white cotton onesies it says right on the package ideal for childrens clothes the transfer attached the white backing to the shirt as well as the image unlike other light t-shirt transfers I have used in the past but i figured it would be ok nope after one wearing i rinsed them both in cold water in the sink and the ink ran terribly nearly all the red just washed right off ugh but still I am not wasting onesies so i just dropped them in the wash after only one wash with the rest of the baby clothes the transfer is ripping and torn and looks like garbage this is the worst iron-on transfer I have ever used avery you let me down,147,24
490,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,this product is junk i only use jet pro soft stretch this stuff cracks and the colors are not nearly as nice as the jet pro you do have to use an actual heat press with the jpss although,39,25
491,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,to me it was difficult i made mistakes a lots the print came out after washing may be iron was not enough,22,26
492,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2.0,negative,i love customizing things fabric is no exception so when these popped up i was sure to grab them i was discouraged upon attempting to do my first transfer because the instructions made no sense in fact they were completely incorrect the instructions say that the transfers are for dark fabrics but the sheets say for light fabrics after eventually getting this to work i found out that that you can not dry the fabrics on anything other than low which is fine with me i dry everything on low to keep them soft they are really no better than any other iron on transfers i will not be purchasing these again but if avery comes out with a new and improved transfer i will consider it hopefully they have taken all of these reviews to heart,133,27
493,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,some of the pens exploded and got ink everywhere so i had to return them they also felt very cheaply made in my hand like they would snap if i held them too tightly so i did not purchase another pack,41,0
494,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,all but one of the pens work well one of the purple pens is unfortunately already dried out the triangular shape makes for easy storage and allows for a better more comfortable grip,33,1
495,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,fine product good transaction a couple of pens seemed a little dry otherwise i would have rated the product 5 stars overall happy with the purchase,26,2
496,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,so disappointed in these markers one was completely dry two barely work several are scratchy and one broke apart the first time i uncapped it and ink got all over the place i feel like i got a different set of markers than those in all the reviews i read before purchasing i will never buy these again,58,3
497,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,love this i use this for my planner to doodle u have alot of different colors to play with it does not bleed through paper,26,4
498,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i bought these to go along with a coloring book of very intricate mandalas so i needed pens or markers that could handle the tiny details of the pictures the fine tips on these pens are fantastic and the colors do not bleed out through the paper plenty of different colors to choose from as well good purchase,57,5
499,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,this is the 3rd batch of markers i received 2day where all the blue ones are dried out weird i guess I am not supposed 2 use blue laughing out loud,28,6
500,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,they work ok they came in fast like 2 or 3 of the pin did not work,17,7
501,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,i got these because they were cheap artist inkers and i wanted to test them out i open the case to find out that the pens were dryed out the tips on some broke off and the caps insides fall apart i say do not ever buy these because they will waste your money,53,8
502,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,tips were broken and several were dried up,8,9
503,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,bought them as a gift recipient was very pleased,9,10
504,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,got these for college went to work on my homework and the grey and light yellow does not work i have not used all the colors yet but now i have to order new ones not happy,37,11
505,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i ordered 2 of these for christmas gifts only some of the pens worked i was past the return date so stuck with them the ones that worked are great,30,12
506,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,first off these are fine tipped markers not pens secondly I have never experienced drawing with something that does not remotely match theof the cap it is like a surprise every time the light colors are dark the five different greens are all roughly the samethe yellows are orange or green and they have run out quickly on the plus side the case is nice and i like the triangular shape and the price was cheap,76,13
507,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,the colors are all vibrant 1 of the markers may have had abut after inspecting each and every single one i could not find d it but oh well i love them,33,14
508,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love these i wish i had found them sooner thy arrived before the date that was given i use them for school and also for coloring I have had them for over a month and all the colors are still vibrant and i have not had any issues with the ink not drying fast enough,54,15
509,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,very disappointing these are not thethat the cap says they are at all,15,16
510,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,mis-advertised these are in no way shape or form gel pens they are markers they have fine points and work well as markers but they are not gel pens which is what i was expecting when i ordered them markers can not be blended no glitter and all the colors are extremely dark would not order again,56,17
511,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,nice colors and good for details but i did break the tip of one already by applying too much pressure,20,18
512,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,they have an incredibly cheap feel and are not gel as advertised i will be returning them,17,19
513,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,half of these are already dried out plus the colors do not match lids i picked up a yellow one and thewas deep orange,25,20
514,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i really liked the pens they were nice for a while i used them only for a school year if that is a while but some of the colors dry out faster than others once a pen has been bent or split there has no going back that was the only sad part about these pens,54,21
515,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these are a very nice fine tipped pen work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in there are plenty of colors but i did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper there was only 1 pen that i had any issue with and it was a light green which did not bother me that much since i do not use a lot of the lighter green colors but by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let thedrop and i have not had any issue since the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing the colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you will not lose them anywhere i am attaching a copy of a picture that i am working on right now using these pens for the linework the wording is done with a marker i received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review,203,22
516,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i bought these to use for adult coloring books and a lot of people end up using colored pencils but i wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick is a great variety of colors and it is very sharp clear bright pigmentation I had recommend this to anybod so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book I am not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I shall probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23
517,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i like the colors but when i received them one of the pen exploded and was a mess,18,24
518,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i like the fine line it draws however three of the markers were dried up before i even got to use them disappointing and i probably will not buy their product again,32,25
519,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these are nice pens very fine point they are great for tiny details however they do not blend well when you fill something in you can see each individual line each time you cover over the same area it gets darker due to the fine tip i would not recommend for anything larger however they are great colors and nice quality,61,26
520,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,good set of coloring pens but colors are not as bright as i thought they would be,16,27
521,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,nice pens i wanted a fine line marker to use with my silhouette machine for drawing and writing sentiments these worked perfect they have a pretty good range of colors the nibs are nice and strong also and draw a nice fine line,43,28
522,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,unfortunately these claimed to be gel pens when i purchased them they were not they are fine point markers had i wanted fine point markers these would been marvelous but not what i wanted mis-marked not what i was looking for no good for adult coloring books,45,29
523,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,when i received these 3 had leaked since then quite a few more have also love the ones that are useable,21,30
524,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,tiny markers but not gel pens useful but not what i expected,12,31
525,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these were pretty good markers they are fine tip and theydecently some colors are basically the same shade but other than that i had no problem they arrived quickly and I have had them for almost a year now,39,32
526,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,there has only one shade of red which is sad but a billion pinks and greens so that makes up for it,21,33
527,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,one of the pens blew up when i first used it i had to throw it away,17,34
528,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,great but one of the pens was leaking in the package when we got it,15,35
529,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,this pens i like so well the way thebut the tips on them do not last i used this set of pens twice and already i had to throw one away because of a bad tip and could not get any ink out and other one has a bad tip on it i was in the middle of a picture when it went bad i was very displeased,69,36
530,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,they come apart when you take the top off to use them a waste of money,16,37
531,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these pens are great the ink is the sameas the lid of each pen,16,38
532,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,pensall of them my teen is covered in ink,12,39
533,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i ordered these to use on my ultra-intricate adult coloring books definitely a fine point works very well on tiny areas i recommend some larger or broader markers for bigger areas as these leave a rough texture to the paper when used toa larger space,47,40
534,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,very scratchy so i ended up giving them to my grandchildren i will not purchase again,16,41
535,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these fineliner gel sketch markers are of a very high quality and have nice bold colors the markers come in a wide array of colors in a reusable plastic container I have only had one markersince I have begun using them they are excellent for mixed media projects mandala colorings zen tangle journaling deconstructing books grocery lists i would not recommend them for huffing nor would they assist you in mentally cleaning out your fridge that is all,77,42
536,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i use these for coloring and they are great products the only down side is that the ink dries out a little too quickly so i have to tap the pen and move the ink around to help the flow,40,43
537,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,i was so excited for these pens to comes in and they worked great at first but i have not even finished coloring one page in my coloring book and my dark brown marker is dying i made sure to cap all my pens properly but it is still dying i expect pens to last more than a day,58,44
538,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,many of the colors appear very differently on paper than what you expect based on theof the cap,20,45
539,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,I am a teacher and i love my office supplies i could not wait to try these out they are definitely fine point and there was no running or bleeding as i drew colored and wrote with them i love the variety of colors that come in the pack as well i am excited to use them very similar to the rong thai fine point markers i tried them in a coloring book and because the pages are thick it did not bleed through but not sure i would use them for coloring i did receive this product to try out and review,99,46
540,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,love these got an adult coloring book and these work great for all those little details in those pictures i highly recommend these and can not beat the price also got them quicker than expected so that was nice,38,47
541,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,love these markers perfect for small details they write like pens and the colors are great,16,48
542,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,several of the markers do not workis not in the tip,10,49

544,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love the container of these fineliner pens and the 24 colors are good although a couple of them are pretty close in tone to another still a good set for tiny spaces in adult coloring books,37,51
545,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,not good for adult coloring books they do not glide very well scratchy / dry might be better served for signing signatures or writing text but for coloring in you do not get a consistent fill some places are darker than others and those dark places bleed through was looking to try a new brand to diversify my range of colors i typically use stabilo but unfortunately will have to keep looking,70,52
546,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i love these pens i find that they do bleed through most paper unless it is a very heavy weight paper the colors are vibrant and i use them all the time,32,53
547,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these are the right pens to use with adult coloring books after trying pencils and coloring brush pens i found these work in the tight places the best i tried all of them to see if any were dried up and all were good true toas well you need to replace the lids so they snap on tight to keep them from drying up,66,54
548,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,these just arrived in the mail and at least one of them leaked as they are all covered in a bluish-purple ink theappears new as the blue is all over my hands now as well,37,55
549,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these pens are really awesome i used them when i was studying for my exams because i like for my notes to be colorful and organized my only problem was that a few of them dried out or ran out of ink very quickly i had hardly even used them it was only two or three in the pack that did this and the others still work great,68,56
550,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,using these for my adult coloring books and they are wondeful several coworkers plan to purchase the same product for their coloring books as well,25,57
551,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,terrible absolutely terrible 75 if them are dry they do not fill well very blotchy what an total waste of money,22,58
552,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,they are great for really tiny spaces but when it comes to bigger spaces you really have to take your sweet time,22,59
553,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,i recently bought these pens i have used them three times and four of them are already dry waste of money,21,60
554,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,i like the flow of these pens and they only barely bleed through a quality coloring book however the dark green was leaking from the bottom of the pen and was already all over the other pens when it arrived I am sure this was a fluke also for 24 colors a lot of these colors are so similar that it is like I am using the same colors over and over i would have liked more variety in the pack,78,61
555,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,nice markers lots of colors to choose from,8,62
556,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i ordered these to use in an adult coloring book they work perfectly for the extra fine lines that are in the book they do bleed through just a tiny bit so i have a piece of paper in between my pages they do not bleed through the lines for me like other markers did i can be very precise definitely recommend for any coloring or drawing that needs fine detail,70,63
557,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these pens are awesome i got them for coloring in adultbooks they are amazing for small areas,19,64
558,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,very good purchase the price was super they arrived on time prerfectly packed the colors are just as shown in the caps,22,65
559,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,received yesterday but why it is so dirty so dirty i required a new one for my friends gift i am very unsatisfied with this,26,66
560,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,returnedpens were dry after about 30 seconds of use,11,67
561,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,really goodmarkers bc they do not bleed through paper and write better than gel pens,16,68
562,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,they are a very fine point and run out of ink before a project can be completed,17,69
563,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,cheaply made and the there is a inkproblem,10,70
564,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,great pens nice thin tip to make smaller details to handwriting or journaling if you love colored pens or office supplies like me these are amazing,26,71
565,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,the pens were all leaking when i got them so i sent them back for a refund,17,72
566,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,horrible ink flow is blotchy and uneven and the tips of some of the pens are slightly frayed and too hard to make a nice smooth layer ofalso these are listed as pinkrise and they are plinrise for some unknown reason if you have arthritis or fibromyalgia the caps can be difficult to remove the triangular shape is pleasing to the hands although,65,73
567,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,some pens were already dry and unusable very disappointing got much better pens at michaels,16,74
568,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love to write and draw and i am always on the lookout for some great pens and markers i am so glad i got these pinkrise office colored fineliner sketch drawing pen fine point gel ink pen ink width 04mm set of 24 assorted colors they are very nice and come in a plastic case that seals nicely so when you are done you can put them away very neatly and not lose any of them and they write just wonderfully i am very picky about my pens and markers but could not find anything negative about these i absolutely love them i was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion i am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way i am just a regular amazon customer who shops a lot on amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision,157,75

572,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,disappointed that some of the markers came dry,8,79
573,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,i love these markers i was worried about the quality and the price but identification buy them again i love them i was impressed with the size since i wanted extremely small markers and these nailed it,37,80
574,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,the lid and the actualdid not always match but i just made achart in the flap of the book for comparison loved the markers over all,29,81
575,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,markers bleed all over my hands they run out of ink right after one use I am completely disappointed i would give them zero stars if there was an option for that i wish i could get my money back,41,82
576,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,was delivered very quickly the colors are great and the pens do not bleed across the page very pleased and would recommend to others,24,83
577,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,the triangular shape makes these easy to hold i like a finer tip but for what they are they are good,21,84
578,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted no problems with dried pens nice variety of colors super fast shipping i received my set 2 days after i ordered it happy with my purchase,30,85
579,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,not only are they dried up and yes i did shake them and wait a while to use them but some of the tips are split down the middle the colors on the caps are not even close to what the actual ink comes out,45,86
580,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,these are great for very detailed drawings the ink seems to stay consistent even after prolonged use also the barrel is triangular rather than round i found it a little awkward at first but it certainly did not cause any issues these would be a great gift for an artist or other creative type maybe paired with an art book regarding shipping i have prime and it arrived within 2 days,70,87
581,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,these pens work well but they run out of ink sooner than other brands,14,88
582,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,half the markers were dried out upon arrival waste of money,11,89
583,Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,really disappointing as a noise reducer no noticeable difference does diffuse the exhaust really not worth it,17,0
584,Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,does not block sound that much but it does reduce dust fits shop vacs,13,1
585,Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,thought i was looking for a filter but turned out it was a missing muffler on a friends wet dry vacuum did the job and returned to my friend with added bonus because she did not know it was missing,39,2
586,Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,this installs easily on the rigid vacuum exhaust port but that is about the only good thing about it it is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it i could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not it is a goodbut really does not work too well,60,3
587,Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,this product being advertised as a muffler is misleading i observed no difference in sound level i just completed my test it is being returned an effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac this is a viable option for my use since i will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective,77,4
588,Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,the listing for this muffler does not say what size hose it fits there are three sizes when i received it i realized it did not fit my vacuum,27,5
589,Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,my ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106db at 3 feet according to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a dead kennedys concert the muffler reduces that to 105 so maybe a wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler further using an unscientific stick to your face test I had say it reduces suction by about 15 so basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac if you need that and do not want to just tape a sock to the outlet click buy immediately i finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet now i can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her f-16,124,6
590,Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,it is a muffler makes the shop vac quiet stays in place does not stick out too far one two three four,20,7
591,Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,i did not need exhaust dispersion if i did i would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device to my knowledge none exist i wanted a muffler this does not muffle i took it back the end ps this site will not allow my zero star rating,45,8
592,Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,this not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine does not blow air all over from the back of the machine it is a great addition for very little money we were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list,50,9
593,Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,i was surprised to see that this muffler received 4 stars when i read the reviews praise was given not because it muffles sound but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust indeed this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my ridgid vacs i bought two of them but i was in a rush and got them locally when we are working on a job site there often is lots of dust imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in it also spreads the dust over an even greater area as other reviewers describe this muffler oh why not just call it air-diffuser redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle this greatly reduces the force of the air it is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler but the difference is too small to spend any money on so in terms of living up to it is name i give it one star,190,10
594,Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,this little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac the name is rather misleading as it was not designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction,40,11
595,Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,if you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place if you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust this is what you need it can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust,44,12
596,Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,this is definitely not a noise muffler it is not a silencer either it does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face by redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable i bought this for our new ridgid wd1680 which amazon does not sell the big box store i bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so i got this to go with it used in a garage the vac is surprisingly quiet it seems our hoover upright is much louder i measured the ridgid as-is at 83db with the muffler on it was 83db there was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant i figure it is also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I am going to return it the wd1680 also works as a removeable blower in that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port even although it was the same port with just a tube attachment so bottom line is that this is useless,182,13
597,Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart this really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern and also diffusing it with some very porous foam vacuum performance is not hindered it is not really a muffler as the noise level did not change for me but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying it should really come with the vacuum but since it does not its a no brainer purchase,82,14
598,Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,i bought thisfor the rigid shop vac with detachable blower basically the same unit as the sears craftsman version it makes a noticable difference in reducing the frequency of the sound thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit although i can not say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter i do not have a db meter it certainly makes it seem quieter and much more bearable you do have to watch where you point it although because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction although this is by design it is the blower port after all also it not fully inserted it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on worth the money,130,15
599,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,perfect for what i needed see behind without turning around check on skier or tuber or to see approaching boat from rear clear enough for all that and secures tightly so no vibrations,33,0

602,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,i liked having this mirror and it was inexpensive but it was also cheap the piece for mounting it broke off within a couple of months and that is with minimal use it was a disappointment,35,3
603,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,this was rather difficult to install on my boat i also found out that it does not meet the requirements for acceptable mirrors in texas by the us coast guard,29,4
604,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,simple mirror that gets the job done and you get your monies worth the reflective part is plastic so it is not as clear but it is certainly more durable than glass you may need to put a shim so it fits to you windshield,44,5
605,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,it works fine you get what you pay for the key word for this product is economy,17,6
606,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,out boat does not have a attached side mirror and when we have the top on our big attached mirror does not fit this mirror is so prefect for that and it is way cheaper than other i found love it,41,7
607,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,nice mirror easy on and off for 10 you can not go wrong a-zon to my house in two days,16,8
608,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,face it you do not want to pay 129 for an overtons mirror but you still want to see behind you this works mount is good as well took me a minute to figure it out and needs tightened every once in a while mirror with a few imperfections but certainly good enough view to see if a skier or tuner is on or off and to see hand signals if you have read this far just spend the ten bucks and move on you will be happy,87,9
609,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,universal mount will not work on my sea ray had to jury rig,12,10
610,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,flimsy cheap mirror that has an extremely distorted view not worth the pricether,13,11
611,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,mounting bracket is too large for average windshield thickness used a block of wood to fill theotherwise it is great for the price if you are looking for something stylish this is not what you want it is as cheap as it is price but will do the job just fine,51,12
612,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,excellent for what i needed the top left was distorted a bit although,13,13
613,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,the thumb screw does not work that great i ended up drilling a few pilot holes in my plastic windshield on my boat and used rubber washers and a nut to fasten works great now,34,14
614,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,arrived without the mounting bracket overall poor quality do not try and save the on this cheap product,18,15
615,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,i was looking for an inexpensive rearview mirror for my boat to keep track of any boat traffic behind me since i use my boat on a lake with a lot of traffic using the mirror does not preclude looking behind me when changing direction however i do like keep track of boats which may be overtaking me this mirror is very inexpensive easy to install and provides an adequate if somewhat distorted wide-angle view of what has behind my boat,80,16
616,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for it is a reflective sticker on a cheap plastic base not the greatest mirror but for the price it will work,26,17
617,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,your basic plastic mirror meets expectations for the price,9,18

646,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,it is more of a shiny piece of plastic sticker than anything else it does get the job done tho as functioning as a rear view mirror still would have preferred some sort of plexi or tempered glass,37,47

663,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,mirror part not exactly high grade lens material but for a budget purpose does the job seems to screw into place securely and is the right size and seems solid enough we always have more than one person in the boat if we are towing someone so this was more to be legal in case we ever wanted to have just driver and person being towed and for the driver to be able to peak on their own without relying on the other passenger so this fits our needs well enough in spite of the lack of crisp visual it is ok to good not good to great,106,64
664,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,price is good not a glass mirror made of plastic hopefully holds up,13,65
665,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,the clarity of view seems fine to me but it could definitely have a larger view the problem for me is that i can not find a way to securely mount it yet it will not tighten up enough to fit any standard ski boat windshield that i have seen surely with a little more creativity i can make a spacer to take up all the space but i should not have to modify a product to fit a boat it is marketed to fit would not buy again,87,66
666,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,i would not put this on a jon boat straight to the trash,12,67
667,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,works as described i use it in my cubicle to see when people sneak up on me,18,68

672,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,needs to be at least 4 wide and long,9,73
673,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,there are fancier models of this mirror but for an affordable price it is easy to attach the the windshield of a boat i use my mirror to help to watch skiers as well a see what is going on behind me in general if money was no object you may want to consider a higher-end model with suction cup mount and more i opted for this because my boats windows are tinted and i did not want to stick a suction cup the window tint I have hit this with my head a few times and it has not broken the build quality is okay but i doubt that it could withstand extended abuse I am happy with my purchase and the price paid for this mirror it helps to makes my boating experience more safe on a budget,135,74
674,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,4.0,positive,this is a very universal clamp on cheapy but does the job i had to make a block to take up the space to elliminate the rattle otherwise works great,30,75
675,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,cheap and blurry but what i expected for the price does mount easily buy metal or glass for clear visibility,20,76
676,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,just what we needed for our kawasaki mule utv now we can see what is coming up behind us easy attachment,21,77
677,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,2nd one i ordered the slightest bump and it is broken i put a new one in my boat on saturday 7/13 and i bumped it on sunday 7/14 it broke,31,78
678,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,5.0,positive,I am not sure why it took me so long to order one of these not only is it required when skiing with only two people but it is hugely convenient do not hesitate to buy one they are a great asset on a boat,43,79
679,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,1.0,negative,tried to save a buck you get what you pay for the clamp actually popped itself off as soon as i mounted it,22,80
680,Automotive,B0000AY3DS,2.0,negative,this is really a pretty cheapounfortunately it does not quite fit over the windshield of my boat also the only way to tighten it onto the windshield is with the provided screws it really seems like there should be a foam covered plate between the screws and the surface to prevent scratching the surface I am using it but actively seeking a better alternative,64,81
710,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,these husky liners will save your carpet and nice mats i have 3 kids in school and these have saved my interior,22,0
711,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,I have had these for nearly 5 months they look and perform well i think they are overpriced for what they are worth 25 for the pair not 45 plus my biggest complaint is that they emit a chemical off-gassing smell i am not sure why cheap plastic but they still give my car an off oder after nearly 5 months of use it is particularly bad on sunny days when parked car heats up avoid unless you do not mind chemically oder,81,1
712,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,more than adequate will protect the carpet during the winter quite well,12,2
713,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,these require trimming to fit so they are not completely custom but they are very easy to trim and fit our 2002 subaru legacy outback just fine the only down side and hence one star off is that there is no molded in socket for the pin which keeps the mat from sliding around i did cut one but it does not seem to hold it in position that well,69,3
714,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,nice mats fit well into my 2002 a4,8,4
715,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,these mats does not fit bmw 525i the mat is actually on thepedal it is just too wide on the drivers side and that is not safe,27,5
716,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,i purchased these mats to replace the ones i have had for over 10 years i purchased a new vehicle and i wanted ato match the interior the drivers side mat did not fit properly on my toyota 4 runner after cutting where indicated there was aof at least an inch between theof the mat and the side door as it was winter i could already see the floor carpet getting dirty i cut the mat further in the upper left corner to better accommodate the foot rest and the problem is resolved but it does not look right with the ridge cut away my old ones fit perfectly and i was expecting the same from the new mats,124,6
717,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,the floor mats are super durable and a real breeze to modify if needed to your particular car or truck,20,7
718,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,driver side can be cut to fit passenger side is a little to wide and can not be cut to fit so not quite custom fit,26,8
719,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,needs to be cut to fit look bad wanted to surprise my daughter by replacing very old carpet mats the really look so bad i may not leave them in the car,32,9
720,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,these are not custom fit you cut them with scissors and they sort of fit not that impressive the back ones are dual non-fitting landcruiser has a single piece go with weathertech,32,10
721,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,update i contacted husky about these mats and the poor fit in my toyota highlander outstanding customer service engineer admitted these are more of a general purpose mat and not specifically designed for one model of vehicle instead he shipped me the cargo liner mats which are custom molded to cover the entire floor in front of the driver and passenger the custom fit liners are far better if you drive a highlander or larger vehicle choose the custom liner and skip this mat original review i drive a 2006 highlander and was happy to see that my specific model was listed unfortunately these floor mats are anything but vehicle specific the husky website tells you that they will require trimming and even after doing so the driver side mat does not fit correctly this is a safety hazard and i strongly recommend against this product save your monay and shop elsewhere,153,11
722,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,weathertech makes the digital fit for the 2004 tacoma but not the double cab i bought those mats from amazon because their fit guide said it would work when they did not sit right i went to their weathertechs site and learned that they do not make the mats for the double cab truck you can submit a product request on that site and tell them you want that this mat made once there are enough requests they will make it if you are buying these mats because you do not want to spend the 100 that weathertech charges then you may be satisfied if you have ever owned the wt mats these are no where near the fit since they were 60 of the cost of the wt mats I am not disappointed,128,12
723,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,very very pleased in these mats and they are heavy duty and nothing flimsy about these love them and recommend them,21,13
724,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,they really do catch all the dirt and slush perfect fit for my car too i matched them up with the center husky liner,24,14
725,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,the floor mats arrived on time and in very good condition the product was a perfect fit for my car and the quality of the rubber is very good,29,15
726,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,mat does not fit driver side is ok not worth returning but irritating and poor service when the type and make of car are carefully specified,26,16
727,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,i ordered these for my suv as mine had worn out so far they are working great i do like them and would recommend them to others,27,17
728,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,these are not fitted mats for your bmw 3 series they need to be cut trimmed and fitted to match the contours of your vehicles floor the product discription misleads one to belive these are custom fitted mats not one word about cutting and trimming for fitment if your considering buying these mats do yourself a favor and go to your local big box auto store and buy a set of 20 dollar generic mats as these are not worth 3x the cost,83,18
729,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,1.0,negative,mats were advertised to be custom fit they have to be cut down to size and do not fit at all this should have been explained in the product description,30,19
730,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,5.0,positive,these are great floor mats very durable stylish and easy to wash the crud off which is a big bonus here in the midwest with the harsh winters we have i would highly recommend,34,20
731,Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,I have had several husky heavy duty floor mats in the past i prefer the heavy duty to the hskey liners in the front as they are less slippery and thicker normally they fit great and last forever i bought this set for my 2004 tacoma double cab 1st gen the fit leaves something to be desired initially the drivers side was terrible but there are pattern lines for trimming it down after trimming with a razor it is a good fit I am not sure if this is for multiple models but i would prefer a fit out of the box the passenger side needs to be molded differently on the bottom left corner as it comes up over a bump in the floorboard colour is great match materials quality is great and I am sure they will last as long as my other huskys have just a bit disappointed in the passenger side fit it is not terrible by any means but not perfect as others have been driver side is perfect after trimming with a razor blade along the trim lines,179,21
732,Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,after hitting someand tearing up my front fender i decided to buy these to cover the damage they worked great and fit like a glove no sweat on the tape i just used clear silicone via caulk gun to attach nothing to it one thing to note these attach behind the front running lights via screws in other words you remove your front running lights then replace atop the fender covers back to the holes the screws in the kit were just a little short and not really up to the task i went to the auto store and purchased some stainless 8 screws with plenty of length to tighten up everything these look great on the jeep i also have real diamond plate installed and the guards matches just fine,133,0
733,Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,if you buy these you will need to trim these and take your time to make them fit correctly i had to use a dremel to shave down the sides for both sides to sit flush then i had to use a heat gun to heat them up and mold them to the fenders so they would sit right go to lowes or home depot and buy stainless steel screws the ones they provide will not work correctly you will want to use a pan head screw head size 8 and 1 long go to your local auto parts store and pick up a small roll of 3 m double sided tape has a red backing and the adhesive is a dark gray the provided tape will not be enough to hold it down right overall not a terrible product but for a 50 molded piece of plastic i would have expected it to fit better,154,1
734,Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,the front is much easier than the back lights come out easily and the fit is pretty good i read a review that said it did not come with new screws and the ones you take out of your lights are not long enough i did not see any when looking at the parts so i went and bought some but later when cleaning up i found a little bag with 4 black screws in it and taped to another bag the parts came in never saw that laughing out loud i assume these were for that but i did the front and backs at the same time so can not swear to it again instructions would have been nice they look great,117,2
735,Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,neat product adds to my black and white only look thre is a slight problem with the driver side guard as it doenst want to lay flat other then that I am happy with them,34,3
736,Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,applied these per instructions the double stick tape should be a little thicker to really catch the body better so it stays put i actually added some of mine to it so it would stay product does what it is supposed to protects corners and is stylish,46,4
737,Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,purchased body armor guards to cover some paint chips and prevent more they do that but the adhesive does not stick and really is only being held on by the parking light screws even the screw holes had to be enlarged to line up they do not lay flat on fender goodshould come up with better adhesive,57,5
738,Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,these guards look great in the pictures but for the money they are way over priced here is a list of things that could be improved on these that i created while installing these 1 better tape I am not sure why rugged ridge skimped on the tape for these but after installing the left gard as per the instructions it literally popped off i went down to kragen and got the best 3 m tape they had and the guard fits flush just fine 2 quality control for 50 plus dollars i would consider these a disappointment the plastic was unevenly cut was thin in some areas particularly where the screrws go the mold might have been crooked because the screw holes were also a little uneven 3 heavier duty i know plastic is very strong but i was definitely disappointed with the weight and feel of the plastic as well considering the price for 20 dollars i doubt i would have said anything but for triple that and more on other websites i was pretty annoyed definitely considered returning them they do look nice once you get them on,189,6
739,Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,way over priced for a piece of thin plastic that attaches with tape,14,7
740,Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,looks good and easy to install had no problem with the screws that they came with but the tape is not very good quality a little too pricey but overall pretty good product,36,8
741,Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,upgraded the look of the front of my jeep,9,9

744,Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,adhesive sucks but buy new at the store and your set gives wrangler a good look,16,12
745,Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,cheap product double-sided adhesive is a joke i bought these to cover up the damage the old ones caused on a used jeep i recently purchased as per the previous owner i had to rivet them to the fenders just to keep it on rugged ridge clearly does not test their products and i do not know how they have stayed in business,61,13
746,Automotive,B000FQ033I,1.0,negative,i purchased knowing the price but i was expecting a harder more heavy duty plastic instead they are a thin cheap plastic and meant to be glue to the car with 3 m tape they are not meant for performance they are meant for looks do not expect them to stick great to the body unless you are willing to drill them down left side did not fit properly i decide to return them and next time i will spend the extra money and go with the real ones,82,14
828,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,these are yup you guessed it junk they are cheaply made i ripped two of mine trying to install them and they are not universal junk product do not buy these,30,0

830,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,i like these seat covers a lot i mainly got them to protect my light covered seats i did not really care for the colors but they are very useful the only thing i do not really like is that you have cut holes for the covers that go in the back for the seat belts,54,2
831,Automotive,B001TLITTI,5.0,positive,awesome totally transformed the look of my car tight fit,10,3
832,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,descriptions were for lexus-ls430 2006 but when i received the cover they are too small spend money to go to car dealer who were not able to put seats on also none of the covers had accommodating opening for my cay feafures,42,4

835,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,bought these for my niece and they are of good quality back seat covers harder to get on but that is the norm leather like material protects from liquid damage can not say how long they will she has only had them for three weeks if they hold up for a year we will be happy,56,7
836,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,these seat lovers are nice enough but the problem is that the backseat covers do not fit a 2014 toyota camry this camry has airbags in the rear that should not be covered,33,8
837,Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,these seat covers are pretty darn cool actually it was not that difficult to install at all the only complain is that it does not quite fit my back seats there is no opening in the seat cover for the center consul of the back seat,45,9
838,Automotive,B001TLITTI,5.0,positive,great product and makes my suv look brand new,9,10
839,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,very low quality said it fits and did not,8,11
840,Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,even being extremely careful and following exact instructions which are lacking greatly in detail they have ripped twice first set and then the replacement set and the 2nd set the primary strap that holds it in place broke great look great price but being gentle and careful when installing i would not buy again,53,12
841,Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,charles cummings the hidden man is certainly the finest espionage novel I have read while i love the works of littell deighton greene mccarry ignatius and le carre as well as cummings own a spy by nature the hidden man is unique in how effectively it deals with the effects of cold war espionage on very ordinary people the main characters in cummings novel are not spies ambassadors or diplomats but a businessman and an artist nor does cumming succumb to having them turn into james bond history simply reaches into their lives and unravels them even one is not interested in that particular theme one will be treated to a fast engrossing drama by page fifty cumming has amassed so much intruiging plot with remarkably little prose,127,0
842,Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,once you have read all of john laclare your man is c cumming you will thank me and devour his books keep them coming chuck and thanks for resurrecting the hidden man,32,1
843,Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,this is one of charles cummings early books which has only recently become available on us kindle it is a tense satisfying story of dysfunctional father-son and brother-brother relationships that become enmeshed in an mi5 investigation into a russian organized crime family as anyone who has ever read any of gerald seymours books knows whenever amateurs get involved in the world of espionage and organised crime the outcome is rarely a happy one you hope that they will emerge safely but deep down you know that they will not once you know that this is one of cummings early efforts you do feel that the degree of cynicism that comes through in his alec milius stories is still in it is early stages of development here but the way in which mi5 and mi6 fail to even talk to each other let alone cooperate and the fatal consequences this has feels all too real if this is one of cummings books you have not yet read then it is definitely worth your while filling in that,175,2
844,Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,although the plot suffers from too much coincidence and too much omniscience amongst the cast it is still a good read a bit of it is time but that is actually well done,32,3
845,Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,not his best i can see why this novel was not released prior it is not a fully developed suspense thriller probably cummings weakest to date,26,4
846,Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,i will never read another book by this author i will also be more selective in what i choose to read the ending ruins a fine novel of espionage brother ben a main character in totality simply disappears by the failure of the ending goodbye mr cumming,54,5
847,Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,a very cynical look into the british secret service but considering the time frame 2003 who could expect any less cc writes great books,24,6
848,Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,boring beyond words two bungling whining brothers spend more than five indeed pages whining about their father the murders spying plot have no motivation an unsatisfactory ending trash it,29,7
849,Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,i expected more from cumming this rehashing of an old novel is not worth the read there is a reason this book was never published in america until now it does not work,31,8
850,Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,highly disappointing not at all in the same league as some of his other books,15,9
851,Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,although i liked his two alec milius books fast-paced and easier to follow better all cummings spy thrillers are fun changes of pace his characters are always well-drawn and intriguing as he ably puts his everyman heroes in challenging situations this tale of two estranged sons seeking the truth of their hidden man dad leading to friction between the brothers as the russians more business than political spies here play divide and conquer satisfies,78,10
852,Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,cummings writes good solid mysteries and i like that enjoy reading his books,13,11
853,Books,0007487223,1.0,negative,the worst book i have purchased from amazon can i obtain a credit,14,12
854,Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,i had enjoyed other books by charles cumming bu this one was a big disappointment the plot felt contrived to me and the ending was predictable the brothers in the story are not very interesting or believable i am one of four sons and their interaction is unrealistic and not that interesting a big yawn think i will put mr cumming aside for a few years,66,13
855,Books,0007487223,4.0,positive,he just gets better and better at last after early le carre we have a new gold standard for this genre,21,14

860,Books,0007487223,5.0,positive,need to be on the tips of your toes to keep up with the constant switches but worth it one might even develop looking-over-the-shoulder-syndrome,24,19
861,Books,0007487223,2.0,negative,does not stand comparison with lecarre thin plotting poor character development in no way driven by the logic of the story,21,20
1030,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,in the gene re of detective / police novels i think that faye kellerman is the best ms kellerman writes elegantly and she does a thorough resereach of her subject matter in the mercedes coffin you get the feel for the life and language of the hip hop crowd i entertained my teenagers with some of the words that are used in the story my favorite is nomasayin it is sit at theof your chair kind of book the ending is very surprising i will not tell you more buy the book and enjoy,93,0
1031,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,the mercedes coffin by faye kellerman is the seventeenth peter decker and rina lazarus mystery having read most of the preceding mysteries this is like visiting with old friends and very enjoyable peter decker is asked to investigate a fifteen year old murder that is now a cold case that of a very popular guidance counselor from a los angeles school who was found in the trunk of his mercedes shot in the back of the head execution style interest in the case has been raised because someone else has been murdered in the same fashion and found in the trunk of their mercedes faye kellerman always writes a well plotted interesting mystery and the mercedes coffin is no exception i enjoy reading about the decker and lazarus family as much as i enjoy the mystery the only fault i found with this book is that rina lazarus did not play as important a role in this book as she has in others I have read but that said i enjoyed the mercedes coffin very much and it kept me turning pages until the end highly recommended to mystery lovers,189,1
1032,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,money can not buy everything but a billionaire can try when she reads about a murder genoa greeves is reminded about her high school guidance counselor who suffered death by the same mo fifteen years earlier and she is prompted to do something about it so she makes a deal with the lapd offering a million-dollar endowment if the original case is revived and solved who can resist such an offer certainly not the cash-strapped police department so the stage is set for another peter decker-rina lazarus novel and a marvelous tale it is complete with the customary references to the couples orthodox jewish beliefs and culinary tastes lt detective peter decker is assigned to the task and he quickly becomes involved in both cases with a little assistance from his detective daughter cindy the task becomes complicated with additional murders especially those of one of the original detectives as entertaining as the novel is it is intriguing in it is composition keeping the reader perplexed amid the lies deceptions and relationships among the cast of characters it is an exciting read among the series best and the twist at the end is as tasty as a raisin challa highly recommended,199,2
1033,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,love faye kellerman and the peter drecker books very good,10,3
1034,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,i have not read a faye kellerman book in a long time so glad that i rediscovered her this one did not disappoint,22,4

1063,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i was quite disappointed with this book especially the ending there were too many characters to keep track of too many rambling discussions of what might be going on in the case blah blah blah and a final wrap-up that is accomplished via a discussion between characters it was as although time ran out to get this to the publisher,61,33

1066,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,i enjoyed the book as i always do faye kellermans books the story was good but it seemed very repetitive in the dialog between the detectives i love the ongoing playfulness between rina and decker it is a nice family,39,36

1074,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,i enjoy reading mysteries against the other thriller type books wish they were not lumped together on amazon kellerman keeps your interest i am working on reading all her mysteries hope she does not go into thrillers,37,44
1075,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,this was my first faye kellerman book to read it will not be my last the author did an excellent job of writing this police procedural story she took the reader through a cold case with precision i will be reading more o her books in the future,48,45
1076,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,the book was pretty good the dectective work was stellar once again the husband wife team and the daughter was very interesting getting peter to finally go on vacation,29,46
1077,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i found this mystery to be rather predictable i was always aahead of decker and his detectives as for the charming part of the series the relationship between rina and peter and their orthodox lifestyle there was hardly any of it in mercedes coffin as a mystery and as a window into a unique culture the book fails on both counts which does not leave much to enjoy,71,47
1078,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have read all the decker / lazarus books and sorry but this is the one I have enjoyed least lack of action until the last few pages and then a bit implausible give this one a miss,33,48
1079,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have been a fan of faye kellermans in the past but this book was bad the plot was boring very unbelievable overall the book was a big blah wish i would not have spent the money,36,49
1080,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,the book starts off well there has a cold case of a body stuffed into the trunk of a mercedes 15 years later there has another under somewhat similar circumstances ms kellerman needed to stay focused on that premise halfway through the book the author is still introducing more characters you will need a scorecard to keep track she also gets heavily into the members and secondary characters of a punk rock band yep no kidding the dialogue becomes very repetitive and boring there are no twists at the end the ending just shows up it just did not matter by the time ms kellerman decided to end this travesty i just did not care who did it or why ms kellerman would have done well to drastically cut the length and characters to make this into a short story in it is present form it is tedious at best,144,50
1081,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i agree with many of the previous comments i read the first 3 books of the series and remember enjoying them i was pleased to notice this one at the library and was looking forward to a few hours with the appealing decker family i was not bored until the middle of the book but then i kept waiting for something interesting to happen nothing happened i skipped to the end of the book and read the denouement it was anticlimactic and i was glad that i had not bought this book even as a library read i can not recommend it,100,51
1082,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,this is the most boring book I have ever read with the exception of textbooks nothing happens there is no suspense no action and the writing is awful i mean please it was the juiciest turkey sandwich he had ever eaten and the bread was very fresh I shall never read another book by faye kellerman again,57,52
1083,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i enjoy mysteries and cop dramas which this was however the book had typos in it right and left there were numerous scenes that appeared to attempt to flesh out the story line but seemed particularly useless in driving the plot the conclusion was entirely unsatisfying the denouement was boring and lackluster take my 2 cents and spend it wisely,60,53
1084,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,there are few things that disappoint me more than a great story marred by poor writing i thought the premise of the book was great and it had great potential but i just could not suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the story what was up with the endless descriptions of what everyone was wearing every time someone walked in the room we got the dime store paperback pseudo blackwell fashion review he wore a blueshirt and brown slacks his wiry arms still sculpted with defined musculature orthopedic sandals were on his feet she wore a kelly green silk blouse and a pair chino pants her feet were housed in rhinestone sandals yawn so heres the other thing my guy has been a police officer for 32 years the conversations in an investigation just do not go the way they did in this book i read a couple of pages to my guy and he rolled his eyes nuff said i tried i really did i hung in all the way through but the book never redeemed itself I am a little bummed that what could have been a great story was killed by the flat writing,197,54
1085,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i really tried to like this book i did but it became increasingly obvious that without a map i would not be able to find the books direction it had too many details about too many characters it was hard to follow the plot line because of all the boring overwritten unnecessary details having just finished it about the only thing i remember is that peter was married to the always perfect rina the rest of the book was bogged down with such minutia that i was praying for a syllabus or maybe i just prayed for it to end sorry ms kellerman you just lost a reader,107,55
1086,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,peter decker and rina lazarus series as the seventeenth faye kellerman book in the peter decker and rina lazarus series the mercedes coffin was a complex book that addressed the current exercise of solving of cold cases as someone that is very interested in the jewish faith i was a little disappointed that we did not see more of rina in this book the story line has peter investigating a 15 year old file of the murder of dr ben little a school vip his department was asked to look into the case because of a request received from a very wealthy woman who promises great things as a reward when a second victim is also found in the truck of his mercedes there appears to be a tie-in to the previous unsolved murder faye kellermans books always have twists and turns and solving this mystery is very complicated and takes thinking outside the box you must pay attention to what every person says who is questioned the clues are there hidden in their statements as a fan of faye kellermans decker and lazarus series i look forward to her next book,192,56
1087,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,as other reviewers have noted faye kellermans latest should at best be checked out from the library or borrowed from a friend it really is that bad I am glad that I am a fast reader and did not mind wasting a sick-at-home afternoon on a mystery that was not much of a mystery with characters you remember liking but in this outing having difficulty remembering why and a plot that felt like the product of a bad computer program it is understandable that kellerman could be running out of steam on her decker-lazarus series there ve been enough of them still if you were to read the dust jacket blurb a cold case turns red hot threatening to consume everyone it touches including los angelespd detective peter decker and his wife rina lazarus in the spellbinding new thriller you would have to wonder if the blurb writer read the same book you had spellbinding thriller and poor rina is barely peripheral if you have never read one of faye kellermans books check the publication date and opt for one of the early ones at least then you will understand what the acclaim is all about,190,57
1088,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i really do not like reading faye kellerman but will do it if i am hard up for something to read which is what happened this time i think the reason i do not like her books is because reading faye kellerman is kind of like being at jesus camp for judaism by force it is not that i have anything against judaism it is just that i do not like being proselytized to or having religion constantly shoved in my face and that is what kellerman does with her constant references to orthodox judaism the family values the good woman slaving in the kitchen and sacrificing for her children and more it reminds me of accidentally picking up one of those christian fiction books and finding myself in the midst of some characters who talk about nothing except how they are postponing sex until marriage how they can be born again by giving their souls to jesus what they are wearing to the purity ball and more i wish kellerman would just tell her stories and stop trying to be the tim lahaye of judaism,177,58
1089,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,I have read every single book in the peter decker / rina lazarus series as has my mother i love her books but we both gave up on this one boring boring boring i tried to slog through this one but i ended up giving up it just was not worth it if you have not read her before do not start with this one if you have you might want to pass on this one or at least do not buy it check it out of the library dull and tedious,88,59
1090,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,this book was received in a timely manner and in the condition i paid for,16,60
1091,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,I have been a fan of she and her husband for years while hers started out with more characterization they are quickly dwindling to weary plots dragged out dialogue and unsatisfying endings unfortunately this one fits in that category decker just comes across as ready to enter into retirement at any moment ms kellermann please bring back the passion you used to have for these characters or just give us a new character that all of us can enjoy,78,61
1092,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i had not read a faye kellerman book for many years i really enjoyed picking this one up and starting it the beginning was great then it moved so slowly that it was almost painful i had to set aside time to finish it which is unusual in a mystery the plot took a very long time to unwind and i had to admit i was not interested in any of the characters as others said i was glad i borrowed it from the library,85,62
1093,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,this is the first faye kellerman book i simply could not finish after a promising start it became very confusing with all the extra characters that were simply referred to by their first names or last names without the hints that most authors give i only had a little more to read but i lost interest so much i just returned it to the library do not waste your money on this boring book,73,63
1094,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,disappointing the best that can be said is i read a library copy so all i wasted was my time the beginning was great and then the book deteriorated into a complete bomb with discussion after discussion that could not have been more tedious and boring so much so that i really did not care about anything anyone skipping those discussions lost me nothing and the ending was simply too too boring incomplete dull need i go on sorry about this review as i have read the entire decker series very happily over the years will definitely give second thoughts after this one about what I shall do with the next title the supreme irony here for me is that i long ago stopped reading her husbands books for a very similar reason oh well there are enough really good writers out there that we have many other choices,141,64
1095,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,I have read most of faye kellermans novels and have liked many of them especially straight into night but this one is well bad i kept laying it aside and picking up again forcing myself through the tedium when i finally made it to the last page the outcome was disappointing vague see for yourself there could be no murder conviction based on the evidence presented keeping the characters straight was a problem there are all sorts of low lifes without much to distinguish one from another then there is a great deal of extraneous material what characters wore every time they were presented a disciplining editor should have cut a hundred pages or so of fat off this the plot is not all that good either even if this were edited better kellerman tries to write a gritty police procedural but it is not up to the standards of ed mcbain or michael connelly or to kellermans previous work the grit somehow does not feel right i recommend that people skip this one especially faye kellerman fans,170,65
1096,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,as others have said there are too many characters in this book each one is referred to by first name last name and often a nickname sometimes in the same paragraph there has a rudy and a ryan melinda and a marilyn not to mention cal and cal j a red herring that went nowhere and so many times i said to myself who has mudd again i love the series but the last two books have gone downhill,78,66
1097,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,first and foremost i have to say that i am a big fan of the authors i have followed this series forever i was so excited to see a new novel with this cast the reality of it is that the only enjoyable part of this book was kind of catching up with the cast the whole story dragged and was so confusing with the million and one characters i found that the story was slow to develop and many times i had to re-read a section just to wrap my mind around the cast of characters there were just too many names being thrown around essentially i would say there were too many threads being pulled on at once i did not enjoy the book at all and although i am an avid reader it was like pulling teeth to get myself to finish reading it hopefully she can do better in the next installment,155,67
1098,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,i especially enjoy reading books when the author has the main characters the same people in their books,18,68
1099,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i generally love these novels this one just did not hit the mark for me overly long and way too much time between beginning middle and end and the ending was not satisfactory after suffering through the book to get there,38,69
1100,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,a smart mystery kellerman develops her ongoing characters with every outing in this series,14,70
1101,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i have enjoyed the decker series since the beginning what happened it is as if faye kellerman was not writing the book i have enjoyed the characters and learning about the jewish faith but something is very wrong i could not keep track of the characters i thought it was me until i read another review that said the same thing i have not even been able to finish the book although i am trying faye we love you please take note of this and bring back the old format in the next book your fans will be back i hope you are to,100,71
1102,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,i am a big fan of faye kellermans books with the peter decker / rina lazuras continuing characters being my favorite while this is a fast paced intriguing who done it i was fascinated with the current day exploration of a case tied to the past ms kellermans plots and characters are always fresh with current events tied in appropriately her research and authenticity ring true for me i also find it a real treat to try to get a small glimpse into the beliefs and observances of an orthodox jewish family and i enjoy the real family values that these characters portray especially in this day and age i would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a story that is exciting a bit philosophical and has a great underlying message about the importance of family i applaud this effort and greatly appreciated this book,145,72
1103,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,I am a fan of fay kellerman I have totally enjoyed her decker lazarus books in the past this one should have come with a map a real big map this story grabs you from the beginning the first third meets and greats the characters but there are too many characters sometimes referred to by their first names and sometimes their last that i had trouble keeping them straight so many plots discussed over and over that i really can not even begin to explain the plot i wanted to like this book however i just wanted it to end tear out the middle third and you might enjoy it,107,73
1104,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i am a huge faye kellerman fan and have read every book in the peter decker rina lazarus series but i have to say that this is probably the last walk I shall take with these characters after reading the last book the burnt house i held out hope that this next book would be better but it was not i m glad i checked it out from the library instead of paying for it i was so incredibly disappointed definitely not recommended,81,74
1105,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,sorry to have to be negative but i have read everything that faye kellerman has ever written and she is allowed to have her off days this book finishes it for me i could not keep track of all the characters the family life of rina and decker was not flushed out as i used to enjoy forget the picnic basket contents it was not worth the effort this time and i am beyond disappointed seems she is writing to the new generation and i am certainly and happily not one of them could not recommend this book i wonder did she really write it or was it a surrogate,108,75
1106,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,for those of you that gave a few thumbs down to the past 2 or 3 books by this author do not give up this is the old faye kellerman with lots of action and what ifs in it this was a very good read and i recommend it the storyline was quite realistic in this day and time hannah is a teenager with all the angst that goes with it cindy is a detective and helps peter with a cold case that he was assigned,85,76
1107,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have loved all of the faye kellerman books except this one the characters were flat and the plot even flatter it is as if she had to put this one out in a hurry it took me 8 days to read it i kept waiting for the plot to get interesting it never did,51,77
1108,Books,0061227374,5.0,positive,great story this is the first faye kellerman I have read but i will definitely read more of her work,19,78
1109,Books,0061227374,4.0,positive,fifteen years ago dr ben little a very popular school vice president was murdered execution style and found in the trunk of his mercedes the crime was never solved one of the students whose life he touched is now a very wealthy woman when she reads a current article in the newspaper about another man found dead in the trunk of his mercedes she believes the two crimes are somehow related she offers a million dollars to the lapd to take another look at the cold case the story follows lt peter decker who is assigned the task of finding dr bens killer through a maze of relationships that tie known associates to both of the murdered men the story contains a lot of layers as the puzzle pieces come together this is the first book I have read by the author i very much appreciated the mystery aspect of the story which was well thought out and was surprised at the outcome i also appreciated that triggers were pointed out to us during questioning of various people giving us a betterof what the detective got out of it instead of having it explained to us afterwards,197,79
1110,Books,0061227374,1.0,negative,i have read all of faye kellermans books this is the first one that i found boring i thought that it was way too complicated and could not follow the characters and plot i missed the family connections and traditions that were in her other books i thought the novel was too drawn out and had to push myself to finish it i was very disappointed,65,80
1111,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,faye kellermans detective peter decker seems more like a woman with every new book a likable and competent woman the male / female contrast that we saw in the earlier novels is lacking rinas presence in this book is slight and it is okay because we do not have any need to balance peter he has gone over to our side,57,81
1112,Books,0061227374,2.0,negative,i have been a long-time fan of faye kellerman peter and rina and their family have been familiar characters for many years through many books this one started out with a compelling mystery two men were killed 15 years apart in a very similar manner both of them were found dead in the trunks of their mercedes automobiles peter decker tries to solve the two murders about half-way through the book the endless talking of the characters starts the detectives were working very hard trying to come up with viable suspects who had a motive to kill both men there were so many names to discuss where they went to school how they knew the murdered men where they were when the crimes were comitted what they were doing now and more for the last half of the book that is all they did discuss i was so glad to see the end of the book that I am not sure i could even tell you how these different characters were involved to quote the book the author said on page 331 that was detective work hours of mind-numbing tedium followed by that compensatory glory-hallelujah once-in-a-blue-moon shot-in-the-veins adrenaline rush i never got beyond the mind-numbing tedium,200,82
1230,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,you can get the import of tpd which is only a few bucks more and includes the original as the sixth track after watching lost highway there has no way in he shall identification want the soundtrack,35,0
1231,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,if tpd is a sign of things to come for trent reznor then I am just blown away and anxiously await his new album this fall the perfect drug is a tour-de-force of drum n bass electronica and reznors traditional harsh metal / industrial inspired angst i think he has lightened up a bit too which is also a fresh change,57,1
1232,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,the perfect drug has overdosed how they absolutely managed too slaughter an otherwise good song with these less than stellar versions well trent knew how too create it so it is obvious he knew how too destroy it too he still laughs all the way to the bank avoid unless a collector 25 for a rating i was forced too give it a full star,65,2
1233,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,when i first heard the perfect drug i was blown away it is an amazing song so i of course snapped up the lost highway soundtrack and then this cd when it was released to my complete surprise the perfect drug was not on the disc in it is place were 5 unrecognizable remixes sub-par at best this release was a great disappointment and while the remixes were not all bad they did completely wreck an otherwise beautiful song and that is unforgiveable so needless to say this cd single is best avoided unless you a fan of the remixers or a nin completist,102,3
1234,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,i loved the original version from the lost highway i only found out that i had to buy that soundtrack to find the original version not featured on this overwritten piece to make a long story short buy the lost highway soundtrack,42,4
1235,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,i am going to get straight to the point if you are not a huge nin fan nor are you collecting all the singles and albums i would not recomend you purchase this cd it does not include the original version of the song which is the only good version i have heard only the japanese import includes it as a 6th track i purchased this cd when it came out 10 years ago and i was disapointed the mixes are long drawn out and just do not catch your ear but like i said if you are a collector of nin cds it is essential just like everything else so for that matter it is worth the 6 bucks but if your not a huge fan i would not buy it,132,5
1236,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,just buy the perfect drug versions and the original version is on itunes lost highway soundtrack or one of the we are in this together singles these all all great songs would be nice to have them all in once package,40,6
1237,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,absolute rubbish not even close to the brilliance of the original recording if you loved the original like i did you will hate this,23,7
1238,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,one of my personal favorite halos i think some of the haters have their collective heads up their butts when they say this and fixed are too weird come on get out of your parents dank and dingy basements and live imitation is the greatest form of flattery,48,8
1239,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,i was dissapointed when i listened to this cd all i wanted was the original version of the perfect drug this cd only has the remixes so if you are buying this cd for the original version you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the lost highway instead,49,9
1240,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,not what i thort it was gunna be not that good,11,10
1241,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,this remix album is very interesting featuring 6 remixes the first 2 are amazing and the nin mix is great also,21,11
1242,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,ok people stop bitching about there not being the original version of tpd you all know you already have the lost highway soundtrack anyway so what has your beef and if you do not go get it it is fantastic with or without trents contributions ok I shall get straight to it this was the first nin cd i bought i happened to decide to go to the record shop the very day this puppy was released and picked it up for a song loved it from the get go this was the cd that made me fall in love with nin if nothing else it introduced me to four other amazing artists-luke vibert jack dangers spacetime continuum and orb the only mix that is less than superb is the orb 5 tracks 4 great songs pretty easy to score do not you think,139,12
1243,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,this is one of the first cds that introduced me to remixing and is still one of my favorites this is remixing how it should be it bends the limits of the original work and creates something utterly different and brilliant i personally prefer these versions vastly to the original which is in my opinion not one of trents better songs i was very excited to see the orb and meat beat manifesto in the mix they really brought out the finer and more subtle elements of the song and really made it their own the only nin remixs that i would reccomend more than this would be the telefon tel aviv remix of where is everybody which is absolutely incredible i reccomend it to any nin fan or ttv fan who is open minded and willing to hear what sounds more like a collaboration than a remix a final note to all you so-called nin purists out there who did not like this project because it did not sound enough like the original try making your own remix and see if it comes out even close to any of these maybe then you will change your mind,194,13
1244,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,i do not know why this ep has gotten bad reviews no the original version is not on here whatever if you are a hardcore nails fan you have already got it on the lost highway soundtrack this is definitely one of if not his absolute best remix album every track is absolutely bitchin good for driving and those late nights and wee early morning hours of twilight unless you absolutely hate drum n bass / jungle / techno stuff it is a remix folks you will love this album dammit,83,14
1245,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,do not get me wrong i think perfect drug is one of the best songs to ever come from trent reznors nine inch nails outfit but this cd single is for die hard nin fans only who do not already own the original song featured on the lost highway soundtrack there are five tracks of remixes one of which done by reznor which is the only track that comes close to resembling the original song the other four tracks are loaded with remixed industrial loops and blips that borderline on annoying and is kind of boring these remixes really do not hold a candle to the original and your better off getting the lost highway soundtrack considering this single does not even include the original song all in all this halo is for die hard nin fans only,134,15
1246,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,okay so usually i can be open minded about too many singles filled with too many remixes and not enough original material but I am throwing objectivity out the window and letting fly on this piece of sh te 5 boring and repetitive remixes of the perfect drug and the original version is not even on here get the day the world went away pt 3 and consider yourself saved f ck you reznor,70,16
1247,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,so many of y all might love the original to death to me it is aight it is good but these remixes are even better my favorite tracks off this is spacetime continuums phenominal remix luke viberts smash and trent keiths remix i got to also mention meat beats remix thumbs up the orbs was so-so and was more annoying than amuzing but i give it a play every now and then,69,17
1248,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,i guess i must have been lucky or something because when i bought this ep it had a made in australia sticker on the back and it actually had the original perfect drug on it the remixes are pretty good but none live up to the original,47,18
1249,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,a lot of people probably would be dissapionted with this cd when they hear it because the original is not on here if you want the original buy lost highway soundtrackwere in this together 3or the import of this people that buy this for the original must be kinda blind or something but oh well that is your problem the original song is perfect in every way and to have a whole remix cd deticated to it is great considering all of these remixes are really good too although to have most 4/5 of the remixes buy other people is not really like nin cds it is still really good i just wish more remixes were by nin themself,113,19
1250,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,i remember i bought this cd hoping for the original version of perfect drug and i got 5 remixes that were odd and interesting but not the actual song i had to buy an import release that had a 6th track that included original version,45,20
1251,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,wow this album really and I am highly sure trent would agree with me if you really want to hear the perfect drug buy the lost highway soundtrack because that is the only place you will find the not remixed song along with buying lost highway you will find music that will agree with you such as manson bowie lou reed and ramstein and someone who said this album is closely rivaled with closer,76,21
1252,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,i love the song perfect drug so naturally i bought it is ep that is where i ran into problem 1 the original perfect drug is not on the album sure the remixes are intresting to say the least but each one sans trents version get boring really quickly as they just seem to float in limbo for 7 minutes casual nin fans need not apply but for a halo collector like me well it does not really matter what has on the actuall disc,80,22
1253,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,I am a huge fan of the original version of the perfect drug i love every element aspect and second of the song this ep takes each ascpect of that song and makes new completely different versions of it the meat beat manifesto version is a great way to start out the cd with it is layeryed drumming and symbols this track goes for over 7 mins long this one very song made me go out and buy some mbm albums the plug version is good as well but my favorite from the cd is without a doubt the nin version which is nearly 9 minutes long this track builds and builds and has without a doubt one of the greatest endings in a nin song closely rivaled by closer the orb version well that is the only one i can not listen to over and over it is just far too spacy overall this is a awesome cd which i listen to over and over and even got me into these other bands the only gripe is that the original version is not on the cd but with all these other excellent versions there is no need to complain at all,195,23
1254,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,this is a tragic mistake most of the time trent reznor relies upon himself and a few close collaborators to work on remixing nins music the results are always fascinating and often become equally valid versions of the song in their own right that is why trent reznor always refers to them as versions not remixes here although reznor has got a variety of people together to work on the perfect drug and the results are not worthy of a nin release trent reznors own remix track 3 is excellent and the only redeeming feature of the disc it is very exciting and powerful exploring the driving rhythms of the original now infected with drums and bass but the other remixes do not compare they are interesting enough but for most of the time they have almost no connection to the original song which defeats the point of the exercise buy it for reznors version but do not expect the same excellence from the other tracks,165,24
1255,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,sorry but it is on so many other things that you can still love it there is a remix by nin and one by the orb who seem to have the best remix on here besides nin because this is more of remixes on a maxi-single then just a normal single 4 makes you wonder if you are listening to the perfect drug there is not even words get the original on the lost highway soundtrack closure and we are in this together pt 2 or you may even be insisting on finding it on the damaged box set since it is the witt singles plus things you would not regularly get but still get this,110,25
1256,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,i love nin i could not bring myself to give this disc less than five stars but the only reason i bought this was to complete my collection only the german and australian imports have the original song on the single which mystifies me so do not buy this expecting it to be on there like i said if you are a diehard nin fan and want to complete your collection or if you want to hear the remixes by all means go for it if not buy the lost highway soundtrack or the we are in this together single i do not remember which one it is on there are three we are in this together singles yellow green and orange infrom different countries with different track listings or buy the single for into the void,133,26
1257,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,2.0,negative,okay so I have read that this would be a great cd for serious nin collectors of course if you already are are a serious nin collector then you would have all these tracks already would not you even if you did not own lost highway the original version of perfect drug is on one of the wittn discs 3rd one i think anyway this release has irritated me as much as the last one into the void as it only has pre-released material and before that i had to buy 3 discs for a couple weak remixes trent i love ya man but come on here we waited five years for this regurgitated material is seriously disappointing give us something more,118,27
1258,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,dose this have a halo and if so what is it,12,28
1259,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,this is a fairly good cd but i would not recomened it to a new nin fan as some of the remixes do not sound like nin to much the first mix is the best i only give the united states version two stars but this england / japan import has the origional version of perfect drug on it is as the bonus track i recomended spending the extra money for this version rather than the american version,72,29
1260,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,i loved the original of this song and i love this single these remixes are all interesting because they take certain elements from the song and then mix them up with cuts from the vocals and their own ideas my favorite songs are the ones remixed by spacetime continuum jonah sharp this song made me buy a spacetime continuum cd and the one remixed by the orb i like the piano they included in the middle of this remix the two parts i like best in the perfect drug are the piano and the drums this single is good but i recommend the lost highway sdtk especially if you like nine inch nails because it has 2 other songs trent did,121,30
1261,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,first off if you liked the original song the perfect drug from lost highway then do not but this it consists of trent and 4 bands making strange otherworldly mixes that are almost but not entirely completely unlike the perfect drug if you like interminable incoherent mixes la meat beat manifesto you might enjoy this cd but do not expect it to sound like nin even the reznor / hillebrant mix sounds very little like nine inch nails if this cd included the original unadulterated version of the song it would be worht buying but as it is it offers very little to the nin fan unless you are one of those nuts who absolutely must own every halo it also loses a star for having an ugly purplish cd,129,31
1262,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,when i finally noticed that on the front cover camouflaged with the colors there was the list of the bands that performed each mix when i saw the name meat beat manifesto it made me wonder then when i heard their version of perfect drug i had different feelings for them i love the deep bass in the first track 720 min version by meat beat manifesto listening to that track alone is well worth the price and the reason to buy this certain disc,80,32
1263,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,do not expect to get the original song here you will get cool re-mixes that is it if you want the original song buy the lost highway soundtrack the first re-mix on this single is by meat beat manifesto it is the best one well done the rest are good too but buy it only if you like re-mixes or if you want to add it to your halos,65,33
1264,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,the reason that many are disapointed with nins cds is because they buy it expecting what they get other places music written for radio and to sell cds sure trents music is written in the hope that people can appriciate it but it is not meant for it the singles and remixes are no exception and in fact they are even more geared towards hardcore fans but i will add if you really want the single for this that you heard on the radio get the import version of this cd it is the version that contains the singles that make everyone love a band till the radio likes something else,111,34
1265,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5.0,positive,if anyone is a true nin fan they will greatly appreciate this album it is not supposed to be a pop cd or geared towards comercialism as many people expected rather it is an experimental work as are all nin remix albums an expression as art if you appreciate music that the rest of the world will never hear that has some artistic integrity some creativity and ingenuity get this album do not expect however the original or songs oriented towards a pop culture,82,35
1266,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,there are more then a few nin fans i know who do not like this cd but i guess that could be expected this is definitly off track from most of trent reznors other work none of these mixes are really very close to the original either i would recomend this cd either for people who are interested in electronic music drum n bass especially or who do not mind hearing trent doing something different i agree with the other reviews although you should not own this cd without also having the original version,92,36
1267,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,this is not the song from the soundtrack and i do not care who remixed it the whole cd sounds like you are playing the soundtrack version while flushing your toilet continuously sorry i usually love anything trent does come back to us trent ps splurge on the lost highway soundtrack instead you get the original kick-azz version of the song plus a complete selection of music guaranteed to creep you out but in a good way,72,37
1268,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,if I am ever tired and i want to go to sleep i just pop that cd in and i crash instantly if i ever want to get pumped up to go somewhere i just pop that cd in and I am ready to go,43,38
1269,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,1.0,negative,i enjoyed the original version better you can find it on the lost highways soundtrack plus you get songs by marilyn manson trent reznor david bowie smashing pumpkins and rammstien much better take my advise and buy that instead,39,39
1270,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,4.0,positive,blah blah blah cue whiny voice the domestic does not come with the original buy the import it is only twice the price blah blah blah reality check people the original version is on the lost highway soundtrack an album worth buying in it is own right the 6 more you spend on the import could be put to that and you are getting more than just one song lost highway has numerous quality tracks smashing pumpkins eye david bowies I am deranged a couple from marilyn manson and more what ever happened to practicality,90,40
1271,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4.0,positive,well I am saddened to see some of the negative reviews because this is a brillant cd which i have had in my collection for a decade now and every now and then i play it just because i love it so much yes there are a couple of questionable tracks but the rest more than make up for it it is about time was practically my anthem for many years during uni and tracks like great big no into my arms you can take it with you favorite t and bigheart are just about some of the best folk pop / rock gems I have ever heard in short I am astounded when people call this a flop because in oz it was huge at least in my circle of friends it is even outlasted most of them in fact great stuff evan i really enjoy and respect your work,146,0
1272,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4.0,positive,some brilliant three chord magic here the first six songs are some of the most cleverly-arranged pop songs you may ever hear after that it is still three chords but not nearly as inspired if you view this record like a plane crash the first six songs are a pristine take off and ascent it is about time down about it the next three or four are the plane plateauing dawn can not decide I shall do it anyway after that it is a very gradual loss of elevation and the plane begins descending finally the whole thing explodes in the end with the jello fund quite possibly the worst song of any genre ever to be recorded,113,1
1273,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5.0,positive,with the exception of the jello fund an obvious joke come on feel the lemonheads is packed with well-crafted pop from start to finish into your arms has all the ingredients of the perfect pop single other tracks like it is about time down about it paid to smile and bigheart are as catchy as they come by this time the lemonheads were a well-polished pop unit leaving behind much of the hardcore punk sound they had started with fans of earlier lps such as hate your friends or creator may not take to their later sound but anyone with an ear for melody will find this disc irresistible,110,2
1274,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5.0,positive,evan and his gang reached their zenith with this one it combines perfect pop power singles with quirky cool lyrics that are impossible to resist listening to I shall do it anyway catapults back me to florida turnpikes and contains the best thing belinda carlisle ever went near one of evans strengths is the quality of his song writing collaborators so it is unfair to see him as solely a one man band perfectly quotables here include being around a heartbreakingly cool rhyme of wonderous simplicity copyright restrictions prevent me or else I had reproduce it all here but the closing line I am a little grubby from just being around is so cool favorite t is nearly as good and again proves the quality of this record with these songs combined with the singles released this one has to win a place in anyones collection only the worst bigot could fail to be charmed by evans campfire song bigheart this from one of rocks greatest pinfor indie chicks of a certain age his ballad of love to julianna it is about time should be standard issue for balcony singers everywhere only downside is the drug references that signal dandos eventual decline,203,3
1275,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4.0,positive,i am astounded at how poorly this album was received by the record-buying public in general and by so-called lemonhead / dando fans in particular after the critical and commercial success enjoyed with the shame about ray album dando again delivers a beautifully crafted mixture of tunes which range from the up-beat into your arms penned by robyn st clare bassist with defunct australian guitar / pop outfit the hummingbirds to the soulful / melancholy of bigheart and being around dando is one of the least appreciated musican / songwriters of his generations which i suspect is a result of his reluctance to sick with a particular sound or music genre personally i enjoy and appreciate dandos ability to craft and cover great tunes that range from clever pop guitar I shall do it anyway to country / parody bigheart to rock down about it and the whimsical folky sound of being around genuine fans of real music rather than the mass-manufactured fm-friendly crap than dominates westerm music charts could do a lot worse than acquiring the lemonheads final trilogy of shame about ray come on feel the lemonheads and car button cloth,186,4
1276,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,1.0,negative,hate your friends lick and creator are good cds but unfortunately it is a steep downhill fall for americas own billy idol of punk rock if ever a punk bandssinger has been marketed as a cute boy band type then surely it is evan dando as the cds come feel the lemonheads get more mellow the image makeover gos into overdrive until every am radio station or tampon company comes calling to use his sensitive adult rock for marketing purposes but let me put down my crystal ball for a moment the problem with the pretty boy stuff is sooner than later it becomes like yesterdays newspaper to be put at the bottom of bird cages or thrown out my only first hand experience with evan dando was struggling to get a coke out of a coke machine before a gig we failed evan probably has better luck with the ladies than i but i sleep soundly knowing my art work is not overtaking used cd shops at give away prices remember you can discount a crap cd but it is still a crap cd,183,5
1277,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,1.0,negative,it is a shame about ray showed the lemonheads potential potential that is saidly squandered with this most likely hurried follow-up although into your arms is pleasent it is not worth buying the whole album for save your money if you want to try the lemonheads i suggest their earlier material,49,6
1278,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,4.0,positive,this the second album from dando that i own the other being it is a shame about ray is a good pop rock albumi usually despise pop but dando gets away with it for me for some reasonmaybe why i like it so much is because of the addition of one of my faves julianna hatfield singing back-up on most of the albummy only problem with the album really is the jello fund can somebody explain why it is even on the album otherwise the album is very goodthe lyrics sometimes are a little less to be desired but than dando redeems himself with songs like bigheart so if you are a fan of it is a shame about ray this album should not come as a big disappointment as it is not as great as that one is but is still a good album nevertheless,135,7
1279,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5.0,positive,come on feel the lemonheads everyone has their heroes and evan dando has got to be one of mine this is still my favorite lemonheads records maybe a little sweet and poppy but the quality of the songs of awesome and very easy from great big no to into your arms and the awesome bigheart it is about time and down about it it is all so much fun to listen to a really funny song is being around great even after 12 years,84,8
1280,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,5.0,positive,this album totall rocks my socks this is bright n light 90s bubblegum pop at it is best if you are looking to be depressed go buy some nine inch nails this is not what this album is about if you are feeling nostalgic and want to take a trip back down memory lane get this album,53,9
1281,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002IWY,1.0,negative,this is not very good the lemonheads was turned from a gritty but funny / slapstick punk band to an awfully happy pop band i am surprised that the new kids on the block are not singing in the back in some of the songs this album is filled with way too happy songs-it just does not fit the lemonheads image into your arms is probally the best song on the album but still it is way too cheerful people often say that you can not change a person at all i do not agree with them it has happened to group of people and it was the lemonheads major record label success changed the lemonheads how sad,110,10
1282,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,5.0,positive,great album lots here for fans of both rap and hard rock i could see listening to this before a football game the only complaint is the lack of dialogue from the movie and where has steamin willie beaman,38,0
1283,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,5.0,positive,this album is a great album even although the songs are not on the movie anyone can tell by reading the tracklist but anyhow the cd is good ll cool js song is a classic and all the songs are very listenable if you like rap and rock this is a great mix of both,54,1
1284,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1.0,negative,the artists featured in the movie need to be represented on the soundtrack perhaps this was not done because some of the best songs are already on soundtracks for other movies and this cd was meant represent a more diverse group of artists who knows fyi the touch-football beach scene with the girls in bikinis features comoby one of los angeless best bands ozomatli look for their new album later this summer and you can find them on the ed tv never been kissed and very bad things soundtracks and of course on their own album,97,2
1285,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1.0,negative,after seeing the movie i was eager to get ahold of the soundtrack boy was i wrong this soundtrack captures only a few of the songs that were actually used in the movie i was extremely upset at what was a clear attempt to market this soundtrack as a rap / hard rock album than what it should have been a soundtrack that stays true to the movie what a commercial sellout by whoever put the soundtrack album together i heard several songs by moby and other dance / techno artists throughout the film but none of their songs were included on the cd if you are a fan of rap which I am not then I had recommend the album if you saw the movie and liked the music from the movie do not buy the soundtrack,131,3
1286,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,2.0,negative,where is all the techno / electronic music they played throughout the whole movie like fatboy slims right here right now from the opening football scene this cd has way too much rap and not the techno that was played throughout the movie,41,4
1287,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4.0,positive,i was pretty darn impressed with this cd usually i listen to plain old rock and roll but i was persuaded to purchase this cuz of good old pod their song along with the godsmack and ll cool j tracks are what make this an excellent buy for almost any fan of music,53,5
1288,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4.0,positive,i was wondering what that track was also mark did u ever manage to find out what it was the one after the priests speech that goes bless me father for i have sinned,34,6
1289,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1.0,negative,this movie was full of good clips but the songs on the soundtrack are not what i was looking for it is loaded with gansta rap if that is your style then this album is for you can anyone tell me what song is playing after the priests speech the lyrics go bless me father for i have sinned i can not find anything on this one at all,68,7
1290,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4.0,positive,dmx and ll coolj really made this soundtrack a 4star-album but still there has a missing one not on th soundtrack does anyone remember the song when they are playin the crusaders when willy throws the last touchdown pass on the game there comes out a song going do you want to revolution whooah whooah do you want to revolution whooah whooah that songs also cool but no way to find out the musician nor the title can anybody tell me what it is,80,8
1291,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,2.0,negative,after the quick moving blood pounding way in which the music is presented in the movie i was looking forward to having this cd in my car to roll and bounce down the highway alas that was not to be with the exception of the throbbingly insistent rhythm of jamie foxx any given sunday the disc has no continuity apparently the best cuts from all these tunes appeared in the film on the cd it just sounds like a mish-mash with no purpose other than to sell these not-even-the-best-of tunes from otherwise dynamic artists,94,9
1292,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,1.0,negative,fer cryin out loud the big songs in the film are not on this cd or on volume 2 maybe there will be a volume 3 the songs you expected and paid for edition,33,10
1293,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,5.0,positive,this is the ultimate trading soundtrack the first cd is worth the price admission for missy elliots who you going to call alone a rap song sampling mozarts requiem which lent gravitas to the opening sequences of the movie actually it seems that ollie stone is discovering his true talent as a music video montage editor much of the power of the film which is fun but not nearly so fun as his first venture into jump cut-mtv era film-making chaos natural born killers came from the steroid-pumped soundtrack without a doubt one of the best movie soundtracks ever put together almost as good as raw adrenaline,105,11
1294,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003TKHA,4.0,positive,i am a dj from chicago and i love the song shutem down it is a song that will get you pumped up anyone who likes rap will love that song the rest of the cd is excptional,38,12
1308,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5.0,positive,i first heard hawthorne heights ohio is for lovers on the radio and i decided that i would take a chance and buy the cd which is something i usually do not do it was the most worthwhile music purchase of my life from the first chords of life on standby to the haunting chords at the end of speeding up the octaves the whole album was unlike anything else i had ever seen the vocals of jt woodruff are unique and enthralling the guitars are amazing especially in the transition and silver bullet by far the best album of the year,101,0
1309,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5.0,positive,read my reveiw for the original and you will see how much i loved it this is even better because hawthorne heights is one of the few bands that perform live very well the interveiws make it better but the songs are the reason i bought the first one and is the reason you should buy this however the specials are extremely awesome,62,1
1310,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4.0,positive,i loved the song ohio is for lovers and bought the cd for that track but the rest of the songs are really good cynical yes but then again most emo music is the cd / dvd booklet has info on what they were thinking when they wrote the song a long with the lyrics which are wonderful over all great album i look forward to seeing what their next cd is like,71,2
1311,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4.0,positive,great album got it for a friend as a gift but we listen to it together and i love it great album and wonderful song,25,3
1312,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4.0,positive,niki fm rules many other songs here are good as well hh provides lots of slow n fast hi n lo light n heavy if you are wanting deep vocals and interesting lyrics mixed with riffs and rhythmn that run the spectrum this album is for you they remind me of silverstein quite a bit I am prolly a little old to be listening to this kind of music but I am young at heart and strong of soul i say 4,80,4
1313,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1.0,negative,first of all I had like to say that i like taking back sunday brand new from autumn to ashes early dashboard confessional and other things of that nature and still can not stomach this at all it is complete disposable trash that seems to even be soon forgotten by fans ohio is for lovers was a catchy enough tune but this music is just wayyy too suburban privalaged white kid cuts themsleve feels alienated wears black crys no one understands woe is me I had rather write 10 pages in my live journal about suicide then actually killing myself self indulgent black eyliner hot topic trl neo-goth garbage if you are offended by any of this you should check out my chemical romances album i brought you my bullets you brought me your love which i actually like because it actually more effectivly and artisiclly captures this mood all lyrical criticisms aside the music is not good either,154,5
1314,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5.0,positive,i was sold this cd / dvd off of amazon and some loser gave me the two discs in other blank paper cases like there was no case at all it was listed as a used very goodand i really can not find anywhere to beat the crap out of this guy for cheating me i do not usually buy albums but i was compelled to buy this one just because hawthorne heights is amazing and i wanted to support them,79,6
1315,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5.0,positive,not only the cd but also the dvd are amazing the cd includes demo versions acoustic versions and a song as a day in the life,26,7
1316,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,4.0,positive,stop the hate everybody this is an emo / screamo band I have heard this album many times before god bless mp3s and i am actually about to buy it to pass my time in afghanistan granted my favorite songs are the singles it is still a good album and just my two cents from a black kid who listens to anything from ti and jurassic 5 to avenged sevenfold escape the fate chiodos rise against 3 of 4 albums thursday tbs to the forecast and billy talent check these two out i definitely would say if you want to rock out give this album a shot everybody loves a lil bit screaming mixed with depression,110,8
1317,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,5.0,positive,i love these guys ever since i saw them at house of blues here in myrtle in 05 my favorite i am also a huge senses failed and sum 41 and unwritten law fan i saw them all together 2 years ago since then i have bought all 2 cds yes there is 3 they had a band before with a difference name before they signed with new label i have seen them in concert 2 times i also play guitar and am in a band and i love the hard hitting riffs and picks scrapes and mutes they really give the songs meaning i love thesingers voice to it is great for this type of music i would reccomend to anyone who is into any kind of rock to pick this one up,135,9
1318,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1.0,negative,my girlfriend bought this when it came out and unwillingly i have listened to it nonstop since my opinion is that this is nothing but a bunch of depressed emo whining about ex-girlfriends if a girl gets you that depressed you are a dam fool who should just off yourself the whole emo scene just pisses me off all they do is whine and complain i like my music with a positive message or a socially aware or a pissed off message like madball vision of disorder hatebreed biohazard stuff like that albums that people should check out instead of this would be biohazard urban discipline madball set it off madball demonstrate my style vision of disorder self titled,119,10
1319,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,2.0,negative,very very very cliched emo / screamo the guy that tries too hard to scream is ugly which kills a percentage of hh every song sounds the same very slow with crappy lyrics transition blue burns orange and niki fm are the only decent songs ohio is good but very played out and hh playing on trl killed their trying to be hardcore image sorry hh but now i know why ohio has hardly any rock bands,73,11
1320,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1.0,negative,ok first of all i hate emo music i hate punk rock and now i get the opportunity to hate this band too a buddy of mine recommended this cd to me he said it is awesome they really are good i promise you will like them they are soo hardcore being the idiot i was i actually believed him and bought it i listened to about 10 seconds of every song speaks for itself all i have to say is that this is the most expensive frisbee i have ever bought but on the upside since my friend lied to me i get to kick him right square in his gooch if you like this then try slitting your wrist with a rusty soda can you would probly like that too that is if you have not already from exposing yourself to this joke of a rock band,146,12
1321,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,2.0,negative,the stand alone album gets 3-stars in my book but the live material which you are paying extra for here features some rather badly done vocal work by the band i even felt emberassed for them the first time i watched it the acoustic versions of the songs are nice but nothing to write home about also the albums jacket has a new feature which has the band systematically explaining the meaning behind each of the songs and even addresses ohio is for lovers infamous so slit my wrists and black my eyes line which is more of a figurative comment than a literal one in either case the album is medicore at best there are a handful of catchy songs like ohio is for lovers the transition silver bullet and orange burns blue but there is not anything terribly engaging here the entire time i felt myself longing to switch my mp3 players album selection to thursday time and time again I am not sure why although i think thursday has a more refined sound or something i can not quite put my finger on it,184,13
1322,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1.0,negative,no I am not kidding somebody actually had the nerve to call hawthorne heights a modern hardcore classic yeah you just keep thinking that okay meanwhile the rest of us will stick to the real modern classics like thursdays war all the time underoaths they are only chasing saftey or emerys the weaks end modern hxc classic ha that is funny,58,14
1323,CDs_and_Vinyl,B00073K8CU,1.0,negative,i have to admit this band is a good introduction if your not used to screaming however after you have heard one song from a good band like silverstein from first to last alexisonfire ect ect you should never ever listen to this cd again the songs are all very basic and the lyrics are all very repetitive when your trying to act like your a decent screamo band and the majority of your fans are 13 year old girls who are all like oh my god i 3 hawthorne heights ohio is for lovers roxors then you have got a problem anyway if your a 12 - 14 year old girl this is the album for you if your a guy and you like this album give it time you will realize just how absolutly piss poor it is,133,15
1324,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this is the best piece of work you have ever put out and i have been listening to your music good and bad since 1969 tasty guitar chops and music with a groove,32,0
1325,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,do not expect ercic clapton guitar god on this one pick up from the cradle journeyman and more if you are looking for that eric the eric on back home returns to the classic laid back feel displayed on 461 ocean boulevard slowhand and more this is a catharthic experience for clapton and his soul cleansing comes through in an honest and soulful way listen to say what you will and run home to me and you will hear it first hand there are also some excellent covers of love comes to everyone g harrison and love do not love nobody spinners pick this one up and sit back and enjoy your visit to ecs home you might not want to leave,114,1
1326,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,although i may not have been born when during claptons heyday i am definatley a huge fan this album being his first album of new material in 4 years is definatley worth picking up clapton covers everything from r b tunes to reggae to classic clapton blues definatley one for fans of the 90s clapton although the rest of us can still appreciate it it is clapton after all I shall see you all on his 2006 world tour,77,2
1327,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,eric clapton is a great guitar player but he has been making the same album over over over againvocally i are not never really felt him too muchthe songwriting is alrightthe arrangements overall musicianship here is real polished but is lacking any feeling on a whole eric clapton found a niche a while back stayed with it has worked for himbut it just makes for another run of the mill album,64,3
1328,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,as a fan of he shall bent ear splitting raging guitar i can certainly see why some people would think this is not a fine production from guitar god eric clapton but those people are 14 years old and wrong this is a fine cd with a range of music on it including gospel reggae ballad good old rock n roll and more it is quite clear from reading ecs book and listening to this cd that clapton has indeed found himself a home he is comfortable with as a man and that has led to his mellowing as a musician do not get me wrong i love claptons strung-out-I am-a-junkie stuff the same as the next guy there is not a piece on this cd with a guitar solo that holds a candle to the solo in badge for instance or crossroads there are however some soaring moments where he rips it up pretty good and i think every song on it is good some even great do not let the fact that you will not instantaneously love every note on this cd prevent you from buying it it is definitely his best effort in years,188,4
1329,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,this is the musical equivalent of having to look at photos of someone elses kids it is nice that life has improved for eric he has had very rough times in the past so he deserves it and he obviously loves his children but great music usually comes from hungry tormented artists the giveaways string arrangements the kiss of death for any hope of edginess in rock jazz or blues despite the all-star line-up of great musicians including robert randolph john mayer and the late great billy preston this album is about as interesting as ansalad sandwich,97,5
1330,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,i have about everything eric clapton has recorded and some of my favorite songs are on this cd this is a more laid-back reflective clapton similar to his pilgrim reptile and unplugged cds it reflects the other ec that some of his long-time fans like me treasure along with his blues cds there has not as much sizzling guitar here although you might check out one day to hear the master playing blues guitar as good as it gets but there has a lot more depth perhap it is because I have heard after midnight cocaine layla and more about 100 times more than i needed to or perhaps it is because I am about his age and and past needing adrenalin rushes but i like this eric clapton a lot he has more subtle thoughtful and blues-y he has more of the ensemble musician he always wanted to be ec grew up deal with it,147,6
1331,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this is good stuff his cover of love comes to everyone led me to buy the george harrisons original only to find out that eric plays the opening riffs,29,7
1332,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,for about the first time I have found amazon out-priced this cd is available at best buy for 1399 i do almost all my shopping here but from now on I shall be more careful with comparison shopping before placing an order,40,8
1333,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,the lyrics might as well of come from a pleasant housewife shortly after digesting a particularly interesting issue of people magazine this album is squarely for people who enjoy pasteurized reggae pat boone soul and musak blues the production is glossy unbearably plastic impersonations of lively musicianship in short the album has no soul this music is best enjoyed while chatting with your elderly aunts and uncles over crackers and cheap imitation cheese avoid at all costs and enjoy your shopping experience,82,9
1334,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this is a different clapton album it is not string bending blues but it is good music so he decided to do something different if you want crossroads buy the record i have been a fan since i was a teen a while ago and i dare say i have every ec album this guy has been around for more than forty years and he is like fine wine he just keeps getting better he is happy he has a family he is sober what is wrong with that doug mizell,91,10
1335,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,i give it two stars just because it is clapton but this record is a cure for insomnia in short this album is one of claptons worst ever,27,11
1336,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,some people have a problem with eric claptons solo career because he has a habit of releasing lots of uninteresting laid back music back home has a really good song called revolution that is groovy and influenced by reggae it is worth owning for this song alone,45,12
1337,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,the sound of this album is very relaxed and joyful eric looses his shoulder round into a comfortable slope it is nicely laid back yet has some vitality,28,13
1338,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,clapton has evolved and is writing good songs that reflect maturity both musically and personally i have seen clapton live and it is this newer material in which he shines and plays the most passionately this album is mostly soul / blues songs mixed with a few acoustic numbers all are well written and claptons guitar comes through distinctly and soulfully the best songs with classic clapton guitar solos are one day and run home to me for me i like to hear lyrically soulful songs reflecting something real like longing and family and then have clapton apply his guitar expertise bringing these songs to an emotional head for those longing for the old clapton it was and is great material but the man has evolved,122,14
1339,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,clapton took a beating for this cd it was given mediocre status at best by critics and fans alike why do we want our artists to be sin eaters clapton happy is clapton happy are not we happy for him okay fair is fair the opening track is a little self absorbed and weak the musicianship rocks but the lyrics are trite the second one is not much better after this although the cd really picks up the songs are well crafted the lyrics do not swerve back into limbo territory piece of my heart is better than any sway love song I have heard in a while although we are not living in romantic times back home the finishing set does confirm that clapton has been on quite a journey but he has ready to put aside the weary journeyman in favor of the settled stable soul what has wrong with that this cd is not erics best but it is also not a throw-away open your mind and let clapton open his heart,171,15
1340,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you if you are looking for a great guitar cd this is not it i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and claptons comes to a screeching halt with this of all the eric clapton cds that i like this is not one of them I am glad clapton is now in a happy place and deservedly so but this cd just does not do it for me,98,16
1341,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,i find this to be a very good album the first two songs are really wonderful and clapton also does a great cover of george harrisons love come to everyone the song revolution is also among the best tracks here i really do not understand all those negative reviews must clapton remain in a narrow musical niche and always give us the same as before clapton wears his maturity well on this cd as this time he offers us something a little different from straighforward rock reggae or blues I have looked forward to playing it every day since i purchsed it to each his own,105,17
1342,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,what is the joke how are coffee and eric clapton alike they both suck without cream well i do not go that far eric has made some really great albums primarily in the 1970s but still this album is such watered down and contrived garbage that it is impossible to listen to without getting I shall primarily because the man behind this music is so talented and capable of so much more i actually took this to record store to sell and the guy passed saying they had too many of this one stocked,92,18
1343,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,that is what i feel after listening to this album blah i tried very hard to find this records groove but easy listening music is not my thing ec the guitar god is most certainly alseep if not totally dead the few times i heard his stratocaster come alive the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference the music itself is lackluster and uninspiring there are no stand-out tracks and every song sounds like it could have been written by any amateur songwriter with such a great backing band and top-notch guests this record should have caught fire and burned strong the only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production to me it looks like ec has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing very sad,141,19
1344,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this cd is a must to add to your cd collection i own almost every cd of ecs and back home is awesome yes we will always love cocaine sunshine of your love and layla all my personal favorites but be open to his new stuff it is still eric and it is still great music,52,20
1345,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this is the master at work great songwirting great music and superb performance these are songs that will stay with us and bear repeated listening the cd is filled with new classics this is clapton at his peak of musicianship tasteful upbeat and a joy to listen to forget the naysayers if you like clapton get this one,58,21
1346,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,I am glad ec is happy but sometimes tragedy youth and passion is able to make music alive and meaningful with feelings now he has playing the home scene at 60 years old this is pleasant pop but not rock maybe at 60 I shall crave easy listening too it is a nice package with a 51 dvd version in a dual disc with a normal cd mix at the moment on amazon there are 158 used copies available some under 3 so what does that tell you for that price it is ok but do not expect the usual guitar licks or pyrotechnics,97,22
1347,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,surprised that this is not your classic clapton but back home is not a bad disc i think that it is about time that he has taking aback from the every day stuff that is been broadcasted over the airwaves do not get me wrong i own everything clapton but it is time to let him do what makes him comfortable how many of you were not fans of his nothing but the blues personally i thought that was the man doing what he loved best playn the blues so if you do not care for this one pull out an old commercial airwave tune and enjoy ec is still putting out the tunes,107,23
1348,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,eric clapton is 60 something let him the alone if you do not like his output here go listen to wheels of fire for the zillionth time and pretend that half of it is not dated and boring listen to the album in it is proper context he has earned the right to make the music that he wants you have the right to take it or leave it he has not doing another layla ever and he does not have to do one the music here is good period enjoy it if your head is not messed up on clapton mythology,98,24
1349,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,it is true eric claptons best performances are when he is singing and playing the blues his cutting guitar licks and passionate vocals on previous releses like disraeli gears layla and other love songs and from the cradle are certainly great a performances however back home erics newest release evokes a different side of the man the mood is a jovial one with some spunk and spirit thrown in for good measure some folks say that erics guitar is quite muffled i partially disagree as such songs as one day and lost and found feature some good guitar embelleshments i appreciate several other tunes that show eric in a happy go luck spirit maybe this release is not quite erics best material but i have to say that it is nice to see a different tone to this true legend of contemporary music,141,25
1350,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,with back home eric clapton has released an easy listening album the question is why would anyone listen to eric clapton for sappy pop music his talent is his guitar not his voice if i wanted pop i would listen to paul mccartney erics voice is okay but not great and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here it does not compare to his better cds in any way i know that clapton has nothing against pop he has played with every one of the beatles at concerts and is featured on george harrisons solo albums with george and ringo however he can not sing a pop song like george can and on this cd he does not play the guitar as well as george and eric did on their classic collaborations like while my guitar gently weeps and badge i hope his next studio cd is a cream re-union album like the recent cream re-union concert perhaps going back to playing the guitar while jack bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut,177,26
1351,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,before this album came out eric said he wanted to make a rock pop album i thought he might have done something along the lines of his first solo album from 1970 that was one of his finest this one is a pointless stinker no inventive guitar playing or memorable songs two stars because he is clapton but no more than that,62,27
1352,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this album is very journeyman-esque another brilliant effort by one of the greatest guitarists to ever grace this earth there is nothing here to criticize,25,28
1353,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,i think this album features some of the best music he has ever done it has a smooth sound smooth blues i would like to see more music produced like this,32,29
1354,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,this is not a rockin eric clapton cd but it is an excellently sung listening cd eric claptons singing will surprise those who carefully listen to this very personal cd it is eric claptons vocals that highlight this work eric clapton lists his influences in the cd booklet and states that these artists have taught him to listen from the results in this cd we hear that eric clapton is an excellent listener eric claptons guitar work is exeptional as always but does not stand out like his vocals mr claptons playing is very good as always,97,30
1355,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,claptons inspiration has been replaced by some new boring forgettable elevator songs I am sorry to say that reptile was a very good soft album for me this one not i can not imagine clapton playing these songs on stage hope the set of his 2006 tour will not be only based on this album maybe this time you should try a cream reissue show on dvd,68,31
1356,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,i have collected most of claptons albums for the past 20 years and believe back home is one his best ever there is wide diversity in the genre not just blues which I have come to expect and enjoy but a mix of reggae stevie wonder influences and just generally upbeat tunes the guitar solo on one day is awesome and his tribute to george harrison is reminiscent of the layla episode recommended without any reservation,75,32
1357,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,I shall sum all these back home supporters andsayers if you liked reptile then you will like this i put them in my cd player and play them one after another like a two cd album and it works i like them both not five stars because a lot of his acoustic and electric guitar work gets drowned out by background singers and production if you do not have a good stereo system most people do these days you will miss the suttle strings,80,33
1358,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,eric clapton is a true artist singer songwriter and above all guitar player art is in the eye or in this case ear of the beholder i would not want my clapton music to be the same thing over and over that is what acdc u2 and rap music is for this artist is worth every bit of the hype and myth that is ever been told and this cd is as good as he has ever been do not listen to the whiners get this cd and enjoy something different and good,91,34
1359,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,while being a perfectly decent workmanlike little collection of songs some even written by himself there is absolutely nothing special about this disc nothing to recommend it he is for quite obvious reasons a guitar icon so you always have to tune in just in case but this I am afraid is not going to be the one to break the somnambulistic spell cast by so many of his recent efforts,68,35
1360,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,it does my heart good to see clapton enjoying life and this release reflects just that do yourself a favor pick up this disc listen without prejudice sorry folks this is not layla and enjoy life with him you will be glad you did god bless you eric,47,36
1361,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,after one listen particularly after the jigging so tired i started liking this album immediately it is an easy-listening / bluesy album about love introspection back home comes to mind family and belonging i do not understand why people only listen to just eric claptons guitar and not his vocal the singers vocal as well as his / her instrument is what sets the mood for the song just like that saying in death of a salesman it is not what you say it is how you say it and here eric clapton says it well he has happy he has living life to it is fullest and he wants his audience to know it a person does not always have to be depressed in order to make good music eric clapton is one of thee best musicians that have ever lived next to bob dylan give the man a break,140,37
1362,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,i have been a fan of eric clapton since he was in cream and have every one of his cds i think that mr clapton has earned the right to let his fans know that he has found love and happiness in his beautiful wife and children i think he has accomplished that without being untrue to his roots i for one and happy that he has found happiness and i am enjoying this toe-tapping cd,76,38
1363,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,hey everyone even eric is allowed to make a buck after listening to this disc that is the conclusion i came to i can only speak for myself but i do not listen to eric to hear him sing i listen to hear him play his guitar the guitar playing is almost non-existent the mix on the vocals and other instruments drowns him out when he does play the songs are ok but none of them really stand out if i could return this disc i would i know i will not be listening to it i was glad when i heard eric was doing something new and not just another pale imitation of robert johnson but this has no bite i just can not believe that when they listened to this prior to releasing it they thought it was good i guess I shall just have to listen to the beano album,148,39
1364,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,the brown shoes should have been enough of a give away ec phoned this one in,15,40
1365,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,while listening to this cd it becomes obvious that mr clapton is in a much happier place these days and I am honestly happy about that although that can influence some guys to write great music it seems to not be the case with this one at this point in time i bought this without hearing it first a major no-no of mine for obvious reasons and once again i have been taught why that is never a goodif you have enjoyed bluesy guitar heavy tunes of erics in the past you will not find even one of them here the guitar work is mixed in there somewhere but only rarely does it stand out in my humble opinion with the exception of the first song the entire thing well stinks i wish him the best with it although maybe it will strike a chord with somebody else,145,41
1366,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,eric clapton is my favorite musician period so needless to say i always look forward to a new ec album it seems however that after winning a million grammys for unplugged eric has forgotten how to rock do not get me wrong i love some of erics acoustic work unfortunately this album sounds like something an artist puts out when they are contractually obligated to put out so many albums and the record company is pestering you for something and you just want to get them off of your back hopefully the recent reunion with cream will inspire ec to return back home to rock,102,42
1367,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,if you wanted something like unplugged for goodness sake do not buy this album it is just not wonderful i think that i will give it away if i can find anyone who wants it,34,43
1368,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,i have to admit i almost completely stopped listening to ec about 30 years ago there have been moments of excelence me and mr johnson riding with king unplugged and just one night however after ec first solo cd things went downhill and have continued to slide ever since eric needs to play the blues to sound good not 461 ocean boulevard or the other nonsense he has recorded over the years this cd is no exception it fits in with the majority of his past work i used to think clapton really appreciated the blues if you want real blues go buy john hammond or charlie musselwhite john lee hooker and more and as far as clapton being the god of guitar open your ears to sonny landreth al dimeola john hammond ry cooder jeff beck and the list goes on and on sorry eric glad i just listened to this and never bought it,152,44
1369,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,a few decent tracks such as george harrisons love comes to everyone however for the most part ec sings to sub standard r b ballads which may work for some but not for slowhand in addition the first track slowly ends with a baby crying back home is a long way from 461 ocean boulevard eric you can do better than this,61,45
1370,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,if you buy this disc buy is used get it cheap because its booooorrrrriiiiinnnnnggggg this guy used to be god now it is very sweet very nice songs about sweet nice things and no guitar that is like watching shaq bowl maybe it peaks your interest for a second but it is not worth much energy to pursue i kept waiting and waiting for something akin to guitar buzz rifts something nope not here let us go bowling i can not recall being this disappointed in a disc cepting for santanas new one which is even worse retire gentlemen let someone else play they may actually want to,113,46
1371,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,I shall be brief and blunt the new ec disc is slick clean and rather pedestrian i have been a loyal follower and fan of ec since first hearing cream on los angeless first free-form fm radio station in the mid-late 60s i believe he has always been and is now a stellar artist so it is not without some perspective that i opine on this recent effort the references to family are great in a scrapbook or photo album on a record album i think no after realizing that what i heard in one of the cuts was a baby crying back in the mix i really had a hard time going through the remaining material it is a little too sappy it is wonderful he is happy and i suppose for some many it is pleasing to hear that happiness echoed in his music I shall lay out on this one and hope the next time he gets a bit grittier no i do not believe his material has to be dark or that he has to maintain the tormented artist persona but this is a bit too far up on the happy-meter,187,47
1372,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,it sounds almost like clapton woke up in the 70s when he made this album and not the 70s according to eric clapton and cream but the lame stereotypical 70s i love much of his stuff but this not so much,41,48
1373,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,i never thought i would write something like this is a very nice album about eric clapton however it really seems as if he has found some peace and some sense of home and family as usual there is excellent production and musicianship but as others have noted his guitar playing takes a back seat this go around eric has often changed direction style and challenged himself to bare his feelings and this album is significant in that it displays where he is as a human being today the fact that he played again with john mayall and regrouped with cream shows that he has come to termes with who and where he is as as a musician and is not content to just put out expected product not for everyone but great work as usual,135,49
1374,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,eric the singer takes precedence over clapton the magician guitarist and what you get is an extremely ordinary set of songs thar eminently forgettable sorry eric but the intensity that blackie had is entirely missing from this new album,39,50
1375,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,it is hard to improve on clapton but he has managed to out-do himself with this one the music and the story line of the songs go rightthe heart,30,51
1376,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,eric clapton truly has a golden voice and is one of the tastiest guitar players around but this cd with lots of horns added electronics and backing vocals sounds like a good r b album for music on hold elevator music there is one good song on the album one day eric clapton needs to get some sleep and do an album by himself i think this album would have been much better and most people would have enjoyed this album if it was just eric and an acoustic guitar on it,92,52
1377,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,sixty-year-old eric clapton is rocking a little harder again he hardly rocked hard on 2001s reptile this album features one track personally penned by clapton another was written by his late friend ex-beatle george harrison some songs clapton wrote with simon climie who both collaborated on 1998s pilgrim one song has an unusual key change it goes from c to d flat then b flat in certain aspects some songs are similar to those on reptile very good album although hey ec fans would be surprised to know those who did not that clapton reunited with jack bruce and ginger baker for several concerts in may the threesome is known as cream who had a string of hits between 1966 and 1969 cream disbanded in 1969 due to the strain of all three members being major stars individually the reunion concerts inspired the recording of an album and a dvd counterpart those who read and understand music would immediately figure this out,154,53
1378,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,something new from ec again mellowing with age he always comes through,11,54
1379,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,in classic clapton fashion mr guitar god has done it again this album delivers more of the proved formula delivered in recent albums like reptile and pilgrim in there is a mix of pop sounds with some blues for us blues hungry i must say i am entirely satisfied with this latest delivery now i can only expect the next which i hope will be another blues cd,68,55
1380,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,why bother to record stuff he most certainly makes up as he goes along jamming where are the songs and if you do not have any songs why the super laid back delivery this record makes me want to go to sleeeeeeep last album mr johnson was all that this album is not this is not back home that was the last album the new one is back in reverse,69,56
1381,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,as a lifelong eric clapton fan I am dissappointed in thie effort or should i say lack of effort eric must have owed the record company an album so he gave them this eric is at his best playing blues because that is were his heart is eric follow your heart,49,57
1382,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,i find this to be one of erics most unique soulful works of all time it is filled with the type of love songs that he admired george harrison for those simple from the heart love songs about what has most important in his life I am a die-hard fan so i had some trepidation too as I have heard from others but it is quite refreshing to hear this side of him and the dvd side of the dualdisc gives you anabout what he was thinking when he wrote the songs i recommend you buy that version who would not be happy for him i know i am i find myself anxious to listen to this album again and again,118,58
1383,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,while i would be willing to listen to clapton play twinkle twinkle little star in the blues mode i find this album is a little more pop than blues or rock i prefer the straight out old fashioned blues guitar from clapton but this is definitely an enjoyable cd,48,59
1384,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,if your a clapton fan you will not be disapointed,9,60
1385,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,if like me you found mr clapton sublime and in the pocket with unplugged me and mr johnson and riding with the king his duet with bb be careful before you purchase this album this is an imitative pastiche of recently fashionable pop cliches 20 years ago for some and 10 years ago for others aside from a couple of nifty flourishes nothing distinguishes this album it sounds like clapton doing kareoke he even cops a lionel ritchie / soul chick groove on one song it is horrible even although his pipes are up to the required high notes so you might want to sit this one out he will be back,109,61
1386,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,having read the reviews i have to say that i am disapponted in how much the reviewers are ripping eric clapton if they are true fans then they ought to realize that clapton is probably the only artist not content to stay within one genre of music he can move easily in and out of reggae blues r b and others i think this album is a very strong album it has some great tunes like one day love do not love nobody and heaven on revolution calpton has been able to duplicate bob marley and the wailers not an easy thing to do so when you listen to the album please keep in mind that clapton wants to show how happy he is in his life and that he is not content to be a one trick pony,137,62
1387,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,unfortunately i have to agree with all the other reviewers have had to say i have been an eric fan since the start i even went to see the graffiti you know the one this is not the worst eric cd but only because i can not bring myself to making it his worst like others I am glad he has happy at last but this purile stuff is not what the fans want i really do want to hear the strat scream just one more time please god let the albert hall recordings do the job,94,63
1388,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,his weakest cd yet in my opinion maybe he has just got tired over the years very slow and toned down i hope he gets back to more blues type music a little disappointing,34,64
1389,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,a very poppy cd with the girl singers back unfortunately sounds more like his early 80s stuff which i found back then to be his worst stuff i guess eric can not please everyone but this cd is a real downer very little guitar solos however erics voice is great,49,65
1390,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,this album is pretty damn good it may not be up to claptons standards but it is near impossible to overcome his stuff when he was in his prime this album would be good and rated highly if it was released by any other artists today but the artist is the factor that changes the grade please judge my music not by the artists past click yes if you agree with me no if you do not please be honest,75,66
1391,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,this is the track listing on ecs home page 1 so tired 2 say what you will 3 going left 4 love do not love nobody 5 revolution 6 lost and found 7 heaven 8 love comes to everyone 9 one day 10 one track mind 11 run home to me 12 back home track 7 on the cd being sold is incomplete and track 8 is not the same title,70,67
1392,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,diet pop corn is the best way to describe this cd it has nothing sweet sounding is made from hot air and is corny it is almost like clapton is the saturday morning cartoon version of himself i understand the song subjects are important to him but it is tiresome and boring and is not worthy of such a legend the first song on the disc so tired pretty much sums up the rest of the cd either he has tired or just damn lazy if this were a james taylor album i would say it is pretty good but as an eric clapton album it blows,103,68
1393,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,a great contemporary recording of todays themes as expected i felt cheated when eric and bb got together to do covers i expected the greats to come up with new and improved old blues who cares about slow hand or 461 ocean blvd or layla or cream or blues breakers when it is already out there to savour and enjoy we want new and improved old blues and this is what back home is all about being awe respect combined with talent and wonder again by a classic musician and his electric and acoustic guitars great comeback,108,69
1394,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,he has played for decades and this is his 20th or something solo album after the supergroups of yardbirds bluesbreakers blind faith dominoes and cream he has told stories through his songs like layla tears in heaven circus and more and back home album is no exception clapton penned opening track so tired fits this personal stories list as well as the rest of the tunes on the album musically it is soulful than ever with traditional sounds and instruments like guitars hammond organ horns and so on covers from george harrison spinners and stevie wonder blends in and the playing is sharp and a joy to listen this album continues the feeling of recent albums reptile and one more car with the same musicians and a laid-back electric-unplugged like clapton himself described reptile sounding tunes,120,70
1395,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,very disappointed in this effort by clapton painful listening I shall take his blues efforts anyday this is as boring as it gets,22,71
1396,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,yes i am a diehard clapton fan and i too was hoping for a bring the walls down rock and blues album but this is an excellent piece of work vocally ec is at his best the variety of styles keeps the album moving i was actually surprised each time a new track started because each song was so different the lyrics are beautiful as well as meaningful the guitar work although subtle most of the time is still excellent if you do not like the soulful sound of love do not love nobody then apparently you just do not like music I am going left is also outstanding no need writing about each song it is a great cd with maybe 2 weak songs the limited edition dual disc is well worth the money the ec interview adds insight to the album,138,72
1397,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,crap without inspiration and repeats themes and musical patterns built by the record industry,14,73
1398,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,what is goin on here thank god i did not buy this pitiful attempt of music my poor friend did buy it and asked me to listen i told him it might serve better as a coaster for his beer glass so his wife does not get upset for leaving rings on the furniture what is clapton doing i believe in the past ten years he has been steeped in banality but this offering is horrific please listen to the bluesbreakers with eric clapton for a true understanding of this mans brilliance layla for some of his best songwriting and vocal phrasings i never thought i could ever think this let alone express it but mr clapton please put away your guitar until you once again discover inspiration you are embarrassing yourself and tarnishing your legacy it breaks my heart to make these comments but at least my friends wife will be happy peace,152,74
1399,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,has the man who blistered our ears with mayall and cream both the original and the recent reunion shows who stood toe-to-toe with duane who shared the spotlight with the lesser-known-but-perhaps-more-talented albert lee and with various authentic bluesmen and who is capable of so much more than just mailing in stuff like this listless set of elevator music fallen under the spell of a mind controlling cult has he been seen with tom cruise surrounded himself with too many yes men and women or simply gone over to the bland side a fate worse than the dark side and a place where rock and blues have been eviscerated by a music industry that shares more than it might imagine with factory farming where animals live short miserable lives cannibalizing the otherwise unusable scraps of their predecessors,136,75
1400,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,when i was introduced to clapton through from the cradle my jaw dropped that was the kind of blues that my soul melted under unfortunately back home is not even 1 of what from the cradle was i was so disappointed when i listened to a steady stream of happy go lucky bouncy tracks that it reminded me when someone somehow slipped me one of his early cream creations and me thinking that i was about to listen to an early blues band i hope the next record he releases will have some b ls,94,76
1401,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,when back home was released music critic stephen thomas erlewine sarcastically remarked that the album is just about being home which if the center photo of clapton at home with his three young daughters and wife is to be believed looks alarmingly similar to the set of thomas the tank engine complete with a painted rainbow shining through the window that just about says it all eric clapton is a highly professional musician backed by a competent band you can put this album on and not one of your guests will be offended chances are they will not really notice it at all this is slick nondescript and utterly harmless pop music and if that is your thing go get it right away just do not confuse this man with the eric clapton of the 60s and early 70s the eric clapton who played the blues and lamented the fact that his voice was not loud gruff and whiskey-hoarsened like howlin wolfs stop quoting stephen as if his opinion holds alot of weight any one that gives 4 and 5 stars to the likes of ashlee simpson is an idiot and that is what erlewine did he is a moronic reviewer,195,77
1402,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,back home finds eric clapton espousing on the joys of being at home with his family while he deserves domestic happiness the album harkens back to his worst commercial instincts sounding very much like the mor sounds of his worst efforts like august and pilgrim the album has a professional and over-produced sound that is perfectly made for adult contemporary radio the one highlight is the thoughtful and loving cover of mr claptons good friend george harrisons love comes to everyone it is an obscure album track from 1979s george harrison album and mr clapton puts his heart into and it is a touching tribute to mr harrison too bad the rest of the album lacks this loving touch and feels like a bore,124,78
1403,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,let us face it you purchase a clapton cd to hear him rip away with some blues but alas on this cd he tries to do much and that leads him astray from his roots the result is a big dissappointment i would much rather have had a cd come out of the crossroads guitar festival dvd then this and i am really looking forward to the cream reunion cd that is scheduled to come out next month skip this cd and buy just the good songs on itunes,88,79
1404,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,eric clapton is not just a muscian he has my friend for over 30 years his music has formed much of the soundtrack of my life from the angst ridden power of layla expressing my own pain with unrequited love to the generational passion of fathers eyes precisely describing my feelings as both a son and a father of two sons in back home we find an eric clapton who has found joy in family and as one friend to another i say good job and thanks for letting us share that joy the first release revolution has a feel similiar to i shot the sheriff and the george harrison love comes to everyone brings to mind the stage full of incredible muscians that was the concert for george but the best songs of the cd are the title track and run home to me sounding like river of tears it is packed with emotion and again as a father i can not help but wanting to remind both of my sons that they can always run back home thanks eric for sharing your life with us the pain the hard journey and now the joy,192,80
1405,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,it seems that eric clapton has been working more in the past several years than most veteran rock / blues musicians of his generation rather than resting on his previous success all this and with a rather young family on back home clapton shows us just how versatile he has become switching from playing old blues songs as on his two previous releases to more modern current trends in music like on back home i enjoyed the variation of material on this disc his guitar does take a back seat to his vocals but his vocals are in top form throughout the disc the band and the recording mix is supurb since i like his vocals as much as his guitar playing i rate this disc a winner,126,81
1406,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,anyone who has followed eric claptons career or seriously collected his music knows that this is an artist who faithfully follows his heart his body of work spans musical styles and every human emotion his 1998 album pilgrim was an entire album about heartbreak and lost love back home is a joyful upbeat album about found love eric is finally at peace and content in his life and his latest album reflects that as much as i admire eric clapton the blues interpreter and rock guitarist i deeply appreciate eric clapton the loving father and husband and musical craftsman back home is a rich and fulfilling product of the latter the songs on back home are exquisitely produced and energetic many of the tracks include memorable hooks and melodies something sorely missing from modern popular music and there are intimate lyrics that lie bare the heart of the artist ultimately this is a very courageous album to produce will love and joy sell to eric claptons audience maybe maybe not but as the songs on this album attest the most important things in life can be found back home and that is where eric claptons heart is today,198,82
1407,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,message to eric clapton you are still one of the greatest rock / blues guitarists to ever grasp a pick we do not buy your music to listen to you sing melancholy love songs we want to hear you play the guitar with some grit and gusto i can not wait to purchase the albert hall reunion dvd to see you at your best,59,83
1408,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,I am a big big clapton fan and i have to say this is a totally forgetable album of muzak eric where has the,23,84
1409,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,hey I am from dallas tx and have been a huge clapton fan ever since i was 5 years old in 1990 i think that this is an absolutely wonderful album highlights for me include so tired love do not love nobody love comes to everyone one day lost and found and back home all the songs are great and I am really glad that claptons singing happy songs because he has in that part of his life right now and i really admire him for wanting to be with his family he deserves that but I shall be glad when he goes on tour for this album because i want to hear these songs live anyway I shall close now by saying that i love claptons music and hopefully I shall meet him someday,128,85
1410,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,3 stars for the album and 4 1/2 for the dvd side high resolution audio not one of erics best efforts but a very comforting album mostly dedicated to the songwriters he admires most over the years and to his family if you are a clapton fan and have learned not to expect too much you will enjoy it i bought the dualdisc version and am very impressed with the audio quality on the dvd side which for once is in real dvd-audio both 2 channel and 51 surround using 24 bit sampled at 48khz this is so welcome since most dvd sides on dualdiscs only provide dolby digital sound which is way too compressed,113,86
1411,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,after buying back home i was somewhat dissapointed after a first listen i loved claptons me and mr johnson stuff and I am the first one to jump on his derek and the dominoes cream and blues stuff this cd does not represent that side of him however after a second listen through i realized that there is much to love here if you are a soft rock clapton fan this cd is very eclectic jumping from reggae and soft rock to r b and blues many sweet sounding songs that work well together on the album definately worth a listen and i think I shall like it even better a third time through,112,87
1412,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,clapton is out of his melancholy mood here nice backup musicians too i enjoyed it the first time i listened to it,22,88
1413,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,eric clapton with his usual fine entourage of studio musicians has given us a real mixed bag of material on his latest release back home i found it very uneven with clapton sounding like he is lost in this musical maze having been a fan of clapton from the start of his career i always got the impression that his comfort zone was as a session musician a member this release has some fine moments but in my opinion it is a mediocre effort from an otherwise great musician and his talented crew,86,89
1414,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,eric claptons new cd for about a month that is all i thought about and when i first heard the song revolution i knew this cd was not gon na be like his early stuff it would appear as if the rock out guitar soloing days are over but that is ok with me in his interviews he talks about how he has really happy right now with his life any fan of his would know that that is all that matters he has playing how he feels and it makes me wonder why all these people are complaining about it being to pop and stuff he has writing about he feels if u just really do not like this album maybe you should think are you really an eric clapton fan now with all of this that i have to say why only give it 4 stars because i do not think it is his best but it is up there there are many enjoyable songs on here at as much blues as some of his other latest cds but again i sure do not mind,174,90
1415,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,clapton is one of my favorite artists primarily because of his blues background which is a strong influence on his best albums with the outstanding recent robert johnson sessions i was expecting something exciting but this is not exciting or for the most part even interesting it is okay but not good if you are a clapton fan you may enjoy it or at least a couple of the tracks all in all it is a bit of a dissappointment too michael boltonish a little sappy your mom would probably think this was a pretty good record i look forward to the next clapton release,107,91
1416,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,I am a clapton fan because of his blues / rock background the songs on this albums are not even good pop songs i was totally disappointed when i listened to this album because i listened to it objectively if you did not know it was clapton this cd would not get any 5 star reviews the ec fan club might enjoy it but do not buy this album thinking it will be anything you would want to listen to more than once,75,92
1417,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,i agree with the guy who said this simon climie messes up everything just listen to pilgram it is not very good as soon as i saw his name i thought another album ruined every once in a while clapton turns out a good album from the cradle journeyman money and cigerettes and more the day he decided the guitar would not be the main focus things went south he is still a good blues guitarist but if you want to hear great songs great singing and super guitar riffs and solos pick up jimmy thackerys sinner street drive to survive or healin ground this guy is in stevie ray vaughns league the old clapton dominoes cream mayall will always be one of my favorites but i just do not want to hear sappy crappy bull and boring guitar,132,93
1418,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,I have been a clapton fan for many years he is one of a handful of artists i buy regularly because I am interested to see what he has up to now i love this cd while it is similar in some ways to pilgrim and reptile the major difference between those albums and back home is that overall back home is a happy upbeat solid effort which definitely makes it worth a listen and a purchase artists will never make all of their fans happy all of the time the only person they really have to make happy is themselves i think each of erics musical styles are represented on this album in one way or another and he does sound happy and content i was pleasantly surprised by back home it is a great cd,133,94
1419,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,i really hate to give this record only one star like one reviewer just said eric was coming off the cream reunion and a really good robert johnson record and tour and maybe we were expecting a corner turn in his somewhat laid back studio attempts over the last few years reptile pilgrim this record makes those seem energetic let us face it eric is a great talent but people should know where their strenghts lie songwriting was never a real strong suit for him we all know that his strenght lies in his guitar and in his love for the blues none of these are present on this disc his tales of domesticity in these tunes are almost downright depressing i know that people are so tired when they have kids every parent knows already what we need is to be uplifted and this record falls way short,149,95
1420,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,are you the same person that you were 40 years ago then why should eric clapton be,17,96
1421,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,1.0,negative,ok first of all i am a huge clapton fan i have most of the records seen him a ton of times and was excited when this cd came in the mail after listening half way thru i was very upset the music is garbage i mean how can you go from the cream reunion and sessions for robert j to this smooth jazz pile of rubble not even guest shots from winwood and robert randolph can help this thing out clapton scatting is not myof a goodi will say revolution is a great song if the whole record had more of that vibe it would have been a good addition in my opinion this is worse than pligrim thanks to simon climie for screwing up claptons career,131,97
1422,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,2.0,negative,this is not the usual ec album it is all pop music except for one track there are no good guitar solos it is all really happy for the blues fan i would highly recomend that you do not listen to this album if your a pop fan then you will probaly like this because you like crappy music this is a horrible cd and whoever told mr clapton that it was good should be punched in the face,77,98
1423,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,identification hate to say it but i will this is a decent album i am a really big clapton fan and it hurts to say that i guess if you are looking for another from the cradle or journey man you will not find it in this album this blues man has aged and so has this taste this album shows he has matured i went on release day to grab this album and i enjoyed listening to it but i still love the classics and this cd will probably not get as much play in my cd player if you love clapton and his ever changing ways then i say snatch this album up but if you are looking for his earlier days of classic rock or blues you will only find traces,132,99
1424,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5.0,positive,eric clapton is quite a guitarist his new album is real solid great songs to sing along too I am going left is one of his songs that is a big sing along song before this album was released one track mind and revolution was released on itunes as singles if you like eric clapton i would say to get this album,61,100
1425,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4.0,positive,like van morrison many of us have a nostalgic connection to eric clapton dating back nearly forty years we hope that each new record will catapault us back to the emotional sunshine of the 60s and 70s a return to those days when the music was new and ground-breaking it is not to be because it can not be new anymore but it can be refreshing this the case with back home eric clapton has gotten back to combining blues reggae and r b into catchy tunes that leave you satisfied perhaps not in a league with journeyman back home does enter that territory although pilgrim was excellent musically it was a very difficult record to listen to because of it is themes and therefore had a limited repeat-listening lifespan reptile lacked punch the return to his catchy pop sensibilities is quite welcome we probably will not experience the oh wow of a 461 ocean boulevard again but this is a fine reminder of how it used to be this is a fun record and recommended,171,101
1448,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4.0,positive,as another reviewer said this release is better than the first which i also liked but did overrate initially because the focus is on popular music associated with halloween rather than on scary classical music the amount of vocals works very well it must be kept in mind that chip davis actually got his first big break through novelty country songs and so it should not be surprising that he can do great steamroller arrangements even with fairly straightforward vocals some tracks are better than others again i have to agree that the davis originals are among the weakest although the trafik techno remix of creatures of the night is fantastic but overall it is a fun halloween party album listening to the sound samples should tell you if this will be your cup of tea or not just keep in mind this is designed for a fun halloween party rather than as something to scare you,157,0
1449,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1.0,negative,why does chip davis refuse to produce his music on a more regular basis granted we now have music for each season and now every holiday known to man thanks in part to chips newest release halloween 2 halloween 1 was quite enough i give him kudos for his effort but there are so many other beautiful songs he has yet to add his steamroller touch to hopefully one day he will wise up this album sounds as if he has totally lost sight of his 18th century rock and roll base and has gone for more 21st century midi trash on top of reissuing music that we have enjoyed for the past 20 years his fresh aire series was wonderful as are chips other albums yellowstone saving the wildlife but has the steamroller run out of steam as a diehard ms fan i was shocked and appalled that he ventured yet again into halloween with less attractive results he should give us what we really want more christmas music and new material with the steamroller sound we grew to love and adore,181,1
1450,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4.0,positive,hahaha what can i say chip davis and his cohorts make music fun christmas halloween or mello me out after a rough day mannheim steamroller knows how to hit just the right buttons the mix of music and sounds made for laughs and giggles from the trick-or-treaters who came to my house,51,2
1451,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2.0,negative,the songs are not spooky nor are they up to par with my halloween liking i may have been expecting something more scary,23,3
1452,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5.0,positive,we bought this and 2 other cds great for all ages putting these on outside during trick-or-treating really livens up everyone is spirits even in the middle of the week,27,4
1453,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5.0,positive,perfect music for the halloween party manaheim steamroller produces great music for whatever season that needs to be very good music,21,5
1454,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4.0,positive,this collection features three discs when i ordered i thought i was getting three cds of halloween music that i can play in the car or in my boombox instead i got one cd of halloween songs one of halloween sounds and a dvd of such songs as creatures of the night the songs were refreshing retakes of older songs such as black magic woman psycho monster mash the theme from the addams family as well as new titles such as trick or treat all of these songs show characteristic mannheim style and were enjoyable to listen to even although there were three cds i think it was a good value for under 20,114,6
1455,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1.0,negative,i got this because i was looking for something new for halloween and i saw they had covered the dark shadows theme and the dr who theme and it came with a sound fx cd and a dvd then i listened to it the out date keyboard sounds most likely a roland d5 and their love of turning everything into techno made this beyond wretched the fx cd was just more effected 80s keyboard sounds and the dvd was nothing but goofy self aware music videos of their songs oh I am sorry and a dance instruction video let us not forget the asinine tag on the back of the package over half million dollars in video this is exactly what is on the back of the box i have nowhat they could have spent that much on they got ripped off and so will you if you like these guys and their dated techno sound then this is the album for you however if your under 50 and want a competent halloween soundtrack run screaming from this abomination,179,7
1456,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1.0,negative,if you are looking for halloween music that you grew up on this is not it i love manheim steamroller but this does not ever come close to what i was expecting,32,8
1457,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4.0,positive,bought this cd for a gift person loved it lots of music for the price,15,9
1458,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2.0,negative,there are three cds in this package but they are not identified as 1 2 and 3 so it is easy to mix them up each has some good music and some hokey or kinky tracks it would have been much better to deliver the good classical stuff on one cd so it would not be interrupted by the less attractive music i like about one third of it but it is mixed throughout so i probably will not listen to it often,81,10
1459,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5.0,positive,i always expect the best from manheim steamroller but this surpassed my expectations it is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to listed to you will love it,31,11
1460,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2.0,negative,this just does not sound as although mr davis had his heart in it or put much effort into it the songs covered tended to have parts chopped out of them and for tv themes there has not much one can afford to remove the dr who theme is by far the worst example only a couple of bars of the actual tune survive the rest is large quantities of unimaginative padding heavy on the drum machines for example the repeated tonic / sus4 that leads into a mutilated superstition will drive you batty hey maybe that is the tie-in with halloween please mr davis get your muse back you can do better than this,109,12
1461,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5.0,positive,my husband wanted this cd because of the monster mash song and listens to it all the time halloween or not a great cd,23,13
1462,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,5.0,positive,for anyone who has not heard it you are totally missing out these guys have done it again sheer brilliance the songs just totally get you in the mood for new the season and are great to listen to while decorating buy this cd,43,14
1463,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,somewhere between nickelback and linkin park you will find the band saliva and their fifth studio effort blood stained love story save for the somewhat overdone ladies and gentlemen bsls is cut for cut a solid record old-school fans of saliva may be put off by the lack of heaviness but those who looked away after 2003s survival of the sickest are invited back instantly via accessible matured song writing at under 40 minutes in length bsls has no room for filler and thankfully there is not any although as mentioned earlier ladies and gentlemen may take some time to grow on you fans of alternative metal nu-metal and medium heavy rock will more than likely enjoy blood stained love story,119,0
1464,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,this appears to be the saliva ballads cd the band from the first couple cds is long gone and a pop band with a ton of slow ballads has taken their place great band in concert but this does not represent the band at all check out the new fozzy all that remains reloaded cd if you want to hear an incredible rock / metal cd with zero ballads,65,1
1465,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,i have been a fan since every six seconds i saw the video for your disease and i was hooked this cd is different but it has alot going for it sure they are leaning towards a more mellow sound at times but that is just the nature of growing up critics write off 90 os the rock bands that have ever recorded this cd is cool it is fast slow in between sad happy and pissed off all at the same time i have met the band twice and to meet them is to understand their music even more they have a way of singing what they feel and not worry because they know people will relate to them best tracks ladies and gentlemen black sheep going under,129,2
1466,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1.0,negative,this album is poppy whiney and overall a catastrophe i was utterly surprised to see that only about 2 or 3 tracks rock and the rest is mainstream sounding garble i agree that saliva should have changed and evolved their sound from their previous albums as the rap / rock was getting outdated and overplayed but this was an extreme case of the woaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhs skip it,64,3
1467,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,every once in a while a band releases a cd that is great from beginning to end saliva did that with blood stained love story although my first experience with this band is on this cd alone and i have not yet had the pleasure of experiencing their previous works i am looking forward to enjoying their other efforts as well i am not one of these people who expect a band to have a similar sound throughout their careers to me that shows no artistic venture so when any band releases a new cd i enjoy it for the fact that it is a new production whatever it is that they saliva have done in the past will be enjoyed as the separate works of art they have produced for my listening pleasure blood stained love story is a great introduction to salivas music for me and i look forward to their future works as well,157,4
1468,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,two and a half years since thier last album and worst the boys from memphis are back with a decent album better than their survival of the sickest 3 stars but not as good as every 6 seconds or back into your system both 45 stars the main reason to me anyway is the growing amount of slower songs the groups puts out shorter than their other albums with only 10 songs 1 is almost a classic 1 i skip 5 are good and the other 3 are ok while it is a decent album and a good one for their fans i prefer their earlier work more 1 85 a nice upbeat track not much lyrics although 2 85 3 8 4 95 my favorite and another upbeat one 5 8 6 7 7 5 8 7 9 75 10 7 check all my reviews,155,5
1469,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,every song on this cd sounds as although these guys sat down and listened to other bands and then tweeked the tune a little the second song on the cd sounds like animals from nickelback if you know who galactic cowboys are then you will recognize ladies and gentlemen and more the best song might be blacksheep but every song on here got copyed from someone,64,6
1470,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1.0,negative,oh wait it is just saliva like this band was original anyways just take every six seconds and mix it in with back into your system and you have this just another generic radio rock disc if you dig other atrocious a rock artists like puddle of theory of a nickeldefaultcreed you will eat this up me just give me origin and informis infinitas inhumani,64,7
1471,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,I have been listening to saliva since every six seconds came out i love just about everything they have done and i think they are just about the best hard rock band out today coherent lyrics with great hard hitting music each album is different but it is the same saliva always evolving never reinventing i love survival of the sickest and blood stained love story is not quite as good overall all the songs are good with one exception and they have a few great songs on this album ladies and gentlemen broken sunday and king of the radio couple decent ballads but who loves them for the ballads however I am glad I am not the only person who heard twister and thought who the he shall is this that song is crap but the rest it still great saliva if you liked any of their previous albums there has no sense in not buying this one i just hope they stick around and the next album leans more to their hard rock roots they need to stick with what they are good at,176,8
1472,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,bought the cd today and feel like i wasted money not as good as the other cds weak is a good word for the cd,25,9
1473,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,it is sad how after they had one hit click click boom that was featured on every single soundtrack known to man that they would make an entire album and have every song sounding almost exactly like that one hit and if it did not sound like it they were sure to mention it somewhere in the song i do not know although there were one or two songs that were decent but i was not crazy about this album,76,10
1474,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1.0,negative,what an awful album thank goodness i listened to tracks online before i went out and bought this junk,19,11
1475,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,blood stained love story is excellent saliva is one of the best rock bands ever track listing 1 ladies and gentlemen 2 broken sunday 3 never going to change 4 king of the stereo 5 one more chance 6 going under 7 twister 8 black sheep 9 starting over 10 here with you,52,12
1476,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,i have to admit that i jumped on the saliva bandwagon when i heard click click boom but once i was on i never had a reason to get off even although their last effort seemed stale in areas it was still a good listen with blood stained love story a natural progression is happening and it seems to suit the band well the album takes a trip in a softer direction at times but still goes through the old neighborhoods that made the band so appealing to me in the first place,93,13
1477,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,i like the album because iam a saliva fan so buy a copy an listen for yourself only you will know if you like it or not,27,14
1478,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,i enjoy listening to the evolution of a band and this is what we are getting with saliva speaking of the evolution of a band check out porcupine tree it is an album i truly enjoyed from beginning to end if you like music with and without the hardif you like music with great variety then go buy this if you just want to stay in yesterday well just stay there that is alright too,73,15
1479,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,i am not a big fan of modern music the tunde down drop f bombs and have the cookie monster sing i overlooked saliva when every 6 seconds came out i likers superstar and click when i would hear it on radio but did not jump to buy it i picked up every 6 seconds in the 200 bin at a used cd place and really liked the band they rocked hard but had a good melody to their songs there was that primal side but you could hear there was something more than just power cords i bought blood stained love story the day it came out and listened about 8 times i really like it there are all sorts of moments here fast and hard and cool melodic even with some leanings to pop this is one of the new bands that i see with staying power and I am even glad to say they did an awesome cd with no f bombs these guys are at the top of my list for favoriate modern rock bands that is a small club for me a rocker over 40,189,16
1480,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1.0,negative,this album is not the saliva i know i loved survival of the sickest and this album is not like that at all with the exception of tracks 1 and 8 the rest must have been someone else,38,17
1481,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,if there has one thing you have to say about this album it is that it is very varied there are many different types of music on the album from straight rock similar to every six seconds to more poppy music similar to back into your system some of it is even reminiscent of their first self-titled album saliva however i can not give the album five stars on principle i agree with other reviewers in that black sheep sounds exactly like animals by nickelback if only a little slower not cool guys not cool other than that a great album you should enjoy if you like back into your system and survival of the sickest,112,18
1482,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,tell me no one else has noticed the similarities between animals by nickelback and black sheep on this album it seems to me saliva slowed it down to try to get people not to notice it besides this the album is mediocre compared to their others ladies and gentlemen definately rocked the res is ok,54,19
1483,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,when i heard ladies and gentlemen i was excited i thought here is going to be a great saliva album instead what we have is another daughtry cd i loved the first saliva album the second had some bubble gum but still some rockin songs the third was raw and a bit immature but still good this album is pop i thought saliva of all bands would not try to be nickelback but the nickelback album at least rocked a little i am very disappointed if you want click click boom and great rock anthems listen to old saliva if daughtry is your thing then this is for you me I shall listen to ladies and gentlemen until i wear it out then I shall move on,124,20
1484,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,being an owner of all of salivas albums i am very impressed with this latest effort from the guys from memphis it is a more polished and mature album however that is not a bad thing it is still hard-driving rock with some good power ballads thrown into the mix as has been stated the song twister is strange to hear from saliva but the rest of the album makes up for it besides what band does not try out different genres of music with varied results there is still plenty of kick-a material to satisfy i would highly recommend this album to anyone whose voice has stopped changing,109,21
1485,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5.0,positive,well although i agree with some of the other reviews saying saliva has slowed down however they do have a few that are still hard but the things is that the slower ones are amazing they really are very good i think the only stupid song on this album that did not make me want to rewind the song was twister i hate the freakin sound however i think this album is defenitaly worth buying and giving it a shot if u like always and weight of the world and even a fan of rest in peices u will love this album,101,22
1486,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,i own all of salivas cds and was stoked to purchase the new one ladies and gentleman is a cool different style of rock song broken sunday is a great track and king of the radio features some old school raprock so to speak that i love to hear from josey there are some soft ballads on here but I have listened to them a few times since i got it yesterday and they are definately startin to grow on me the song twister is completely random and definately does sound pop-rockish it is just completely wierd to here that from saliva they will probably play that one on 965 the buzz here in kansas city anyways i like it overall but survival of the sickest was my favorite album so far but of course i love all the older stuff he shall click click boom was my favorite song for probably around 2 - 3 years,151,23
1487,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,i first listened to this cd while at the gym and i was pumped while listening to ladies and gentleman then the wheels came off what happened to these guys other than track 1 and 5 this was dissapointing and the twister song i could not force myself to even finish listening to that song as with all bands maybe it is time to hang it up boys you are definitely scratching the bottom of the barrel here what a shame atleast your other cds rocked and I am off to the bargain bin,89,24
1488,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2.0,negative,as a proud owner of all salivas past work i was very excited to purchase the newest release yesterday as the album began i was pleased with the opening track and eagerly anticipated more gritty southern rock however much to my dismay instead i received dose after painful dose of soft poppy hook ladden top 40 / american idol-esque songs with the exception of one track near the end the rest of the cd belongs in the easy listening section not rock / metal although i must admit some of the chorus lines are a bit catchy i was hoping for another cd to blast at the gym not fall asleep to this disc now belongs to my girlfriend stocked away next to her chris daughtry kelly clarkson and kelly pickler cds very disappointed,130,25
1489,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,this is salivas fourth major label album and definitely much better then their last album survival of the sickest which seemed rushed and shallow this album is more in vein with their first two albums both of which went gold it has traces of nu-metal and monster ballad in it but that is works my only problem is track 7 twister the band should be named all-saliva rejects because you can tell this song was written to appeal to the all american rejects / emo punk crowd i think they kinda alienated their fan base on this track very fake very with the times josey scott sounds least to say ridiculous on this track and i think he knows it anywho this is a solid album and it is a great pickup especially since many other similar artists have gone by the wayside saliva continues to make driving hard rock that is radio friendly check out tracks 125 and 10 35 - 4 stars,160,26
1490,CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4.0,positive,wow first off so excited to see josey and the boys out with such a great new cd i agree with those that have posted before me this cd is a great first for a new saliva fan heavy enough for the old school fans and with the radio friendly ballads easy to listen too i have all their other offerings totally suggest back into your system as well buy it these songs were meant to get into your head the bridge in ladies and gentlemen is killer do you want it do you need it yep,90,27
1491,Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,honggang ma is exactly right i saw this product in a store loved it is simplicity 31 mpixels for an incredible price i thought what has the catch then i asked about the type of memory the store clerk had nohe climbed a ladder to find the box and still we could not make heads or tails of the info i used the web to find all sorts of reviews nothing specifically mentioned the memory then i found the previous review here at amazon great reviews this settles the issue for me what do you do when on vacation and you simply must buy another mem card with this camera nothing if you are not concerned about this issue then definitely buy this camera you will not find a higher resolution for the price be aware although this is a point and click snapshot camera only,145,0
1492,Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,the main reason i bought this camera is because it has a sd / mmc card i looked at the more expensive dx-3900 and counted it out it did have 2x optical zoon but used the wrong memory for me i own a palm m505 and want to have compatibility with that and my mp3 player even although the other chips may be superior in maximum memory capacity and probably speed i think companies should standardise or we end up wasting our money as they change their minds i purchased a 64 mb mmc chip at amazon quite cheap and it will work in my palm the mp3 player and the kodak camera go figure at least kodak gave us the option in the dx3700 others should but the dx3900,127,1
1493,Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,i did a lot of comparison shopping before eventually deciding on the dx3700 the price of this camera is awesome considering it is in the 31 mp range i was a little worried about the new multi media cards being used compared to the most widely used compact flash cards my fears were quickly subdued when i did a little reseach and noticed that alot of your highend cameras coming out now are switching to the new mmc cards as for pricing on the new cards they are right in line with the compact flash cards these prices came directly from kodaks web site a 16 mb compact flash cost 2599 compared to the new mmc at 2699 also comparable were the 32 mb cards with about a two dollar difference in price I am sure as more cameras begin using the new cards higher memory capacity will come out also this camera was extremely easy to use i was taking pictures about five minutes after i unpacked it and the picture quality is unbelievable,172,2
1494,Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,the pictures are excellent in fact they are among the best for 3-mega digicams this is where the virtues of this camera end the 3700 uses an sd or mmc card that is hard to find once you find them in some retail stores they cost 3 times more than their compared to counterparts sd or mmc are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization yet this camera is bigger than kodak 3900 an excellent camera that uses compared to card therefore this card format does not make any sense another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the sd card is 64 mb as compared with 512 mb for compared to card since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution i tried to order a 64 mb sd card the price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more now i have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever i go the purchase turned out to be a disaster,172,3
1495,Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,first kodak makes you buy aextra 80 bucks although this camera does take good pictures when daylight is sufficient this camera lacks features and with problems no zoom no timer of course no video which is ok here are some real problems 1 this camera makes dark pictures when there is not ample light yes flash is on regular 35 mm even those made by kodak cameras can do much better than that 2 battery life is short do not trust the computer when it says battery life is good you will run out after taking a few shots if you gone to a day trip you must remember to turn it off everytime after you take a pic in order to last a few hours 3 upload from thesometimes give mysterious i / o errors frustrating you may have to try a couple times,146,4
1496,Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,we received this camera as a gift and like many other reviewers have had horrible experiences trying to get the batteries to charge customer service replaced and recharged the battery but to no avail it is sitting and gathering dust do not waste your money,44,5
1497,Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,this is a great little camera that gives quality photos the only dislike i have is that there is a slight delay once you take the picture before it actually takes the shot so sometimes i have to shoot and reshoot to get the shot i want,47,6
1498,Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,my wife and i bought this camera about a year ago right from the get go it had problems we bought it on line so there was no recourse from the dealer if you buy a camera go to an actual store there are real people in case you have a problem kodak customer support is a joke if not down right rude and offers no help the problem withthe camera is that the batteries last for only 3 or 4 shots if you buy the kodak lithium cell 2000 it lasts for about 20 shots if you do a little research you find that the camera requires 33 volts at up to 25 amps no combination of aa cells deliver 33 volts rechargables deliver 12 volts per cell and even lithium cells only deliver 16 volts and anything south of a d cell will not deliver it is rated voltage at 25 amps for very long the long and short of it is that the dx3700 was a defective product from the start and short of fabricating an external battery pack with d cells you better look for another camera,187,7
1499,Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,this camera is great for everyday use the 31 megapixels effective make it a worthwhile buy definitely a graet camera,20,8
1500,Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,i have a different model kodak camera however they all use the same easyshare software running windows xp i could not get the software to work properly after several hours on the phone with kodak tech support they could not get it working either they said they are aware of the problem on some computers running windows xp it is now several months later and they still do not have a fix they do not really seem to care either it might not be a badto consider other brands instead of kodak since if the software will not work properly then what good is the camera,104,9
1501,Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,please do not waste your money on this camera it uses a set of batteries about every 5 - 10 pictures the docking station is a joke as it only works part of the time and has never charged the camera it has been back to kodak but they did not do anything but put in new batteries and send it back the few pictures that it does take are good ones but it is not worth the hassle and please do not depend on this camera to record an important event because i can bet you will be disappointed,95,10
1502,Electronics,B00005OAY3,1.0,negative,not much good to say about this camera complained to customer service with no resolution awkward styling eats batteries cameradosent charge batteries software lacking in features do not buy it,31,11
1503,Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,things started out alright but the led screen burnt out and then the camera stoped transferring pictures to the docking station so far the camera has had more down time then up time,33,12
1504,Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,this is a nice camera for the price 31mp and takes good pictures with some practice be sure you have a lot of light when taking indoor pics although also there is no need at all for the docking station the camera plugs right into any usb port and shows up as a drive on the computer you can then just pull your images off without having to use kodaks software as far as recharging the batteries i picked up some ni-mh batteries and a portable charger and I am good to go I had also recommend getting an additional memory card,101,13
1505,Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,i have upgraded to xp however the software does not work with xp i tried to download new software but i had problems doing so i wrote an email to kodak but they would not send me new software and did not really care seeing that insead of fixing the problem they tried to sell me a newer camera in addition the battery life keeps getting shorter as the camera gets older it is also very diffucult to get a shot of something in action since the camera takes about 2 seconds to autofocus i would reccomend a different for people serious about their photography,104,14
1506,Electronics,B00005OAY3,2.0,negative,this was not my first experience with a digital camera after receiving the kodak 3700 i thought it was defective due to the difficulty in turning it on the main objection was the poor results with the flash in not too bright areas unless very close the picture was very dark just about all pictures had to be adjusted through a photo editing program the delay in the focus and shutter operation left much to be desired the final reason for returning the camera was the incompatibility with the latest mac technology just released when all returns are cleared i am going to opt for a canon 110 or a20 or nikon coolpix family members and friends have these and are very satisfied,123,15
1507,Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,i purchased the dx3700 somewhat out of desperation many models sold out but was intrigued by the high resolution i also purchased athe sd card was sold right alongside the camera and was not a price or availability issue i took the camera on a trip and had 56 high res photos on the 64 mb card with room to spare i thought the camera was a bit bulky and was not thrilled with the battery life but decided to wait until i saw the picture quality when i downloaded the pictures to my laptop i was pleasantly shocked by the beautifuland detail of the photos and the macro close-up shots were excellent pros low price for 31 megapixel camera ease of use quick battery recharging less than 1 hour great picture quality excellent macro shots decent if slow software consmore or less required so-so battery life somewhat bulky,152,16
1508,Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,i am extremely pleased with my purchase of the dx3700 even those it uses the mmc cards i do not care really I am sure a higher mb cards will be coming out soon reading the other reviews i realized how much people are upset about that aspect but you must remember every time something new comes out it is this way they will constantly improve the product and the price will go down right now the highest mb card is the 64 mb which only allows about 75 pictures for a 31 mp camera but hey who needs to take more than that unless you are on vacation and do not have access to a computer which i do not worry about i did not care about the optical zoom which this model does not have the model that did have it was [ amt ] more now with technology constantly changing it is better to be on theand in a few years when I am ready to upgrade i will not feel like I am losing so much money in an expensive piece of equipment this camera only cost me [ amt ],175,17
1509,Electronics,B00005OAY3,4.0,positive,this is my first digital camera i purchased this camera so my wife and i could take picture of our grandson this was a christmas present for both of us i have had trouble finding memory card for this modelbut plan to put it to good use i picked this camera because it is user friendly thanks charles mclendon,59,18
1510,Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,the dx 3700 is very easy to use and works well with windows xp qualtity is best for the money it compares to expensive digitals with qualtity that matches if not exceeds the only negative comment is that a docking station is a must that sales people do not tell you about to keep batteries charged and transfer images to your computer,63,19
1511,Electronics,B00005OAY3,5.0,positive,i have been putting off buying a digital camera for months i was debating on the sony mavica but the pixel quality just was not there 31 pixels for such a low price true it does not have all the bangs and whistles that other digital cameras have but it has the most imortant feature oustanding pictures it does not have an optical zoom but i seldom use that anyway the camerasold separatly is a must a simple push of the button on the docking station and the pictures are in your computer ready for emailing or printing what more could you want for so little money,106,20
1512,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,the sound it produces has low quality i bought this and a panasonic at the same time the sound of the last one is incomparably better i do not recommend maxel headphones at least this one,36,0
1513,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the headphones are comfortable but the volume is low even on the highest level compared to other headphones i have used,21,1
1514,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i know these were cheap but with the brand name i expected a little bit more poor quality for sure not even worth the 3 i paid for them just wanted some back-up headphones I had say they only seem like they would be worth 150 at best can not believe maxell would even put their name on them,56,2
1515,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,they are made of 100 plastic the right side did not work on first use they also feel very delicate in my hands like they are easily broken but for the price hey i might have a different opinion if they worked out of the box,44,3
1516,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,nothing special about these headphones cheaply made with pool audio quality i bought similar items at our local discount store for 5,22,4
1517,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,okay quality for the price i use this for my new hires to watch training videos so not a lot of wear and tear,24,5
1518,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,this headset is horrible i brought it so my kids could use it in school and they said it hurts their ears now they refuse to use it and i have no use for it,36,6
1519,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,fell apart first night my son used them i contacted the maxell people because they have a lifetime warranty but it is a joke because not worth the stamps to send them back,32,7
1520,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,they work well they are kind of tight on my head,11,8
1521,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i wish i could give this a negative 100 stars i got it for a big surgery so i could sleep soundly to my favorite relaxing tunes the 1st night it worked great then the entire right side speaker went out never to be heard from again,47,9
1522,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,all i can say is that they work and that is all you get what you pay for,17,10
1523,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,works well enough for my 9 and 10 year olds now i do not have to hear them argue about who laptop is too loud,24,11
1524,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,needed these for my class great price working great,9,12
1525,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,very good headphones sound is very clear highly recommended,9,13
1526,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,great for small children but the size is a bit tight for someone with a larger head,17,14
1527,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the foam covers on the headphones came off the first day granted they were used by teens but we got other similarly priced headphones which have lasted,27,15
1528,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,i teach 6th grade and bought these for my classroom they are a little small for my students heads but adjust to fit ok works well enough and we managed to afford a full class set,38,16
1529,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,tiny like they were made for a doll very very quiet as well could barely hear anything at full volume did i mention they were tiny,26,17
1530,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,my son used this two times and now it is broken complete waste of money and materials,16,18
1531,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,good quality for the price nothing super fancy but they get the job done,14,19
1532,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,they are still alive after multiple uses got them for school use,12,20
1533,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,awful quality i guess you get what you pay for,10,21
1534,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,it is a good thing these are so inexpensive at the price i can not complain too much but i will not be buying them again,23,22
1535,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i like the thinness and the sound is crisp i like these when i lay on my side in bed and listen to otr,24,23
1536,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,can not be beat for the price respectable brand name and functions as expected not anything to write home about as far as sound quality but they serve their purpose as cheap semi disposable headphones great for people who constantly lose and misplace headphones,43,24
1537,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,very cheap one of ear pieces was already broken off in the sealed package when received,17,25
1538,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,arrived on time i bought these for use at the office to drown out the sounds of my office mate singing along to the radio and to discourage him from engaging me in conversation it does drowned out the singing but some people can not take a hint,47,26
1539,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,ear piece is too tiny not very usable,8,27
1540,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,for the price these obviously will not be the best mega-ultra-bass option for listening to music at high volume but they are great for podcasts and audio books you can fall asleep wearing them comfortably enough which i can not do with earbuds or the giant beats style fashionable headphones that are all you can find these days,54,28
1541,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,lightweight and durable enough to utilize in classroom each day,10,29
1542,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,horrible it did not work at all the box is open so i can not send it back just horrible,17,30
1543,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i bought these to use in the classroom they worked out very well the price is reasonable and serves the purpose,21,31
1544,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,perfect for use at school where headphones are constantly broken or lost so far neither has happened,17,32
1545,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for i need a more expensive pair of headphones,14,33
1546,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,the maxell lighweight stereo headset has for the time i have owned it proven to be the true lightweight good performer that i was looking for others that i have found on the market are cumbersome and provide distorted sound the maxell is the lightest that i have found and provides true clear sound without weighing down the head,59,34
1547,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,we bought two of these one for my mother in law and other for my father in law after hardly a month the fabric from the ear parts started to come off sound started to go dim and then do not remember right or left ear side totally stopped working elderly people were using them with as much care as it was possible even then they hardly worked for such a short time one positive thing about these are that they are very light and do not burden ears,89,35
1548,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,great sound but very small and the so called padding on the head phones are very uncomfortable cheap material and painful on the ears,24,36
1549,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the side strings keep coming off sound quality is good although,11,37
1550,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,very bad reception the sound is like a tin can and breaks up a lot,15,38
1551,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,good sound quality ear sponges a little too thin already breaking through,12,39
1552,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,this headphone set is really small better fitted for a kid,11,40
1553,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,should have purchased a more expensive pair got what i paid for headphones were broken within a week due to the thin plastic at the headband-earphone connection,27,41
1554,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,these head phones are not worth buying they do not work at all and are a waste of money,19,42
1555,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the headphones work ok but when i extend the ear pieces to fit my head the plastic pieces that are part of the extension mechanism end up pressing on the sides of my head it is a design problem stemming for the manufacturers apparent attempt at saving a few pennies on each piece i do not recommend these headphones,59,43
1556,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i was not expecting these to be of super high quality because of the price the problem i had was when i opened them up and realized how narrow the space was to fit around your head as i stretched them apart i thought i was going to break them do not buy these if you are looking to use them for an adult,64,44
1557,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,I have tried numerous headphones for my daughter after a series of purchases that i was not thrilled with i decided to just buy the cheapest pair i could find they are not fancy they do not fit great there has a weird plastic piece near the ear that rubbed against my head when i tried them on but they work they have already lasted longer than most of the other pairs I have bought for her,71,45
1558,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,my son wears hearing aids and prefers these headphones to my panisonic headphones these sound much more tinny or have much more treble than i think most people would prefer for music but the treble amount is easier to her a person speak or figure out lyrics if wearing hearing aids,51,46
1559,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,wanted a lightweight low cost headset and this was exactly what i was looking for,15,47
1560,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,my kids need headphones in a ziplock bag for school ear buds do not work for them these were small enough to fit in the bag and are working well after a few months of use also light and comfortable not too tight on the ears price was decent too do not know why you can not find these in the stores,58,48
1561,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,listening to my oldies on my tablet with hearing aids these work great,13,49
1562,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i bought these through my school for my classroom i bought three pairs my first graders have trouble using them as they are so small 4 days in and one set is broken i guess you get what you pay for,41,50
1563,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,they sound terrible very tinny no bass i suggest for a few dollars more buy the panasonic on-ear stereo headphones rp-ht21 those are decent for les than 10,28,51
1564,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,hurts my ears when i wear it does not fit close to my ears and makes the volume low,18,52
1565,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,perfect for my 2nd grader that needed headphones for school i expected them to break so i purchased 2 pair but they seem to be able to take the torture a 7 year old can give them very satisfied,39,53
1566,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,only one in a pack good for quick use at a low price,13,54
1567,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,cheap but work great for my 6yr that is constantly losing or breaking his headphones,14,55
1568,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,kid needed for school cheap but it is what i was looking for,12,56
1569,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i wanted cheap headphones for a work project and i got what i paid for is that a bad thing no they did a great job and have continued to fit the bill for the last few weeks i have had multiple people use them daily for projects and none of them have given me any problems the sound it great they are very lightweight and have a great range in size they can fit a small head to a quite large one i would recommend this product to anyone that wants a cheap headphone to get the job done,100,57
1570,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,light weight that is the best i can say broke it in less than two weeks ok but delicate take care of it works,23,58
1571,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,fine quality for the price my 8 and 5 year old use them to play on the ipad let us me not listen to minecraft videos which is a blessing worth far more than what i paid kids like them just fine no problems not super sturdy headphones but again for the price they were well worth it,58,59
1572,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,my spare pair which i have not opened yet but which i will when my current simple headphones gives up the ghost,22,60
1573,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i buy these for my kids because they are cheap and expendable they sound cheap they feel cheap they look cheap and they are cheap bump up a whole 3 to the panasonic on-ear rp-ht21 headphones for a significant boost in sound quality build construction and aesthetics,47,61
1574,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i do not like these it feels like they were built for a little kid the sound is good although just not a good fit for an adult head,29,62
1575,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these are way too small for an adult and should be clearly marked as child headphones even my 10 year old daughter complained about the size arrived in an opened and poorly re-sealed package,36,63
1576,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,for a cheap pair of headphones for a kid you can not beat the price,14,64
1577,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,looked used and out of package when arrived,8,65
1578,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,thank you for making this available the price was perfect,10,66
1579,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,bought for working out will not stay on ears and have to turn up volume very loud to use and still hard to hear have had to replace,27,67
1580,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,these headphones are pieces of crap they fell apart within the first month of course it was just after the return period ended the sound is terrible and they are really cheaply made i had purchased another set for almost the same price by jvc and they are 100x better,50,68
1581,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i have bought these headphones 2 times they are too small for the adults in the house but work great for my 4 and 6 year olds the first pair were stepped on and broke so we bought another pair obviously not a product issue but a little kid issue the 2nd pair is still in use when the kids get some vegging time or need time alone it is nice to not hear their games or tv shows esp my daughters favorite you tube videos which can get annoying since it does not fit our heads i do not know how the sound quality is or how loud it can get but my daughter has some audio sensitivities and she will use them so it must not be too bad,131,69
1582,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these headphones were a waste of money the sound quality was very bad always sounded too low them the cord from the right side of the headphones fell out so now it is total garbage these did not even last 6 months i have a pair of panasonic headphones i purchased from amazon in 2013 that are still working very well i expected better from a brand name like maxell i might as well have bought a generic pair from my local drugstore,81,70
1583,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,can not beat them for the price but keep in mind less than 5 many times better than what you would get at dollar store but if you are a stickler audio file might want to try higher quality,37,71
1584,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,cheap and foam on earphones wears out quick,8,72
1585,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,fabulous sound super lightweight i really like them great price too,11,73
1586,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,after using these headphones for a short time i can only hear out of the right ear there are better choices for the cost of these headphones,27,74
1587,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,super fast shipping and arrived exactly as expected,8,75
1588,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i know i should keep my expectations low given the price but these are probably the smallest least comfortable and lowest quality headphones I have ever had spend an extra 2 and get a better pair,35,76
1589,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,very comfortable horrible sound quality i could not return them after tossing the box so they went in the trash,20,77
1590,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i bought these instead of other ones I have purchased for my classroom in the past these when my students pulled the foam off the ears had wires exposed at least the other cheap headphones i had were just exposed plastic speakers when the foam came off i would not recommend these to anyone,53,78
1591,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,foam is really thin and flimsy very uncomfortable for my students,11,79
1592,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i actually ordered 5 pairs for my father he uses headphones every waking moment especially on the weekdays with his news talk shows on the radio so he goes through headphones a lot either they get worn and the speaker goes out in either side or one of our 3 cats get a hold of it and chew it to pieces dad cracked up at the fact that i got him so many because he knows how much he goes through he loves them,84,80
1593,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,i bought these for my three kids tablets you get what you pay for these were the cheapest pair i could find and they are made just that way cheap they serve the purpose but the foam piece on the ears is already coming off right out of the package and when my son put them on i heard a craking sound and it was the slide adjuster piece that needed snapped back into place on each side he has to do that every time he puts them on i guess I am going to adjust them to his 9 year old head and tape them my younger kids have the same problem,112,81
1594,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,cheap enough for a 4 year old when they break your are not out a lot of cash,17,82
1595,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these are worth exactly what we paid they are cheap and will not last long but totally functional,17,83
1596,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,great for the price the kids use them as headphones for the computer as this price no worries if they get broken,23,84
1597,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,if you are looking for inexpensive lightweight headphones these work well i just needed a pair of very lightweight headphones to listen to am talk radio and i did not want to spend a lot so i bought a couple of these so far so good i have other mid to heavy duty headphones when i want to listen to music and want the sound to be higher quality i have been using one of the pairs that i bought daily for the past several months and it is holding up well,92,85
1598,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,the headphones sound fine but came with a wire protruding through one of the ear pads i was able to bend the speaker wire back into the plastic covering and hold it in place with hot glue the price is great since they cost less than some places charge for ear pad replacements,53,86
1599,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,perfect cheap retro headphones for my halloween costume sound is adequate too,12,87
1600,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,i work in a middle school special needs classroom we have 2 autistic boys in the room who spend their daily computer time watching movie clips from various childrens movies and tv shows they usually watch the same clip over and over and over it gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously they were using ear buds when watching their clips but those broke before the holidays after a week of no headphones i decided to order these for them i actually ordered 3 pairs one for each of our classroom computers these are not super high quality headphones but they are working great for our students yes it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice padded over the ear earphones but we do not since these were purchased with my own money this was what was in my budget I am not sure i would order these for myself but for the students they do the job,163,88
1601,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,not too expensive so not such a loss when kids break them at school i bought some others that were almost 10 each and was really upset when they did not last more than a couple of weeks,37,89
1602,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,it is not good buy panasonic volume is lower they are smaller and fragile they fit any size head but they are small and too flimsy pictures make em look bigger,28,90
1603,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,cost ok fits flat on ears with wire to left side one wire a good thing reasonably thick with good male plug wire attachment is weak due to lack of moulded strain relief strain relief is loose tube which is better than nothing perhaps a little glue between the wire and tube would be an improvement sound is not loud and is not as good as my other cheap memorex padding is thin foam which probably helps by providing friction to keep the speakers in place on the ear,89,91
1604,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,the sound is not good and it is too small and tight do not feel comfortable when you put it on,20,92
1605,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,works well for the price do not over-drive them and they will last you a while good price and performance for a cheap headset,22,93
1606,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,great cheap headphones decent sound quality lightweight ear pieces are smaller than some but are good sized,17,94

1608,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,sound was too weak for my hearing impaired mom,9,96
1609,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,was a gift for a friend who said they liked it,11,97
1610,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,they were flimsy like the dollar store ones i was disappointed i could have purchased better ones for the money,20,98
1611,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,these are great i got these for my better half he likes them very much he did not want ear buds so these are great,24,99
1612,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,you get what you pay for with these no bass and flimsy but for only 5,16,100
1613,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,cheap small not comfortable would not recommend spend more and purchase higher grade headphones,14,101
1614,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,they fit but the sound quality is not great,8,102
1615,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,product worked as advertised and am pleased with results,9,103

1617,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,these will be used in the car for grandsons portable childrens dvds lightweight and work well,16,105
1618,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i have already written a review for these little headphones they are small and you get what you pay for i love them because they fit my pea sized head they are also cheap enough that if i sit on them or they do break i can replace them without tears the sound is not incredible but definitely okay i use these more than the more expensive pairs i have bought they are small enough to fit a child and if you are hard on your headphones these are a great little extra pair to have around i really enjoy mine,101,106
1619,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,these headphones were defective when they arrived only one side was working and the volume on the other was very low amazon replaced them but the replacement had the same problem,31,107
1620,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,these do not fit tight enough to really hear the music,11,108
1621,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,i know i did not spend much on these headphones but they are incredibly flimsy bend easily and do not stay on,20,109
1622,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,love these yes head phones wear out and break but these last pretty well and are light weight,18,110
1623,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,these are in the goldilocks zone just right-just right-just right they are just the right price to feed to my 8 and 11 year old both of whom have breakable tendencies six of these lasted 9 months an absolute bargain compared to the more expensive sets i was buying based on an assumption of robustness these are just right so that they can be hauled around dropped kicked jammed in the bottom of a backpack and they just spring back it takes quite a lot to do them in and in the meantime blessed silence since each child is welcome to plug their headphones into their tablet so that the rest of the house does not have to listen to game-play or inane music for hours on end a lifesaver on a plane roadtrip and more for ears too small to accept earbuds these are the perfect compromise the sound is tolerable for games or light music listening not a lot of dynamic range for this price point but that is not what I am praising them for,173,111
1624,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,my son got this for christmas and loves it it is very lightweight good buy,15,112
1625,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,great head set for the price I am not suggesting that they are pro level sound but work great and have good sound quality i also like the single cable as they stay out of the way more you can not beat it for the price and if you have prime you are almost getting them for next to nothing thanks amazon,60,113
1626,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,great product buying process was smooth and easy shipping was fast a pleasure to do business with i would recommend this company to everyone,24,114
1627,Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,good value for an inexpensive set of headphones,8,115
1628,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,i like these headphones lightweight i am ordering another pair and the price is reasonable,15,116
1629,Electronics,B00006JPRN,2.0,negative,cheap cr p you get what you pay for the chord is short the sound quality is atrocious the snap that holds the moveable part broke in a month,28,117
1630,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,these were great headphones i am on the phone most of the day and these headphones are so comfortable i can hear the customers crystal clear,26,118
1631,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,these headphones were great for the money i use them to run of course the sound quality is not great look at the price i broke them the other day and was not even angry because at this price i can just get another,42,119
1632,Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,good sound fit nicely kids all loved them better for your ear s then the ear buds for sound and for comfort,22,120
1633,Electronics,B00006JPRN,1.0,negative,big disappointment with maxell they should sell these at the dollar store this is one of those products where you wonder why did they even bother,26,121
1672,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,I am using the v400 on my g5 desktop comp at work and i love it it tracks well is a perfect size and feel and is lightweight i also love the horizontal scrolling highly recommended,35,0
1673,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,works great with vista really good cursor focus works good on textured surfaces,13,1
1674,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,this product have a very good grip and handle the size it is correct and they function bottoms are good the usb connection work propertly,24,2
1675,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,i had this mouse for half a year i suffered from this mouse a lot first of all the battery will not last for a week if you keep mouse awake i am using rechargeble battery sanyo ni-mh 2100 mah i also have a microsoft mouse even although it uses two battery instead of one as v400 the battery can support me for half a year second the focus of v400 is not good sometimes you can see the cursor is shaking without any movement these days i found a new big problem the mouse is frozen when windows xy starts up i thought it was xps problem eventually i figured out it was my v400 mouse i had a very good impression with logitech but this time i will double think when i buy anything from logitech,138,3
1676,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,what can i say i bought this mouse from amazon under the new and used category it came in the mail i opened it put a aa battery in plugged it into my macbook pro and it worked right away the product did not come with mac drivers but they were easy to find on the logitech website i installed them restarted set up the two extra buttons the way i wanted used expose functions so it is pretty much like a 30 dollar mighty mouse the only thing that I have have problems with is that the side-scrolling can not be adjusted and it is really really slow I have gotten good and just clicking it over to make it go faster but otherwise the tracking is amazing the scroll wheel is really nice the buttons are great it is perfect size very portable good mouse,141,4
1677,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,i did not experience tracking and long wake up time problem as other user has reviewed i tried some different types of mouse pad and i think it is doing fine however i think this mouse is too small I am used to use large mouse when i use it i feel more tired than use large mouse and I am not used to the back / forward button position,64,5
1678,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,logitech so far always appeared to me as being a first tier supplier of quality mice i am shocked how logitech could dare to release such a product they are actually back to the good old days where users would need a mouse pad in order to get proper performance the v400 does not work well on dark surfaces it does not work well on light surfaces and it does not work well on tablecloth i have actually bought the v400 because i did not like the scroll panel of the v500 to my surprise the v500 with conventional red led works well on all mentioned surfaces where v400 is a nightmare it is a darned cheek when logitech claims to have introduced the v400 all terrain laser tracking technology,131,6
1679,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,like most other users here the tracking problems I have encountered have been aweful light or dark mousepad or not two different pcs latest setpoint driver software it does not seem to matter also by comparison i have the mx500 corded optical mx700 cordless optical and mx1000 latest cordless laser on various machines and all work perfectly on the same mousepads and surfaces upon which the v400 fails the mx1000 works perfectly on the same laptop with the same setpoint driver software on which the v400 fails bottom line it is definitely the the v400 the v400 mouse will work fine for a while then if you stop to type something like the paragraph above then go back to the mouse and move it the cursor just stays put you have to move the mouse around quite a bit to get it to recognize that it is being moved clicking the mouse seems to wake it up immediately but of course that may not be appropriate depending on the application you are in as far as I am concerned i have loved everything logitech that I have ever owned until now in my opinion the v400 is a piece of junk,195,7
1680,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,i just purchased this mouse and have used it for 3 days now it works well as a mouse but it is very uncomfortable in my hand having to use your index finger for the forward and back buttons is awkward it also does not fit your hand well i would not recommend this unit i am returning the v400 i originally had a microsoft notebook mouse which works well and was comfortable to use but i was specifically looking for a notebook mouse with forward and back buttons the v400 seemed a gooduntil actually using it I had love a smaller version of the mx1000 note the logitech software that comes in the package is an older vesrsion that does not allow the forward and back buttons to work with the mozilla firefox browser you have to download a 47 mb update from the logitech support site,147,8
1681,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,this is the only 5 button notebook-sized wireless mouse i can find and so i gave it a shot besides the fact that it does not work on a glass table this mouse delivers the tracking is in fact very good on most reasonable surfaces money well spent,48,9
1682,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,I have had the v400 for about a week now and I am generally pretty happy with it the ergonomic design fits my hand well and the rubber grips make it easy to hold the addition of the back / forward buttons is nice although their placement means that you need to use your index finger to use them another minor complaint is that they are not two separate buttons rather the two buttons are part of a single rocker that tilts back and forth making it slightly more cumbersome to use that said I am happy they are there at all as most notebook / travel mice I have looked at do not have these additional buttons aesthetics are subjective naturally but i prefer it is clean simple lines to microsofts blobby I shall-defined but otherwise comfortable notebook mice regarding tracking I have noticed that the v400 is stymied by darker surfaces and textures dark wood and granite are two surfaces where it seems to get easily confused however on lighter surfaces the majority of the surfaces i use tracking is flawless i docked a star from the review because of this caveat not really the all-terrain performance as promised on the package,192,10
1683,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,hi all i have both the v400 and the microsoft 6000 the v400 has many problems seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go the tracking is awfull constantly stopping and restarting the precision also is too bad is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse more if you try with cad applications any person even the basic pc user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism is true is a nice looking mouse i have many logitech products that are really good from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one this v400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had kinda disappointing I am uploading pictures of my mouse logitech v400 orange so if you want to have a mouse to look and show the v400 could be a museum object but if you want a extreme machine the microsoft 6000 is the one to go greetings sergio claver from lima peru,165,11
1684,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,i tried using this mouse for several days thinking that i would get used to it i bought it because i liked the usb that snaps in i tend to lose things easily the extra buttons are a great feature i also thought the laser would give me better accuracy well I am not a fan the accuracy is not good compared to my cheapo logitech optical mouse the tracking is awful plus it is not very ergonomical my wrist started hurting after only 30 minutes i returned it,88,12
1685,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,i do not use mice everyday instead preferring to use a drawing tablet mainly i use this mouse when with my laptop i am probably not a picky about mice as the other reviewers that said i have not had any real problems with this mouse it has worked great for day-to-day tasks and the extra buttons make it little nicer to navigate on the internet on the downside it is not a sensitive as i would like for detailed tasks like drawing and photo editing i do not think i would want this as my only mouse / input deviece considering the amount of graphic design work i do but it is great for word processing spreadsheets and web browsing for everything else I shall stick with the tablet on my desktop,126,13
1686,Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,i have the same problem others reviewers write down here before me a pitty i did not listen them before the accuracy is terrible awfull many times i move the mouse and the pointer star to move erraticaly or does not move at all no precision and do just the contrary that the add says all terrain i have many friends that have the microsoft mouse for notebook and they no have problems where i have the relatively good news is that with time if you play a little with the setup you reach an acceptable beahvior but nothing compared to a normal old logitech mouse eduardo,106,14
1687,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,warning do not buy these radios i have alot of experience with two way radios i live and work in the mountains of montana and i know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios I have had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers anyway i feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking it is slight but very noticable with regular use i feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can not be certain in addition the sound of the audio is horrible i was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply is not worth it the sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe motorola should recall this product it a serious dissapointment from a company who has name typically means quality these may be the worst radios i have ever owned sorry folks this pair of radios are not worth the box they are shipped in,194,0
1688,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,the product worked but only about 500 yards this may be due to trees and more i suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation,27,1
1689,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,the ordering and shipping on this product was super fast i received it a few days after ordering like the product plan on using it for outdoor activities would recommend this product and it is cheaper than i saw advertised anywhere else,42,2
1690,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios it was frequently very difficult / impossible to understand what the other person was saying confirmed in both directions this was not an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such simply it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded i have an fcc license and have owned numerous motorola radios over the years this set was a real disappointment a radio that can ideally communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can not understand what the other person is saying even from a very short distance away furthermore the housing of these radios lacks durability the rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone just cheap-feeling plastic now,128,3
1691,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,the motorola 9500 was strongly recommended however the set that i received turned out to be a piece of junk very poor voice clarity and quality we depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor to the point of just not using them which put us in a very unsafe position at times i did call motorola and was informed that i was past the warranty time and they would do nothing my recommendation is to buy a set of midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators,108,4
1692,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,this is the first pair of two-way radios i have used they work very well voice is clear i tested the range of these units by driving away from the other user we kept talking until the signal began to break up which was about 7 miles your mileage may vary this was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees these units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation,74,5
1693,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,used the motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip great communications with day long battery life and swapping in aa batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions great radios a good buy at a great price,42,6
1694,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,product is extremely easy to use used while on vacation in the islands on a cruise it is an ideal method for communiction when you are with large parties clarity is not bad but not great worked better in open areas,40,7
1695,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,this radio has adequate power and the audio to get out i highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors rather than weak 5 watt frs radios i found them larger than many in this class and a bit under powered at only 2 watts maximum but ok however it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the remanufactured sale list quite often i suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on or it could be something else if lots get returned and resold it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process in any case buy with caution,118,8
1696,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,despacho eficiente y en los tiempos de entrega considerados en cuanto al producto es un buen juguete para los nios tiene sus limitaciones en alcance,25,9
1697,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,pros used with other motorolla and non motorolla radios and the sound quality was good battery holds charge for several days in normal use cons 25 mile range is bizarre because the most that i got was about a mile and a half,43,10
1698,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,it is a great product especially for the price amazon offers it for stores sell the same two way radio for the same price but does not have the 25 mile capability it was a great deal,37,11
1699,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,i have not tested these for their full 25 mile range but they seem to work well enough around the office complex and at the park the 2 mile range for urban areas that other reviewers have stated seems to be about right i might have actually gotten more than two miles but i also live in los angeles where we do not have very many tall buildings overall they work well enough for casual use but i would not consider them for more critical applications,83,12
1700,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,i have not had much chance to use it as i purchased it for use as an emergency preparedness block captain in my city we have practiced using it but i will not really know until a disaster of some type happens i am pleased to have it for that purpose,51,13
1701,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,despite the problems some other reviewers have reported i have not seen them myself the radios could be more durable but for the money they seem like a good value some friends of mine recently took them beach camping and said they had no trouble with the signal although the users were never more than a few miles away from each other the kids liked the interchangeable covers,67,14
1702,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,the motorola t9500xlr seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment once out of the packaging the 2 units are charged via a cradle i have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well first off keep in mind these are not professional level radios they are merely entry level units for home and family use they are ideal for road caravans amusement parks shopping malls cruise ships and more as other reviewers have mentioned the voice over the speaker is tinny and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible the range is definitely nowhere near the claimed 25 miles in a typical setting you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country just remember these radios cost around 50 for the pair and you simply can not expect professional quality at this price point the noaa radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle overall i wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature,182,15
1703,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,this is my second pair of two-way radios the first set picked up quite a bit of extraneous noise wind staticbut this pair worked much better and was clearer we used them for two days my son and i to try them out at the beach at home and at a big park once we found the right channels they worked perfectly all places i did try to test the distances difficult while walking but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine there was a bit a static at the beach but not too much they are not as clear as your cell phone but if you are out and about at a amusement park or park with your child they will work fine,129,16
1704,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,although the radios had some good features the bad sound quality trumped all of them i had to frequently ask for repeats because the sound was so bad even at close range i do not know whether it is really cheap speakers or bad processing but it sounds like you are talking down a long length of plastic tubing there are other radios for under 10000 that work much much better i just returned the t9500xlrs,75,17
1705,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,these radios have worked well for what i use them for and they keep there charge not more buying batteries they work well,23,18
1706,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,got these so that we can tell our 9yo to come home works with other brands too uniden for sure so he can also communicate with his friends who have other brands while they are playing,35,19
1707,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,for all of the features and capability they put into these radios motorola forgot one key element sound quality other reviews that mention can not understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away are not referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers with only a passing knowledge of audio electronics it would seem that motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker as the sound is very clipped sounding and horribly distorted they could also use a modest compressor on the input as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker for a radio that is marketed as a family product they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk after 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it i still could not get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out these are getting returned unfortunately as they seem to have all the features i want we will try again with midland i think,183,20
1708,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,i love these walkie talkies the sound quality is great and they feel good in your hand i have not had a chance to try them camping but am anxious to do so please note that 25 mile range is optimal when you are in a non populated area with no trees,51,21
1709,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,motorola has done it again these radios work excellent and i would not buy anything else,15,22
1710,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,do not buy the motorola handled radios without this or the ear phone based product if you plan to use the radio in a noisy environment particularly if they are required to wear hearing protection even with the vibrate alarm our employees were often missing talk requests with the clip on speaker and microphone the sound is placed closer to the ears and is heard much easier the radio also need not be removed from the worn position to talk back,80,23
1711,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,the original units would not work right i called morotola and they said those were the deffective ones they sent me new ones that work just fine i sent the old ones back so they could experiment on them motorola provided post paid return envelope a good final experience it pays to go with a name brand that has service department and cares about their customers,64,24
1712,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,this is the second pair of radios i buy so that each member of my family has one products works very well and is very useful for our family vacations both at the beach and at the mountains,38,25
1713,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,wow what junk these worked fine for about two weeks then worked intermittently and are now dead now comes the hassle of sending them back to motorola and probably paying more to have them fixed than buying new ones these never should have made it off the drawing board,49,26
1714,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,after owning 2-way frs / gmrs radios by bellsouth cobra and motorola motorola radios were always the highest quality they may not have been the best in every area but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked the last 3 models I have owned have all been motorola i purchased the t9500xlr their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio the other day to replace my t4900s i was appalled at them the sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older cheaper t4900s and worse yet the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually at any range and at any transmit power whether in the next room or half a mile away the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out no settings affected this i ordered a pair of midland gxt710vp3 radios instead they are way better they are what the t9500xlrs should be,147,27
1715,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i purchased these to replace my aging t7200s but there is no comparison the 7200s are far better the 9500xlr have very poor sound quality very tinny like talking in a can the volume does not go high enough and the reception is poor i spent a few days using these two models side-by-side and the weaknesses in these radios jump out immediately i am happy to say that amazon accepted my return do not make the same mistake i did look for a different model,84,28
1716,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,this has been very useful not just for fun but at remote locations of work related business i would suggest easier menu layout the ability to silence ptt confirmation better clip design recommended overall best buy considering what is out there,41,29
1717,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,do not like thisdo well to get 2 mile range can not understand what other person says 1/2 mile away,20,30
1718,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,we bought these for christmas and they were hours of fun the entire week afterwards the boys especially love to use them for air-soft wars because you can wear earphones with them and turn them on vibrate the only complaint we have is that they do not seem to work long-range we had them on vacation took one for a drive in the car and left another at home we lost contact in about 1/2 mile i will say that we did not play around with that feature too much so maybe there is something we could have done to get a longer signal do not know but they are great fun for around the neighborhood,116,31
1719,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,the audio quality is really poor compared to other manufacturers you can not understand other users even over quite short distances and this not helped when the signal keeps dropping in and out whatever you do do not be beguiled by the motorola name and do not expect any support from motorola regarding this problem they will not do anything about these poor quality products i complained to the uk and united states offices of motorola and both fobbed me off i have some really cheap uniden radios which have a superb sound compared to these you can expect better quality from two tin cans and a length of string than motorolas t9500xlr radios,116,32
1720,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,i got these radios because i own two talkabout t5950s i figured that i would upgrade to a newer better model was i wrong they do transmit farther than my prevous model but you can not understand what is being said i am a loyal motorola fan but they had betterup the qaulity i will be returning these radios and i will go back to the old stand-by for another year,72,33
1721,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,this was a real bad decision when people say it all in the name they do not mean motorola t9500r,19,34
1722,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,great price and loaded with man features hard to imagine not going with motorola,14,35
1723,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,these radios are the worst you can not hear anything it does not matter if you are 5 feet away from the other person or 100 feet they look nice but that about covers it i have nowhy they are still being sold and have not had a recall on the up side i called motorola and they are aware of the problem they are sending me new ones and a different better model they are also sending me return postage so i can send them these awful things back i will let you know how the new ones are,101,36
1724,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,purchased two twin packs of the t9500r radio and the sound quality is so poor they are absolutely useless for transmitting i can hear other radios well enough but any transmit attempts are not understood by other radios do not purchase,40,37
1725,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,i bought these because the mini club i drive with use 2-way radios for communication the came with headsets and either with or without them it was almost impossible to hear what people were saying range was poor too save your money and buy something cheaper these just do not live up to their claims,54,38
1726,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,they work well are a relative bargain and are nice and small the preferred radio for mt biking,18,39
1727,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations until now I have been very happy with many different motorola and midland models the t9500 has great features but the sound quality is lousy which makes it virtually unusable,40,40
1728,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,we use 6 8 handheld radios at our business to communicate across multiple floors and buildings we have gone through two generations of motorola talkabouts with this line being the third these are the worst of them all the last generation of blue and black ones was fairly bad with several ceasing to work within days of purchase and so we thought we would upgrade to the next model up of the 6 we purchased 5 did not have adequate sound transmission cutting off at the beginning and end of transmission or not working at all these are junk do not waste your money my one star is because they are attractive to look at,116,41
1729,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,i purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them the voice clarity does not exist no one is able to understand anyone it cuts out sporadically i would say that the distance is terrible also but i can not tell if the radio is cutting out or i just can not understand anyone called moto and they actually confirm that there is a problem with this and another new model they recommended that i get the sx800r model at first they would not even take it back oh the noaa channels are great and clear design is also good,103,42
1730,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5.0,positive,wow have walkie-talkies changed in four years these are packed with some pretty sophisticated features including noaa weather alert and are very user-friendly strongly recommend,25,43
1731,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,as many people have noted the audio quality of these radios is terrible i also had an issue with the radios cutting out on me and times when i had to turn the radios off and on just to get them to communicate again,44,44
1747,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2.0,negative,i order these often and they are usually fine but today when they arrived i could not help but notice the bag barely weighed anything compared to my other bag of 2 lb of grapes it looks so empty weighed them on the scale and it was just under 1 lb where is the other pound,52,0

1750,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1.0,negative,the quality of produce has gone wayyyyy down since i started using amazon fresh and these sad excuse for grapes are a prime example of it they are almost bare branches and some are rotting most edible grapes are visibly yellow amazon fresh is not worth it anymore to me identification rather brave the masses at the grocery store than get the kind of produce they send,67,3

1775,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1.0,negative,the grapes upon delivery were mostly brownish mushy and some of them tasted disgusting,13,28
1776,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5.0,positive,so far all the produce I have purchased has been fresh,10,29
1777,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2.0,negative,amazon fresh is usually pretty great with fresh fruits and produce but this bunch was bad i had to throw it,22,30
1778,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1.0,negative,whoever packed my order at this location thought it would be a swellto drop two heavy icepacks on top of the grapes yeah not so much last time it was four cans of progresso soup on top of a tube of quaker oats which had been packed on it is side at the bottom of the tote that was fun to clean up wasting food is not myof a good time get it together springfield,78,31
1779,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1.0,negative,arrived browning two days later even with refrigeration they were inedible,11,32
1780,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5.0,positive,these were good and lasted a long time,8,33
1781,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1.0,negative,using amazon fresh was a pleasant experience for me with the exception being these grapes one night in the fridge and half the bunch turned brown,26,34
1782,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2.0,negative,tough skin and has seeds not what i was expecting,10,35

1787,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2.0,negative,i bought 2 bunches both were browning with chewy bitter skin i will not order them again,16,40
1788,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,4.0,positive,this was my first amazon fresh order so i did not know what to expect in terms of the fresh produce the grapes i got are about the same as what we have in local grocery stores at this time of year smaller a little tart crisp thepacks in the delivery totebag kept all my produce cold I shall probably still shop at my local markets for seasonal produce but this was a convenient option and the quality of the goods was fine,83,41
1789,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5.0,positive,fresher than the bunches in stores stayed fresh for 2 weeks,11,42
1790,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,2.0,negative,you could tell the grapes were old half of them had mold on them,14,43
1791,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1.0,negative,my kids and husband love mio but it is so expensive that i was hoping that this vitamin squeeze energy drink would be a better alternative it is not from the moment they all took a sip i could see that it was going to go into the garbage pretty quickly all of them said it tasted kinda like kool-aid but then they all grimaced and got went for the water they all said it had a weird aftertaste the 8 year old said her mouth tasted funny and that they did not want any more of it or to finish the glass they had so yeah mio this is definitely not,109,0
1792,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5.0,positive,this is the easiest way to add nutrients to my bottled water and to help me get the daily intake of water that i need I am not good about drinking plain water each day and this little squeeze has really helped me to drink what i should great taste great product,51,1
1793,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5.0,positive,I have have tried the citrust acai grape pomegranate and the fruit punch they all have great tastes if you are looking for a drink that does not taste overly sweet than this is it a quick squirt in a glass of water was perfect it reminded me of a blend of propel and a vitamin water I am not a big fan of sweet sports drinks and often water down my gatorade or powerade because it is too sweet this is a perfect option for someone looking for a great tasting drink with good flavor that is not too sweet,98,2
1794,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5.0,positive,great new product i have tried 3 of the 4 flavors tropical citrus acai grape pomegranate and energy peach green tea i work in a high school and i am always getting sick i have been drinking vitamin squeeze for several months now and have not been sick once this is the only thing i have done differently i do not like the taste of the tap water at the school so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water finally a truly great drink which is much better than mio and half the price of vitaminwater all it takes is a little squeeze for me vitamin squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products 0 calorie 0 carbs 0 sugar love it my teens think the tropical citrus tastes like tang or a creamsicle i am headed back to safeway to get more i highly recommend this product,164,3
1795,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5.0,positive,ever since i saw mio i thought it was a cutebut why do i really need flavor i prefer function and vitaminsqueeze fruit punch is my familys favorite and get the flavor for free great taste my kids definitely prefer a small glass of fruit punch in the morning over a gummy vitamin anyway great new product i recommend,61,4
1796,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4.0,positive,p product tasted great and i initially thought the bottle was great squirt a few and you are good however i left it standing as you see in the pic and came back with product leaking / leaked out so that was not good i like the taste and am in the camp that no matter how healthy we eat we need to supplement with vitamins / minerals be it in pill powder or liquid form your choice,72,5
1797,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2.0,negative,this stuff makes your water taste somewhat like koolaid but i would not consider giving it to kids we need to eat and drink more natural foods not stuff like this,30,6
1798,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2.0,negative,this taste like kool-aid with a hint of cough syrup i hate cough syrup and the kids here did not like the taste either it also contains caffeine so you can not give this stuff to kids all day thinking that the vitamins will be good for them too much caffeine makes kids go hyper active if you dilute it a lot it does not take like anything except for a kool-aide / cough syrup after taste the bottle is pretty large although and will last for weeks if you enjoy the taste,88,7
1799,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1.0,negative,the taste is so gross that i can not even finish it i would not waste my money on this i would rather have an energy drink and take a multi-vitamin everyday if i needed caffeine,34,8
1800,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4.0,positive,i can not say how much energy this drink supplement will give you but i do enjoy the taste it tastes like hawaiian punch did to me as a kid but without the sugar you just squeeze some into some water and you have a healthy drink without the carbonation or sugar of soft drinks i like it it is a nice break from lemonadetea and other such drinks and it makes water taste good,75,9
1801,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4.0,positive,the flavor of this product is good a bit too sweet but that is par for the course with these sort of things it is satisfying to know that my daily afternoon drink is providing all the vitamins i need for the day it is not as concentrated as some of the other flavored drink mixes on the market which means the bottle is really big it may sound like an unimportant thing but it is harder to toss it in your purse when the bottle is so large but that is my only real complaint otherwise this product is pretty good,99,10
1802,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4.0,positive,i am used to the powdered packets that crystal light offers and i think i could go either way the nice thing about this is that you can add as much as you like until the taste is as strong as you want it to be i have no clue if the vitamins are doing any good but as far as the taste goes it is not bad,67,11
1803,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1.0,negative,i thought this might be a good way to get the best of both worlds water plus vitamins however the taste was so awful i could not do it it tasted like bad kool-aid i tried it four times just to see if i could get past the taste for the benefits but it was a no-go and on the fourth try i squeezed the vitamin mix into my water and the vitamin bottle started leaking all over my hand and the counter i did not get it all wiped up and it dried super sticky makes me wonder just how much sugar was in it i think I shall go back to the old fashioned way of taking vitamins,117,12
1804,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5.0,positive,this is a good sized bottle and it lasts a long time dollar for dollar and taste for taste i would rate this over mio any day it had a better flavor and no snails-in-the-mouth feeling it is very easy to mix just take a sip out of your water bottle to make some shaking room squeeze in less than you think you will need shake and taste the flavor on this builds up very quickly so start off light unlike mio it does not go from zero-to-nasty in a hurry so you have some room teens liked this better than adults of course i did not tell them it was a vitamin drink,111,13
1805,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1.0,negative,we all tried it 2 parents 13 year old and 10 year old nobody liked it older child said that it tasted like chewable vitamins adults did not think it was that bad but did not like it either net result is that after everyone tried it once it sat untouched on the shelf in the pantry for months nobody wanted a second glass it can not deliver the vitamins if nobody drinks it,71,14
1806,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2.0,negative,this adds vitamin c and caffeine to your water which is great for people who are looking for that caffeine may boost your workouts and is the daily drug of choice for many of us but watch out for side effects and do not over do it the deal breaker for me on this one was taste it tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch kool-aid with a pronounced aftertaste i strongly prefer optimum nutrition essential amino energy fruit fusion a powdered caffeine add-on or some of the mio products,91,15
1807,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2.0,negative,1 I am definitely a fan of the powdered drinks and recently noticed the craze surrounding the concetrated liquid formula bottomline the taste is fine and i can see the benefit of being able to fine tune the taste for varying sizes of cups h20 but in the end i was put off by the fact that you have to keep this stuff in the fridge and depending on how you squeeze it it is inevitable that you are going to make a mess here or there i think it is much more versatile to utilize the powdered form at least for me,100,16
1808,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,not that great of a set because it is overpriced for one and there has almost no down in the comforter you are better off going to walmart or some place like that and buying one very disappointed,35,0
1809,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i bought this comforter set in hopes it would fit in my washer it is the first king size comforter i have found that i can launder at home i wash it on delicate and dry on low heat it has held up very well to weekly washings so far all stains from baby formula to ink have washed out i am pleased thus far and considering buying sets for the kids,72,1
1810,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,great quality comforter set only purchase for light summer use not ment for heavy winter use,16,2
1811,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,it was soft and great right out of the bag however the 1st time we washed it feathers were everywhere by the time we washed it the 2nd time it was not more than just a piece of material and had to throw it away the tag said machine wash this one must have had a flaw in the material or was just cheaper made i bought one just like it 6 years ago and it looks as good as the day i bought it after multiple machine washings i was very disappointed in this product,95,3
1812,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,what a remarkable value for the low price i was not sure what to expect but it is a lovely set at twice the price all pieces are well-fitting comforter is warm yet lightweight and an added bonus it is even reversible now i regret not getting a couple of other colors as well because they are all out of stock in cal king now,61,4
1813,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,so i read the reviews but recongize that some people have unreasonable expectations you get what you pay for but this set is amazing and for the money fantastic i saw that people compained that the feathers came out i have never seen a one it is very warm yet is not too warm when your heat is up i have slept with the windows open and that soft cozy feeling is amazing i bought the khakiis very soft and feels like a super high quality set it comes with pillow shams and skirt you will just love it and do not be scared of the other posts,107,5
1814,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,love theand how it keep you warm but a problom with the feathers comeing out the faethers is over every thing,24,6
1815,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,this comforter set is okay if you do not mine wearing feathers all day long or seeing them all over your bed and room I have on had the comforter for about 3 weeks and feathers are everywhere even getting all over our clothes my husband is sick of it and just said yesterday that he has planning to take it to the salvation army and just buy a comforter from walmart the style and look is nice but the feathers coming through the fabric is insane,84,7
1816,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i was excited to receive this set because i love there d and really wanted to try a down comforter i slept great the first night and i loved the microsuede fabric i did not like however how each time i touched it the feathers would come flying out each time i fluff it to make my bed there are feathers everywhere i hate that it is perfect as long as i do not sleep on it,76,8
1817,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised with this purchase the quality far surpasses what i expected it is warm comfortable and only a few feathers seep out when i make the bed,29,9
1818,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,what a dissapointing purchase the material is very thin the feathers are coming out everywhere and it does not provide any warmth i have a down comforter that is over 10 years old and it is much better than this new one now i just use both of them on the bed i should have returned it but did not,58,10
1819,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i have this on my bed right now it is warm soft and light enough we do not roast to death but heavy enough to keep us warm it is really easy to clean we have taken it to the laundro-mat and washed it in the huge washer using the huge dryer adn tennis balls to make sure the stuffign was dry i would buy another for our daughters room but she has not decided on her colors yet,75,11
1820,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this comforter to anyone from the time i took it out of the bag it came in feather have been everywhere it only gets worse as time goes on it is comfortable and warm and it would look good if not for the white feather all over the place,53,12
1821,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,this comforter set arrived to me in a huge box i was like oh yeah until i opened it there was more paper in the box than comforter the comforter bag was so small like it was a sheet set i can not believe that there is no down in the dame thing i wonder why they only want 3500 for it because your getting a sheet set with 1 feather in it and called it adown comforter i read other reviews and they said that feathers are everywhere but i do not see how that is possible if it did not come with any feathers unless they some how lost the feathers during shipment laughing out loud or mywas bald go figure,123,13
1822,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,it had very little to no down it looks like there is some filler it the photo but when i received it the comforter had no fill somehow it got passed quality control with no down in it,38,14
1823,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,i purchased thisand sent it back after opening it the seams were coming apart and it was really thin i did not expect anything great but this was a lot less than i expected,35,15
1824,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i love theand texture of this comforter however as mentioned in previous reviews it does not take long before the feathers start to come out i thought for the price i would try it and hope for the best unfortunately my comforter did the same as others and with it being a dark brown it is very noticeable that the feathers are coming out this is not just an occasional feather either it started out that way but after a week or two it is all the time i especially notice it in the stitching areas disappointed,98,16
1825,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i love my new comforter it is deliciously soft and comfortable be warned it is much too heavy for year-round use but perfect for a freezing winter night theis oh-so-slightly less vivid than in the picture but it is still a beautiful addition to my bedroom i would definitely order this product again,55,17
1826,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,the microsuede is incredibly soft the pillow covers are great but i have feathers everywhere they come out very easily and make a mess of the entire place,28,18

1828,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,it is well worth the 35 bucks it is not too thick which means you can actually sleep with it and not sweat to death,23,20
1829,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,for the 3500 i paid for this set it was well worth the money it is so warm so cozy so soft yet it looks very high-class it is not as poofy as the pictures make it look even after giving it a big fluff-up but it really does add a touch-of-class to our room and i wish i would have gotten the red set too for our other room the only problem that I have had is that the feathers / down come out a lot not really at the seams so much just at random places all over the comforter it is a little annoying always vacuuming them up but other than that it is been great,113,21
1830,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,the comforter is soft and pretty however it is not very full and fluffy the worst of it is that the down feathers fall out of the comforters thin material and make a mess in the bed we are not able to use this comforter at all,46,22
1831,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,no problem with the shams or bed skirt and i loved thebut the feathers in the comforter started coming out very quickly it really looks like i plucked a chicken on my bed i was less than pleased with the set but for the price i guess i got what i paid for,55,23
1832,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,great deal for the price the stitching is very weak and has only one stitch accross each pattern if it breaks and there were breaks then it breaks loose it is not 100 down it says 75 on mine yet the ad says 100 eachhas a different feel to it and it is noticeable having said all of that i gave it a 4 because for the price you are getting something worth what you pay for it is warm and maintains the warmth not like the true 100 down comforters although,93,24
1833,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,light soft warm good quality overall and i got it with extremely affordable price everyone loves it in the family,20,25

1835,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,pros comforter is warm and you get a good night sleep cons you may get a good nite sleep but when you wake up you will find feathers allover the bed the feathers keep coming out from comforter cover i used this for a week and have thrown this i do not want the hassle of removing feathers from my bed every day can i get a refund on this,72,27
1836,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,comforter slides off the bed not a bad thing since the feathers stab you in your sleep did i mention 100s of feathers come through the comforter and get everywhere got a deal but never expected this amazingly bad quality,40,28
1837,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i have been pleased with my purchase of this comforter set it was not as puffy as i was expecting but it definately keeps us warm my only complaint is that it does she had feathers which show up against the darkthat we ordered,44,29

1841,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i was extremely pleased with this comforter set it is very very warm even although it is not a thick comforter lightweight and warm that is a plus i have a cat that loves to lay on it and it has been the easiest to clean the hair off of that i have owned with a lint brush which makes the entire comforter look very nice love it,66,33
1842,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,ordered this set in navy loved the look until i opened it white feathers inside the comforter would poke through the exterior top of blanket with debris it looked amess and very unattractive bought a lint brush to attempt to wipe off the feathers but that did not do anything i removed the comforter set from the bed within two weeks of having it i do not recommend thisat all maybe the lighter colors would work better but i am not willing to find out,86,34
1843,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,several years ago i purchased a comforter and shams as a gift it was three times the price of the one i just bought from amazon yet identical in every way with the exception that the amazon purchase also came with a bedskirt it is lightweight but warm has a good loft while still being flexible the filling is actually down and not the pin feathers that tend to crackle and end up poking through the fabric other reviews I have read on this product reflect disappointment that the shams are thin well they are shams you know it is the pillow within that gives a sham life honestly i did not expect this kind of quality for the price i paid very well made excellent price perfect purchase thank you so much,126,35
1844,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,the comforter is very very soft and holds heat very well the only complaint i have is that the down feathers seem to be coming out but I am sure this would be solved with a duvet cover as i do not have one,42,36
1845,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,this is a great product for the price i have it on my bed now and looks wonderful,18,37
1846,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i was not very satisfied with this product it is very thin and do not feel like a down comforter i guess there is little down fill in there i did not want to deal with the return procedure and pay the shipping to send it back so i end up kept it to use on the sofa,56,38

1848,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,this is a good comforter for the price amazon is selling it for i wish the microsuede was on both sides because you can only feel the softness if you are sleeping on it it is also kind of short for a queen bed,43,40
1849,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,we got a great deal and worth the money it does have a luxurious feeling it does it is job well keeps you warm,20,41
1850,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,the price was really good however it was very thin and not very warm i would have to however that the worst part about the blanket is that it sheds feathers all over the place basically rendering it useless do not buy unless you like feathers all over your pajamas and floor,52,42
1851,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,this is just cheap all over but i guess for the price what do you expect i now use it as a pillowtop for my mattress and it is fulfulling that duty pretty well,33,43
1852,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1.0,negative,if i had known that down fill means feathers i would not have brought thisfeathers were everywhere i would not recommend thisto no one only if they like feathers very dissatisfied,35,44
1853,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i like this quilt because i do not have to worry about the cover twisting around but i have had it for a year and it is not going to survive much longer it is losing feathers at an alarming rate,38,45
1854,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,this is a nice warm mild weather comforter it is soft and comfie but suffers from a common failing it leaks a few feathers now and again,26,46
1855,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2.0,negative,i got one of these and after a few days feathers are coming out everywhere looks ok and feels nice but not worth the mess it makes pulling feathers out,31,47

1858,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4.0,positive,i really love this comforter set i read a couple of reviews before i purchased it so i knew what to expect it is not too big and fluffy which is fine for me because I had rather wash it myself than send it to the dry cleaners it is very soft and comfortable and i complimented it with some nice throw pillows so it looks awesome,64,50
1859,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,i ordered this down comforter set in brown for my 13yo son i just love it and more importantly so does he he has never had a down comforter before and could not believe how warm and cozy it is the brown microsuede is an impressive and durable fabric just before writing this review i asked him what his review would be his reply was it was sent straight from heaven yeah a little dramatic but he really loves it the reverse side of the comforter is a cotton or a cotton blend that is slightly lighter inthan the microsuede i will be using the bedskirt to construct some box pleat valances for his room just because with everything on his bed it was just too much brown i am also going to be ordering this set for my youngest sister who was jealous that a 12 year old had this nice of a comforter set she thought it was a 200 set,164,51
1860,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,my boyfriend and i just bought a new house and now that we are unpacked we finally have a chance to start decorating the house is very modern so we are using a lot of black and chrome for our accent colors i was a bit impulsive when purchasing this set however the fact that the duvet is down and that it came with a matching dust ruffle really sold me the dust ruffle brings the entire set together it provides a much sleeker look i was hoping the down duvet would have been a little thicker but overall i am very impressed with what i was able to get for the money in addition i thought the pillow shams were perfect usually shams are too thick and bulky so i do not put them on the pillows i sleep with however these shams were thinner yet elegant and very soft / comfortable enough to place on a pillow you will be sleeping with not just for decoration great buy excellent value,168,52
1861,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,at first i was not that thrilled i thought it would be fluffier / fuller and the shams looked really cheap however i went and checked out some other down comfronters and realized that they were the same fill as mine and they were 6x the price after a nights sleep i was in love it was soft soothing and warm the next day i matched it with a bright pink 300tc sateen sheet set from amazon and it really made it pop the next day when i came in from work i felt like i was in a new room it even looked as if i spent much more than i did it is a great buy the shams are still cheap looking but you can dress them up with extra pillows from the money you save,134,53
1862,Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5.0,positive,3999 for a great little comforter set got the chocolate brown one to put on bed in our lake cabin and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality very warm soft and nice looking comes with comforter 2 shams and bed skirt we got free shipping so even better deal,50,54
1863,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,i would just say on this pot and pan cover that it is heavy weight cover and must be a different one that i saw before i purchased one i thought it was going to be real light but when i received it it was definitely a heavy weight lid for 10 it was a real bargain they must have made it heavier since the one in the article do not buy a 12 inch one this is good for only a 10 inch it is excellent,85,0
1864,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,this lid with it is double-ply construction is much better than those available locally in the kitchen departments of discount and hardware stores it has no sharp edges it arrived a little bent but was easily straightened it would have been nice if the description included the fact that it was aluminum this should not be assumed,55,1
1865,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,this thing is tiny too small to cover my 10 inch frying pan guess i should have paid more attention to the dimensions into the trash it goes,28,2

1867,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,sad that a made in united states item is so flimsy was delivered with minor dents and discolored when used to cover a frying pan containing sliced potatoes prior review that mentions not good for covering 12 pans is misleading it barely covers a 10 1/4 8 griswold ci frying pan,50,4
1868,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,have a number of odd-ball or miscellaneous pots and pots you want a lid for it but it either never came with one or you have lost it your savior is at hand i have been using mine for years and is pretty beat-up and abused the fit is kinda awkward for smaller pans the fit is usually rather loose plus it will not fit 12 inch skillets still i love mine and would never give it up you might want to consider another brand that will cover a 12 inch pan,92,5
1869,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,i wanted something really light weight to keep in our rv and this one does the job perfectly it is very light weight and it would honestly be easy to bend but it is perfect for what i wanted it for,39,6

1876,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,this arrived bent and it was flimsy and pretty much a piece of junk unfortunately i needed it immediately so i could not return it while i did not expect it to be a stellar piece of equipment i did expect it to be a little bit more substantial than the lids on my grandsons toy cook set would never buy it again,64,13
1877,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,way overpriced poor quality something you would find in a dollar store,11,14

1932,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,must not be exactly 10 inches did not fit pot too small for a 10 inch round pot flimsy material,21,69
1933,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,i like this a lot originally i had no covers love the face that i do not have a dozen lids floating around on the smaller side than expected but still a good buy,33,70
1934,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,i would like this same lid in a 12 version it works pretty good for 10 skillets it makes a good spare for my dutch oven that shares a lid with one of my skillets,35,71
1935,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,I have had this lid for years and although i still used it the handle was loose and it was so old i could not tighten the screw when i saw these i ordered myself two use them every day they are light quick fit well in dishwasher and they fit most anything love this reasonable lid,55,72
1936,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,i use this pan cover on my 10 frying pan and on my 8 pot lightweight easy to clean aluminum top good value for money,25,73
1937,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,the first time i used and washed it it got discolored also it did not fit the large pan i bought it for it was too small cheap looking also,31,74
1938,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,not worth the price a rip off probably worth a 150 but no more i would not recommend anyone buying this,22,75
1939,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,fits all my pots and pans had one but had given it away glad i was able to get another one,21,76
1940,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,looks great and fits my pan thank you very much i have larger pans that i could use a bigger cover for 12 inch,28,77
1941,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,i wanted a replacement lid for a 10-inch dutch oven and was trying to save money by not buying a glass lid one amazon reviewer said about this fitz-all lid i love mine and would never give it up that was a great endorsement so i bought one it is 10 1/8 inches in diameter the aluminum has a concentric circles design with a very slight concave to the underside the lid sits flush on top of my dutch oven with no lip orto keep it from sliding no problem although and it does a good job keeping in the steam when slow simmering chili or spaghetti sauce make sure to measure the pots you have to see if it will fit the 10 1/8 size my dutch oven is cast iron inner diameter 9 7/8 inches and outer diameter 10 1/8 inches which works fine with this lid i have not tried it on smaller-sized pots / pans yet but that is supposed to be one of it is advantages handling a range of sizes,175,78
1942,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,this is a joke it looks and feels like the toy pots and pans sets we used as children it is not big enough to cover most pans and it is too lightweight and cheap cheap cheap cheap do not waste your money,40,79
1943,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,the lid was already bent when i got it just a bit but just taking it to the kitchen using it the first time it was all bent out of shape from being thin soft material so it did not fit the pots tight went to wal mart and came across a really good one that is half glass,59,80
1944,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,these covers are flimsy thin but it would have still serve the purpose i had intended for them if they were smaller i did not realize that they were so big i needed smaller pot covers so these are just not suitable,41,81
1945,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,it looks really ugly and is very small for even small pans i do not recommend it to any one,20,82
1946,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,can cover something will simmering then use same lid for another fry pan or pot less clean up just are very useful product,23,83
1947,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,the first time i used the cover it warped now it does not seal thebetween the pan and the cover the steam pours out it was a cheap product at a cheap price,34,84
1948,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,i was super angry when my pot lid shattered into pieces most other replacements were super expensive and this one is cheap and affordable and gets the job done it will not be a snug fit on your pot but i did not need it to be so it worked great for me,51,85
1949,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,my own fault that i did not measure my pan but other than that this works a little better than using a plate to cover your pan because you can grab the knob and not burn your fingers mine came with the knob sort of bent and a small dent but I am quite sure that was because of poor packaging shipping was quick although,63,86
1950,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,i was trying to save some money on 8 - 10 in pan lids as a result I have wasted my money on these very poor quality not safe around the kitchen they get so hot in instant if you missed the handle you may get burnt easily go with the real glass ones 3x/4x more expensive although but in a long run it is totally worth it,65,87
1951,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,the picture appeared to be a pot and pan top of quality very low level of a top i would not recommend to purchase does not hold head well when cooking does not clean well,35,88
1952,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,i received this full of dents with a screw and no handle the only reason i am not returning it is because it will cost me more to send it back then what it is worth i have been looking for a cover for months then found this and thought it was the end of my search forget it a peice of crap do not order this product,70,89
1953,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,as others have mentioned it is made of aluminum and very big on small pots and pans still it meets the basic need,23,90
1954,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,my boyfriend and i have all sorts and brands of pans from over the years and have misplaced lids this works well on all our pots thanks,27,91
1955,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,this lid is flimsy but better than nothing it also does not sit adequately on the pot if you have handles on your pot,23,92
1956,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,great for those lidless pots it fits any pots up to 10 only drawback is that it does not fit my largest frying pan which is 12,26,93
1957,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,i use this lid every day it replaced one that was years old the size is perfect it fits every pot I have set it on,25,94
1958,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2.0,negative,when i received the package it was already bent up probably because it is not made very well the metal is thin and if you throw it around too much it will definitely bend i suppose it is good for your most basic needs but other than that do not be afraid to dish out a little extra to get a better lid,59,95
1959,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5.0,positive,I am not sure what lid the other reviewers received who said that theirs was flimsy because the one i received is very strong it would be hard to bend or dent this it is small but it is perfect for small pans i like it,44,96
1960,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,it does what i need it to do it is very light weight and would be easy to bend out of shape but it is the answer to a need i have other pots and pan lids are just to big,39,97
1961,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1.0,negative,the description says that this lid fits all but it does not and the material is so cheap i needed it for a casserole that i have bought from goodwill but it did not even come close and it is a 16 casserole,41,98
1962,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,this is a must-have for users of many skillets that lack lids or for those who do not want to clutter up the kitchen with tons of glass lids i agree with the reviewer who said it is flimsy which is why i gave it four stars instead of five mine had a teeny tiny dent in it but really no biggie not as good quality as the old one i have but useful nonetheless as i need one for home and one for the camper,86,99
1963,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4.0,positive,there has nothing wrong with this lid other than i did not think it through in terms of size before ordering this is not big enough for a large fry pan I shall keep it anyway since it is a decent lid or other pots but if you need it for a large fry pan you need at least 12 1/2 lid and this one is only 10,65,100
2066,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,this is bigger than most trunk jack stands i bought this for my mazda 6 2008 does the job good price soild metal,23,0
2067,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,the crappy little jack that came with my prius fell over when lifting the prius on the flat street in front of my house when it fell it bent i went to replace it and discovered it was 179 or something like that this looks have not used it yet twice as strong,52,1
2068,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,thiswas just as described in the ad and arrived on time it is nice to get a great deal,21,2
2069,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,the jack i ordered was not able to lift my car and was slightly different from the product advertised the company responded with several different options to meet my needs and included detailed information about the replacement options along with pictures i still do not know of the replacement items will do the job they have not arrived yet but the company gets a gold star for working hard to help me,69,3
2070,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,i used four of the jacks as leveling jacks on my small travel trailer i had to modify them to be permanently attached to the frame of my rv they are sturdy and work well for my purpose if you simply want them as a car jack for changing a tire i believe they will suffice the maximum height extension is limited about 18 20 so keep that in mind,71,4
2071,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,it is a car jack after all and a good one it does it is job well and it is easy to use no complains about this product i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a car jack,41,5
2072,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,i bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well it did fit but it would not lift a 1000 lbalthough rated for 4000 lbs the screw was well lubricated with grease but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank it was cheap but still not worth the little money i paid,63,6
2073,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,cheap fell apart after 2nd use i was lifting my golf cart and it got stuck about half way through the lift i kinda worked with where it was when i was done i went to lower it and noticed it bent with such a littlei bought two of them the bent one went into the recycling bin and other is a garage paper weight,67,7
2074,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,this is a substitute for my 2500 and horse trailer jack works well too,14,8
2075,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,very poorly constructed rated for 2 tons but would not lift 1 tire of my 3000 pound car also it arrived damaged the put the jack in a box too small and simply punched holes in the end of the box for the two ends of the jack so of course both ends of the jack were damaged by the time it arrived,62,9
2076,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,i am not putting this in my wifes car that is what i bought it for but after opening it and extending it out i could see that the metal arms were loosely put together and rickety the screw mechanism is good and smooth but i do not trust this thing to hold up 4000 lbs without creaking one way or the other returning for sure I had rather hassle with sending it back and buying another one than worry every time i crawl under the car i recommend avoiding this jack,90,10
2077,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,the threaded rod or screw was galled up right out of the box was unable to even open it up all the way until i put the jack in a benchto hold it in place why i used a crow bar to work it back and forth 50 times to get it to free up at least they should test this piece of crap before they ship it after working on it for two hours i finally have a jack i can use,85,11
2078,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,jacks situation here in the us is a mess have to use a combination of jacks to change a flat scissors jack is just one that i use,28,12
2079,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,like someone else said it is a car jack what do you expect it was not built to lift the world,19,13
2080,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,the jack i received was somewhat different and had a different crank than the one pictured it was not possible to lift my car using the crank so i am sending it back,33,14
2081,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,my son used it 3 times to change a flat and 2 rear tires on my 97 ford probe and it worked great a little awkward turning but did the job perfectly otherwise the only kind that fit and was sturdy enough,42,15
2082,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,i like theit work really well i have no complains i paid 19 dollars for this so to me it is a good value,26,16
2083,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5.0,positive,just received this jack went outside and tested it out worked great lifted my 1998 chevy blazer with no problem the jack was able to lift my truck high enough that i could get a jack stand in and change a tire no problem i will be keeping this on board since i do not have the spare tire jack,59,17
2084,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1.0,negative,what a piece of junk do not purchase,8,18
2085,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4.0,positive,looks good hope i do not have to use it,10,19
2354,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4.0,positive,honestly i have nowhat this is supposed to do for my face in the long run i take care of the problem areas of my skin with other products so even if it did some small thing I had never know what i do know is the superfine mist feels awesome when my skin is overheated or tired during the day which will be a lot during the summer the mist is cool and slightly moisturizing without any daily long-term effects like greasiness or astringency I have been using it a couple of weeks and had no breakouts which means it passed a major product test for me in winter i would probably call this more of a luxury than a necessary beauty product but as we go into summer and the hot damaged skin season it seems more like something good to have on hand as a treat,149,0
2355,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2.0,negative,i do not see any benefits provided by this spray the stars I am giving are for the great design of the bottle i wish i had a bottle like this for all my sprays it is right between being a mist and a spray so it layers on your skin nicely but I have used this on myself repeatedly now and see no benefits or any kind of difference on my skin i do not recommend it seems like a gimmicky waste of money,80,1
2356,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2.0,negative,i do not really get it I have been using this product for a few weeks and I have not noticed any benefit my skin does not feel or look different i can see where a mist would feel refreshing after working out or during the summer i think it is important to moisturize right after washing my face with clean water to help retain the moisture it is also my understanding that under most circumstances minerals and other nutrients work from the inside out not sprayed on top just to evaporate I am not sure what i was expecting with this spray as mentioned this will probably be refreshing on a hot day but I am just not seeing any other benefit,115,2
2357,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5.0,positive,i have a condition called keratosis pilaris on my legs and my face i have tried many products to help with this some work and some do not i have been using this for about a week and i am pretty pleased with the results first of all parts of my face are extremely dry while other parts are somewhat oily i find that this spray works well for my combination skin it feels moisturized but not greasy i wash my face with a charcoal soap then spray this on and allow it to dry naturally and apply my makeup as usual i also use it when i need a refresher midday and before bed i love it,118,3
2358,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4.0,positive,this is a lot like the previous vichy product i tried vichy puret thermale 3-in-1 onemicellar cleansing water but the application process is quite different this is a product you just spray on your face i kept my eyes closed when i did this and tried to keep it out of my hair i left the spray on for a couple of minutes the directions are vague in this regard the product felt a bit sticky as the previous product from vichy did but in this case the directions said to dry my face off after that vague amount of time and that helped with the stickiness the application was a bit off-putting for me i did not feel like it gave me enough control over how much went on my skin and where it went even after using it for two weeks i never felt completely comfortable with it it did not irritate my very sensitive skin and the stickiness was removed with wiping it off but the application oddness and the fact that this product did not do anything to improve my skin means i will not buy it,190,4
2359,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4.0,positive,my wife will not put any chemicals or weird things on her skin she sticks primarily to pure oil products that do not contain things such as alcohol or preservatives she has tried vichy a number of times after bathing and found it pleasant but she feels inconclusive on it is benefits it is always difficult to determine whether certain products are really having a positive effect this would include things such as skin care products vitamins and food supplements it can only be judged on a subjective level which is prone to all kinds of variables unless something has immediately caused a bad reaction or problem tough to tell it seems that there is nothing bad in the vichy which is why she agreed to try it so far she says it is nice,131,5
2360,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4.0,positive,testing this as a free product from the amazon vine program this is a very nice and easy to use product that has become part of the daily routine fine mist spray that moisturizes withour ever feeling greasy or like you are wearing a mudpack so easy to spray and go let it sit for a minute and gently dry time will tell on the results but my skin feels great the research backing up this product seems credible after an internet search,82,6
2361,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5.0,positive,my wife has used this for three days after washing her face she sprayed it on then dabbed it off after it had been on for a few minutes then she said her skin felt soft and smooth the softness she noted lasted all day much longer than when she used lotion unless product is extremely expensive it looks like they have got a steady customer one note my wife does not use makeup we do not know if her highly positive reaction would be less or perhaps even more dramatic weee she one who did,95,7
2362,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5.0,positive,i am familiar with vichy products and have always had a positive experience with products from this brand i was not sure what to expect from a can of expensive water the bar was low for this unfortunately i had a skin reaction to a food allergy and my skin was dry irritated and a bumpy broken out mess having previously dealt with this condition i know that it takes about 2 weeks to completely heal the vichy mineralizing thermal spray water arrived on day 2 of my reaction I have used it daily for the past 5-days and the bumps / irritation has almost completely disappeared the skin that I have used it on is no longer itchy or dry i have no new bumps or dermatitis I am sold on this product,128,8
2363,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2.0,negative,i love thismy issue is how it was packaged and arrived the ttem arrived unsealed with a cracked top with a large hole in it the rest of the top is not in the box so it appears it was packaged broken also it feels lighter than 10 oz bottle sounds half full when shaken like it may have been previously used I have ordered a bottle of this previously with no issues it was sealed and the top was unbroken and securely on,85,9
2364,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,1.0,negative,the product receive is fake not authentic i been using the vichy thermal water in the past and has a different consistency the one receive it just plain water no mineral fake product so disippont,35,10
2365,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5.0,positive,this is a nice mineral water spray it is unique in that it contains salts in amounts you can taste some may not like that but i find it soothing for eczema prone skin,33,11
2366,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,1.0,negative,i purchased this product in september and by mid-november it was clogged to the point that it would not spray anymore i am very disappointed in the efficiency and usefulness of this container i probably used less than a 1/4th of the bottle,43,12
2367,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5.0,positive,i feel so refreshed after using this spray after using every morning for over a week i could see a difference in my skin much softer and smooth,28,13
2368,Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2.0,negative,i guess that i do not have the sophistication to appreciate a 18 can of mineral water that has 101 ounces in it i used this product as directed and nothing it is refreshing to spray on your face when it is clean but i think that i can get the same effect by taking a spray bottle and using some good old american mineral water i am not sure why the french mineral water is so much better than mineral water made any place else but for 25 cents for a 20 ounce bottle compared to 18 i think that i will buy american mineral water i am also a believer that your skin must be hydrated from the inside out you can spray the entire can on your whole body but if you have not put fluids inside your body it is not going to do any good my entire family gets together on the 4th of july for a pool party and i plan to use the vichy spray to keep me cool while I am sitting outside in the heat by the pool and plan to drink lots and lots of water to keep me hydrated,198,14
2458,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5.0,positive,great arrived in time and works as described,8,0

2461,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2.0,negative,have had zwilling clippers in the past these do not match the quality of those these sometimes feel like they might break apart instead of clipping your nail,28,3
2462,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2.0,negative,not as good as all stainless steel ones,8,4
2463,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4.0,positive,the small clippers worked ust fine however the large clippers did not quite work up to par otherwise great pair,19,5
2464,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1.0,negative,very poor design and very hard to use their other ones are better,13,6
2465,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4.0,positive,i had nothis is popular in china until my sister in beijng asked me to order 10 of them as gifts obviously it is a popular brand and perfect fit as a small gift for fiends,38,7
2466,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4.0,positive,accurate but a little clunky very sharp i have an older model which is more compact,16,8
2467,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2.0,negative,so disappointed on it is quality and it is really hard to handle it i had an old pair of zwilling ja hemckels nail clipper for more than 10 years in different model and i loved it so much for it is quality this particular model has no comparison to my old one after few uses i think the only way for it to work well is to clip tiny piece by piece very frustrated,72,9
2468,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4.0,positive,i had one of these before and i can say they changed something in the manufacturing before it cut no problem i lost the original one i bought and ordered a replacement that works meh still it is the best but you have to put a bit more effort into it,50,10
2469,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2.0,negative,nail clipper is sharp enough blade built after the shape is not good,13,11
2470,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1.0,negative,a truly stupid design the plastic handle flexes which means they simply do not cut,15,12
2471,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1.0,negative,a truly stupid design that should never have been released to the market the plastic handle flexes which means they simply do not cut these have gone in the bin I am off to the 2 shop to find some that actually cut,42,13
2472,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5.0,positive,very comfortable to use cuts nails very well,8,14
2473,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4.0,positive,the head does rotate and that is great but the width of the clipper is narrow making it more appropriate for children than adults,23,15
2474,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,2.0,negative,it is too big gigger than other nail clipper and the head is not fixed often turning but still sharp,19,16
2475,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,1.0,negative,these are the worst clippers i have ever used they are dull and the swivel does not work as well as one might think definitely not what i expected from this company,31,17
2476,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5.0,positive,love these clippers sturdy easy to hold especially love that the clip part swivels to make it easier to use right or left handed,24,18
2477,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,4.0,positive,i like this clipper even although the handle is a little odd shaped,13,19
2478,Luxury_Beauty,B00FWUKJ2M,5.0,positive,i love these clippers since i was diagnosed with ra eight years ago I have really struggled with finding clippers that were small and easy to maneuver but also easy to hold the rotating head makes cuts possible from any angle and the large plastic handles are easy to grip i love these and am already planning to give them as gifts to my family this year i know that sounds strange but trust me my family goes crazy for things like this easily the best pair of clippers I have ever owned,91,20

2483,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5.0,positive,great product packaging for this product although i liked the stick this is just as good,16,0
2484,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1.0,negative,something is wrong with the formula or storage they are grainy beads in both the tub and tube love this stuff but it is become unusable as this point super sad,30,1
2485,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,2.0,negative,has anyone found a replacement for this product the tube form was all i used to use and while i bought my years supply of this already i have to apply it 5x as often and still have dry chapped lips plus this product comes out of the tube gritty not lovely until it literally melts i would love to find a new tea tree oil lip balm that is good if anyone has any suggestions,76,2
2486,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5.0,positive,i have used this product for years and i love it,11,3
2487,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5.0,positive,very healing if your lips are dry or cracked it has nice tingle from the tea tree as well glossy and shiny so i do not need lipstick or gloss with it,31,4
2488,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,4.0,positive,i love epicuren and have used several of their products for years this balm is one of my favorite epicuren products and i recommend it to everyone it is a little slicker and oilier than other lip balms and is very hydrating and the hydration last the whole time i am wearing it i actually started making my own lip balm after i could not find epicuren when i moved however i recently rediscovered it and now it is in every bag i find many other lip balms to be drying or waxy after awhile so i only use epicuren or my own i recommend this to everyone i know absolutely worth the price as i have thrown away many other more expensive lip balms because they hydrate for a little while and then are very drying 4 out of 5 stars because i preferred the older packaging twist-up tube for application but understand why they switched to a squeezable tube,158,5
2489,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,2.0,negative,unlike the epicurean lip balm in the small container this one is too much in liquid form and is not long lasting i will not buy this again,28,6
2490,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1.0,negative,this used to be my favorite lip balm i used the one in the little pot or chapstick form for years i loved the old version because it did not have a sunscreen taste or smell just the tea tree smell i dislike sunscreen taste / smell in products but you got to use them it was smooth and really moisturized my lips it was my go to always and kept me from getting burnt lips at the beach but this new version is terrible not only is it sunscreen tasting it is feels different and i do not like the tube still searching for something as great as the old product,107,7
2491,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,5.0,positive,most amazing lip balm i have ever used it leaves a very alive feeling i only wish they sold it again in a tube roll on like other lip balms,30,8
2492,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1.0,negative,very disappointed the tube version was my very favorite balm ever can not get it anymore tried this makes lips more chapped had an off texture of clumpy little balls wish they made the balm chapstick tube type again i would buy like 10 tubes,43,9
2493,Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1.0,negative,not the same as it use to be very poor quality,11,10
2725,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1.0,negative,i hate this stand the cymbal is always tilting to the side or some thing the boom has two grips at the bottom so you can not do alot with it she came in fast but will not last spend 10 more bucks on the others,44,0
2726,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,i bought two of these stands they look really new but their construction is very basic such as on the boom arm connector there is no spring inside the joint just a wing nut and a screw i have not played seriously with them yet but so far they seem pretty strudy and stable,53,1
2727,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,i purchased 6 of these stands I am going to get another 6 my drums are played at home so i do not know how much these stand would hold up to real world use but for the money they are really good,40,2
2728,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,the boom stand is exactly what i expected quality is very good for the money i am happy with my purchase,21,3
2729,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,it serves the purpose nice for the price i would buy another when i need anotherdo not hesitateit is a nice stand to own,21,4
2730,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,great stand for the price lightweight compacts really tight and strong enough to hold my cymbal through my intense playing,20,5
2731,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2.0,negative,i got what i paid for a cheap piece of junk that will break as soon as i put the least bit of pressure on it i just hope that it will hold a small cymbal at all,38,6
2732,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,this is an excellent product shipping was as always extremely fast assembly was non-existent very heavy duty for the price i thought it would be junk and was pleasantly surprised it could handle a zildjian 22 ride easily due to the dounterweight,42,7
2733,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2.0,negative,this cymbal stand was an ok replacement it might be alright temporarily for a beginner drummer otherwise i would not really recommend this stand to anyone,26,8
2734,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,5.0,positive,it is absolutely incredible i bought it about a year ago and have never had a problem with the thing it started shaking one time when i first put my new 20 ride but i widened the base of it and now it does not move at all no matter how hard i hit it cheaply made yes sturdy yes buy it now yes,62,9
2735,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1.0,negative,this is basically the worse cybal stand I have ever used i bought it because of the price and figured what the he shall its cheap turns out this an understatement the wing nut to hold the cymbal on is plastic the stand does not hold the boom arm no matter how hard to you tighten it I have converted it into a straight stand until i can buy a better one save your money for something well built,75,10
2736,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,I have purchased 3 of these stands I have been very pleased with the stands i use my stands for a home kit that i have i never break them down so i do not know how durable they would be for someone who is playing gigs and constantly breaking them down for a home kit or back up stand for the road they are a great value,65,11
2737,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,1.0,negative,mine snapped within 5 minutes of playing literally broke into pieces i do not play metal it is a piece of crap returned mine for refund the boom part cracked in 2 places it is in the trash the weight at the end is the only part that survived i do not know why it is even on there i have a rack by them I am contemplating returning it or just use gibraltar parts on their rack boom is literally garbage unless mine is faulty i doubt it get what you pay for,88,12
2738,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,2.0,negative,good for cheap cymbals would not put anything expensive on them the metal rod keyholes the cymbals fairly quickly,18,13
2739,Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,this stand is and awesome stand it is very sturdy durable accessible to add attachment not bad in weight for use in travel love this boom stand not to mention easy setup,30,14
2766,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,guitar came with all promised materials although it had some cosmetic damage to the neck of the guitar the seller did stipulate that due to the manufacture process this might occur i do not think it harms the sound quality good guitar for someone just starting out and not worried about the instrument looking perfect,54,0
2767,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i recommend buying this for beginners the guitar design is ok but the sound is awesome i did not recieve a ebook which is ok instead i got this thing which sounds like a kazoo very low price for an awesome guitar,42,1
2768,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i like the guitar it is is nice cosidering how inexpensive it is but it did not come with an ebook like it claimed instead it came with a pitch pipe,29,2
2769,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,for 20 more i got an acoustic guitar from musicians friend rogue that is much better,16,3
2770,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,strings broke the first time i tried to play it,10,4
2771,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,this is proof you get what you pay for the wood it is made of is basically paper thin i feel like if i strum too hard it will shatter I had say only a true beginner who can not spend more than 100 would be ok with this,46,5
2772,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,for a cheap beginner guitar i understand the poor quality but i do not see how anyone can learn to play on this thing the strings do not even make a proper tone and had to be replaced i recommend spending 30 more dollars and getting something a bit better,48,6
2773,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,surprisingly had a vary pretty sound but felt awkward in hands while playing and the neck snapped do to humidity and heat you get what you pay for tho good starter guitar,32,7
2774,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,if you are thinking about buying this guitar do not its not worth it it has no trust bar which means the more you play it the more out of tune it will get i like how it looks looks okay on my wall i guess but if you want to buy a guitar even just to learn on i suggest you spend the 150 and get a really decent guitar you seriously will not regret it and you definitely will not waste your money on a board with strings,85,8
2775,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar has started to break apart and it is not even two years old very very poor quality not good,20,9

2777,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,ok the guitar is obviously good for the price but the thing is i clearly ordered the cutaway style and i got the regular style and that 's not cool,29,11
2778,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i bought this at the request of my daughter for her birthday she wanted a starter acoustic guitar because she hoped to learn how to play it this product taught me the value of reading amazon reviews before purchasing anything the guitar itself was scratched and banged up pretty bad when we got it the decorative label on the front is a very cheaply put on sticker with bubbles on it the case is thinvinyl like material that had tears in it and the zipper broke on the second use more importantly this guitar can not be tuned we have had it restrung and i have taken it to three different music shops and they all say the same thing worst guitar they have ever seen you get what you pay for that is for sure,135,12
2779,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,when i opened it i had a trusted friend tune it and the neck immediately started bowing and within the next day the frame cracked not only that but you could see where they would spray painted it black in the heart of it not worth the money even as a beginner spring for a nicer guitar this one would not hold a tune for more than 3 seconds anyway and the case was nothing more than a cheap bag not impressed,80,13
2780,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this guitar was broke right from the box the kneck was broke loose from the body would not recommend this guitar,21,14
2781,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i was extremely disappointed in this product it did not come with the pitch pipe to tune it it did not come with the strap it did not come with the case it did not come with any extra strings or pics it was supposed to come with all of that i did not complain because amazon is the middle man from what i understand and i had other more important issues to deal with at the time and a big chunk of wood fell out of the guitar as soon as i lifted it out of the box I am not sure if it was a piece to this guitar or from another,107,15
2782,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,chips everywhere the only good thing is came on time would return it but by time i do it will cost me more in the end,26,16
2783,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this is the first guitar i have bought I am a beginner and amy friend is teaching me he had 20 years of experience and he says the guitar has a good sound the strings are not that hard to tell apart the guitar does smell like chemicals when you first open it just let it vent out over all i have no problems with it i think i got a lot more than what i paid for,77,17
2784,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this product is very small if you wanted to play it or get lessons this would not be theto order spend the extra money on a real guitar,29,18

2789,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,as the previous posters mentioned it has an odor when you first open the box it is a christmas gift so i let it air out in my work office for a week or so no smell now it was just the paint / lacquer overall I am quite pleased several coworkers that are musicians noticed it in my office and looked it over they said the quality was actually quite good especially for the price,73,23
2790,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,good starter guitar for a bigger my teenage son needed a beginner acoustic guitar for guitar class at his high school my husband and i did not want to spend a lot of money and he ending up not liking it we thought this was a good start to see how well he takes care of the guitar before considering an expensive guitar the bag it came with was a huge joke very cheap and very thin within a week of school the zipper on the bag broke my husband fixed it but it happened again as far as i know nothing wrong with the guitars sound,107,24
2791,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,my son is two and loves music this is a sturdy childs guitar that seems like it was built to take a beating which in our house is pretty much guaranteed laughing out loud the only thing i had a slight issue with was the guitar arrived with some chips in the finish but that may have occurred during shipment but it is merely cosmetic damage and like i said it will probably get more within it is lifetime,74,25
2792,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,horrible costumer service my guitar had a problem and they wanted me to pay shipping to send it back it was more then the cost of the guitar bad quality never go back again the guitar is in the trash it was cheaper to throw it out bad experience,51,26
2793,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i expected this to be a cheap guitar i expected it to smell like chemicals as other posters warned i should have read further warnings as i would have saved myself time effort and money this should not even be sold as a guitar maybe as decor i bought this for a little girl who is trying to find her niche and was interested in picking up guitar she could not even get anof whether or not she would enjoy playing since no one could play this thing with every strum it went out of tune every single strum you would play a chord three times and every strum it would be a different note as the crap pegs failed to do their job a kazoo is more of an instrument than this thing what a waste,138,27
2794,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this was a christmas gift for my husband and for the price was any awesome deal it came fast and looked even better than in the picture,27,28
2795,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,okay so the first thing is i received a completely different guitar i received a guitar that buzzes at the frets will not stay in tune and when we tried to tune it the last string broke 3 times the one i was supposed to get was a barcelona according to the images but i got a crescent which is a very cheaply made guitar i smelled chemicals coming off of it you can tell where paint was sprayed on and paint drippings I am sorry but i do not like this guitar i do not think it was worth it i was good at first although,104,29
2796,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this is a classical guitar with steel strings on it does not stay tuned sounds like crap even for the low cost it is not worth it at all,27,30
2797,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this is a good beginner guitar dislikes the guitar is a little smaller than expected there are minor damages and scratches the delivery was late strap is a little small likes holds a pitch well many replacement strings beautifuland tone very affordable overall a great guitar for the price and would recommend this guitar to start up beginners,59,31
2798,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,it is a nice guitar to start out i got this one for my son and he likes it he has still a bit too small for it but it will work for the time being,34,32

2803,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,a cutaway is used to gain access to the upper frets any child learning on this guitar will be bale to play bar chords further up the neck that a traditional guitar i thought the finish was good the guitar solid it is an excellent beginners guitar and the cutaway for upper fret access is simply a bonus,58,37
2804,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,poor quality only lasted my kids a couple months wood on guitar is warping an the strings broke requesting refund it is junk,20,38
2805,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the product is good it is the same guitar that i have only mine is a sky but it appears they are made by the same folks,27,39
2806,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,the body is too lightweight it feels like i could break it with my hands strings are cheap and the tuning screws are cheap and do not hold a tune which is replaceable except i think i might actually bend the neck with real strings and replacing t he tuning screws is too much work to be done on a finished product at least in my opinion bag is not padded at all so it is basically an oversized ziploc,79,40
2807,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,but my daughter will start taking a class in september so then we will find out if is any good,20,41
2808,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,shoddy manufacturing smeared glue and paint and still no response about a refund weeks after i complained about it do not waste your money,24,42

2810,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i ordered two guitars off amazon for my daughters who have been taking lessons a few weeks with passed-down gear we just wanted to get something cheap but serviceable until we were sure they would stick with it this was the second one to arrive it was not even the guitar we ordered came in differentmy oldest daughter decided she liked it better than the one that came for my younger daughter however has a much more discerning ear and found both to have a lousy sound very tinny this model seems to hold it is tune a little better than i would have expected although one of the reasons we bought this is that it was listed for around 20 but was originally 120 so i thought it could not be that bad i was wrong i think the seller exaggerated the original price to make the product look better and then offered it at a discount do not be ripped off do not buy it,164,44
2811,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar is absolutely wonderful i have had it for 6 months and i play it all the time it has excellent sound quality and it is great for beginner guitar players,31,45

2819,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the first time i played the guitar the string broke and when i brought it to sam ash to have it fixed they told me i could not do it because it was actually warped probably from being stored in an improper temperature setting i definitely would not recommend this,48,53

2822,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i wanted a cheap guitar to be able to carry around to beaches and overseas without fear of being damaged or stolen this was a bargain so i did not think too much it looks way better than it costsnatural and it sounds very decent i am tuning it using a simple free program it was not available when i was a kid and it sounds great the strings look fine much better and softer than i hoped for plus it comes with two spare strings e and b which is nice it lacks fret markings and the goldenon the frets is already dissipating but who cares the neck is super straight and the wood seems of better quality than i bargained for the bag is made of very thin and weak material that does not look it will survive much travel but then i am not a traveling musician the pitch pipe is useless the stripe looks strong and fine i do not know why would other customers complain about it the shipping and delivery was prompt i am very satisfied definitely more than worth the money,191,56
2823,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i bought this guitar for my girlfriend for christmas because she wanted to learn guitar the guitar is beautifully designed pros -beautiful guitar awesome price perfect beginner guitar cons -the strings were not on correctly did not come with a gig bag other than those 2 cons everything else about this was good so if you can change the strings and do not mind getting the bag i would suggest this,68,57
2824,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,the sound is amazing the wood is very hard and i like it so much theis very natural,20,58
2825,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i look for a guitar in internet and saw it it is true that it is very cheap but i expected at least functioning i should first find out that was chinese the strings are far from the neck so it is almost impossible to play the sound is bad specially one rope i do not recommend it at all,60,59
2826,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,worth the money good for kid and teens or whom ever want to learn or play the guitar only thing you need is sheet music book just go to youtude and learn how to play,35,60

2834,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this guitar is excellent for beginners the only thing is that when you put it inside the case you have to re-tune it when you take it back out but that is to be expected from a guitar this cheap but i highly recommend it for up and coming guitar players who want to test the waters of this instrument without paying 100 dollars for a good one and then not liking it also another kinda off thing is that the pitch pipe is a little off key how ironic right but you can look on youtube and and follow a tutorial on how to tune your guitar there so it is not a a really big deal also i noticed alot of people complaining about a chemical smell i did not experience that i guess it has to do with theof your guitar or something and also this seller says that they will give you a learning the guitar book but it is not a hard copy it is an email so if it does not show up in the mail with the guitar case just know that it is not a mistake check your email all in all i think it is an excellent guitar for the price,203,68

2845,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i understand that you get what you pay for but the frets could still be in the right place it can be tuned openly but many chords sound out of tune because the frets are either too wide or too narrow,41,79

2878,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i have been looking for another guitar since mine was destroyed in an accident this guitar is a great little starter guitar i have been looking for another full size guitar and happened across this one and for the price i could not pass it up i thought that a 38 guitar was a little bigger then i remember but again for the price you can not go wrong the strap is shorter then i can use but being lightweight that is not really an issue i would highly recommend this guitar to others as a great gift for kids or anyone as a starter and something to learn on,109,112

2885,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,agreed that for this price we should not expect for a good quality but at least the guitar should be playable for beginners to learn i noticed the following problems which i had to fix it myself when i got my shipment the height of the saddle was to short which resulted in strings touching the neck and frets producing irritating sounds no position markers the vendor provides a belt but there were no hooks on the body to attach with the only thing i liked was it is very light in weight,92,119
2886,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the guitar is improperly built the tuning pegs need to turn too far the neck is barely attached to the body the instrument will not stay in tune long enough to play a chord do not buy this,37,120
2887,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i am so disappointed that my daughter spend her money on thisit was so cheap and had to be thrown away do not waste your money on this,30,121

2889,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i wanted an inexpensive beginner guitar for my kids to learn on i did not want to waste money and then find out they have lost interest in guitar unfortunately once this guitar is tuned after strumming it once it goes right out of tune this would be good to purchase as a prop but not to play,57,123
2890,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the first day that my son took his guitar to school the music teacher said it could not be tuned and he needed a new one on a positive note i informed amazon of the problem and my money was refunded within 72 hours,43,124
2891,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,everyone bitchin about how this guitar sucks laughing out loud as soon as i opened the box i expected to smell the bad odor as everyone was complaining about no odor oh and an e-book stands for electronic book you can download it from your email i also tuned this guitar just fine,51,125
2892,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar is only for learning it is very cheaply made but works as a teaching tool i only still have the guitar because the bag was cheap and ripped,29,126
2893,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,so i just got this guitar like a month ago and i can honestly say that i love it it came like 2 days after i ordered it which is excellent the only problems i had with thiswas trying to tune it and trying to figure out how to attach the strap i only had one peg for the strap the smell of the guitar which people say it smelt chemical was actually the smell of the wood when it has some kind of preservative so it will not rot overall i am very pleased with this guitar i really want to play it but one of strings popped so i have to wait to get new ones the end k bye,140,127
2894,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,do not buy this guitar i hate this guitar i bought it and the sound is horrible it also has this bad plastic smell witch will not go away the strings are high off the fret do not waste your money it is so not worth it,44,128
2895,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,the guitar is good for it is price i received what i paid for the guitar sound great as well I am happy with my purchase,24,129
2896,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,this guitar came in pretty quickly and with all the advertised accessories but the guitar itself is a piece of crap it was manufactured in a way that no matter how much you try and tune it it always sounds off save yourself some grief and invest in a more expensive instrument,52,130
2897,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,i was not pleased with this product because it did not come with a cord guide or dot on the instrument for finger placement,24,131
2898,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,we bought this product so my daughter could learn to play not a goodthe guitar is so poorly made that it never got tuned she took it to a guitar place and they told her that it would get untuned as soon as she started playing and so it did the worse 17 i ever spent and i paid 12 in shipping,62,132
2899,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the guitar is awful-it can not be tuned thebetween the guitar and the strings is too big not possible to play barre-spend few extra dollars and buy better guitar you will be able to play,35,133

2901,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,the guitar came with all the accessories mentioned in the description and was in new condition however this guitar was made so badly that the frets were in the wrong positions some of them were a few millimeters off meaning that it was impossible to play this guitar without it sounding completely utterly horrible i was not able to play without having earplugs in my ears i did not expect much for such a cheap guitar but you should at least be able to play it this however was painful for my ears invest a couple bucks more,97,135
2902,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,i bought this guitar because it was cheap i did review the reviews about it because i knew a cheap guitar was not going to sound like a great guitar but i thought it would be good enough for what i needed it for my biggest problems with it is that it will not stay in tune also you can not tune it against itself using the fifth fret you have to use a tuner even when you use an electronic tuner it still sounds off now if you have a kid who thinks they want to learn to play the guitar and you do not want to spend the money i say it is worth it if they love it you can always spend more of the big bucks later i bought it because i have some people i work with who might very well put a giant hole in it with no warning for that I am ok with it,156,136
2903,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,the guitar is ok no easy tuner and no e-book as the description how you guys tall about this,22,137

2905,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the guitar came with a strap a pick a set of strings a harmonica a pitch pipe and a gig bag however i got the ebook the guitar itself is a great quality sound-wise the strap is very cheap looking and short which does not surprise me considering the price of the whole set,53,139
2906,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,great guitar for learners and the price is unbelievable also was shipped next day well worth money spent might buy another one for grandson,24,140
2907,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,wanted to order a cheap guitar for my little brother in law to start playing on because he got burned at the pawn shop on an electric guitar he spent his hard earned money on knew this one would be smaller but was not prepared for what i got it looks horrible nothing like the picture almost spray painted looking we already covered it in stickers it does play tho good for a toddler to trash not even worth the money for a beginner any older,85,141
2908,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,i enjoyed the guitar the paint job is for quality there are noticeable paint marks on the guitar and the strap on guitar does it work you only have one clip at the bottom of the guitar for this crap and the other end of other does not have one,49,142
2909,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,was glad to see that it came just two days after ordering when it said it would take a week nothing was broke or missing except for the ebook which i kind of expected from the other reviews the strap is kind of small but i do not plan on using it anyway all in all it is a very good guitar for the price thanks,64,143
2910,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,it is really worth for this price i love the package so i could just start when i received it and the quality is fine,24,144
2911,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,this guitar came with everything as advertised and an extra set of strings the guitar is small-ish but that is perfect for my small hands i got it on sale so with he total being 30 including shipping this guitar i worth well over the asking price and i am very satisfied,51,145
2912,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,received the guitar before the estimated delivery date smelt like spray paint but not too strongly a string was broken already so i went to use the replacement strings and the one needed was far too short contacted the seller and they said they would send me new strings at least the ebook was just some pdf file from a completely free website anyone can download the ebook at any point regardless of guitar purchase [ ] the pdf explains that you now own a guitar and it has strings if you touch the strings it will make noises probably the most informative thing ever guitar is not tuned of course best to have someone else tune it for you as the pitch pipe takes practice to actually use not exactly beginner friendly sounds just fine and feels durable,137,146
2913,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i just absolutely loved this guitar but if you are wanting lessons look here one of the best resources for courses is available at [ ] check out this awesome site for guitar players of any levels to get a href [ ] learn guitar tutorials have fun playing,49,147
2914,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,the guitar was as pictured and described a beginners guitar the ebook took a bit to reach me but i did get it,23,148
2915,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,first the strings was not tuned if u r a beginer how would you know how to tune them the strings r really thin which means they will pop when you do get it tuned i had so manyand downs with this gutair I am a beginner and i could not do nothing with this gutair all my freinds who have these big nice gutairs said this is a crappy gutair ohh it is falls out of tune in maybe a day or two srry but the only reason i got this gutair is because i did not know if i was going to stick with it now that I am advanced this gutair is for 3 year olds,114,149
2916,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i placed order for a christmas delivery for my son he has been very happy with it and is picking up the guitar better than i expected it has been a very good guitar for learning it was delivered before the promise date which was unexpected due to the fact that it was the week before christmas i would definately buy from them again,64,150
2917,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,to get my order i had to mail them so many times finally i got it but no comment because it is just looks like guitar while i was trying to fit it is string no more commentssssssssssssssss sender may know why i never will never buy any thing from amazoncom again,54,151
2918,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,it was great until i actually put the strings on maybe mine was the weakling of the bunch but the neck and bridge broke when i tuned the guitar well when i professional tuned it with the lightest strings on possible,42,152
2919,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,the guitar is great for what it is but i never received the instructional ebook so my granddaughter has not had a full experience with the instrument it came quickly and was packed well,33,153
2920,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,thewas not good like what i thought something wrong with the strings i could not use the,20,154
2921,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,got this for my 8 year old son for christmas he absolutely loved it has not had a lot of time to play it yet but my husband who is a guitar player tuned it for him and he started strumming immediately we also got him some cool rock guitar song books so I am sure he will be playing in no time it is nice that it comes with the bag and extra strings because one of the strings broke when my husband was tuning it my husband says it is common for strings to break and it happens all the time when he is playing so this is not a defect or knock on the quality my husband also said that it will sound a little twangy for a little while until the strings are broken in we almost bought a 30 guitar but i am glad we went with the bigger guitar because i think the 30 would have been too small for him and he is not a big child he will be able to play this for much longer than if we had purchased the smaller guitar very good purchase for the price,195,155
2922,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i am realtively new to online shopping and was very pleased with this experience the ease of the transaction the speed of the delivery i shop early and the satisfaction of the product purchased were all outstanding my son was thrilled with his new guitar and happy with everything that came with it hopefully with a proper carrying case we can avoid what happened to his first guitar purchased at an antique shop,73,156
2923,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,decent guitar for a beginner i would suggest changing the strings if you buy this guitar the ones provided are not of good quality with better strings you can get a good sound from it but i experienced some fret buzzing around the 10th and 11th fret on the 6th and 5th but other than that it is something good to buy for a beginner,63,157
2924,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this is a toy guitar no real guitar here awful smell no good termination no ebook either sounds terrible my fingers bleed when playing do not stay tuned carefull when buying this awful product yuk,34,158
2925,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,when the product arrived at first glance looked good all items were not in the shippment and come to find out this is not a real guitar it is a toy guitar do not be fooled on thinken you are getting a good deal it is a waste of your money,47,159
2926,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,i got my guitar and within the first 20 minutes i had broke the e and b strings while tuning it i just thought it was my inexperience so i took it to an experienced guitar player and the g string would not tune and broke while he tried we used the replacement strings to restring the whole guitar and tuned it but the d string still sounds dead and the g string still will not tune and he said he believes it is because the strings are cheap strings and it needs new better quality strings when we were trying to tune it we were using digital tuners not the pitch pipe that came with the guitar like i said the deal is a great one but not perfect the guitar is a good guitar but be prepared to have to buy better strings soon but do not expect top quality all the way around when only paying 20,159,160
2927,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,it arrived just on time and in good condition except that the guitar strings were not tight but it was good because i tightened it myself there was no ebook in it and the guitar had a little marks of dust or paint on it but it was not visible apart from that it was goodthanks,53,161
2928,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,this is not a full size guitar but a good starter one i bought this for my partner and she loves it,22,162

2930,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,I have got this guitar because it is really cheap and i have always been wanting one but i was really disappointed despite the cost of it it seriously look like a toy-guitar rather than a guitar I am just a beginner but the sound of it is really bad you are going to regret not spending a little more money and buying a real guitar,63,164
2931,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,this is without a doubt the biggest waste of hard earned that i have ever seen or heard i can not play anything on it have not decided if it is just cheap set of strings or it is just a worthless piece of junk i got it for someone else and imagine my embarrassment when she took it played it and out of it came the most horrible sound quality i have ever heard in my life the smaller jr guitars at walmart for 1200 have a better sound and tone quality again junk just sayin,94,165
2932,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,thisseems to be pretty good for the price my daughter 13 will be using it to take beginning guitar next semester at school her sister has a similarfrom the same company and it is working well so far the only issue i have is the fact that the case had mildew / mold upon arrival i tried to contact the company but they never responded fortunately after washing it by hand and then in the machine i was able to remove the offending substance,85,166
2933,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,i expected standard tuning knobs and fret inlays but the guitar i received had folk tuners and no inlays worse than that the guitar is not built properly the open strings can be tuned fine but the frets are not placed correctly and chords are completely out of tune,49,167
2934,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5.0,positive,i got this for my friend for christmas and she absolutely loved it,14,168
2935,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4.0,positive,my son loves his guitar it is very durable,9,169
2936,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2.0,negative,does not stay in tune for more than a day,9,170
2937,Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1.0,negative,crap do not even buy this it was bowed and it could not even be played i bought it as a starter guitar for my younger brother because i did not want to spend a lot of money if he did not pick it up it was garbage so he never played it bought him a more expensive one do not waste your money here,60,171
2938,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,excellent pedal i buy it to use as expression pedal for line6m5 and works perfectly for wah whammy volume and other crazy effects you can set the minimum level of each parameter and tension it is very comfortable of rugged construction and pedalboard friendly and i could get it for 80 dollars for me is the perfect expression pedal,60,0
2939,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,I have had this on my gigging board for over a year and I am really pleased with it this replaced my eb vice president jr which broke a string during a gig and in general i much prefer the dvp3 sound-wise i do not notice any difference in the swell rate but what i really like is the ability to adjust feel of the pedal and the added durability of not having a string the rubber tread started slipping off the treadle so i pulled it off and replaced it with grip tape maybe it does not look as cool but it is better than having a piece of rubber flapping around the only other thing I have noticed is that it started to squeak so i put a few drops of tri-flow around the center support of the hinge and it has been silent since after 10 years with various eb volume pedals I am not going back,152,1
2940,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,i bought this from another source at the same time i bought the boss fv-500h from amazon the boss pedal is huge by comparison the dvp3 is a much better size for me it takes up less floor space and is very stable even although they are both essentially the same pedal component wise to me the dvp3 sounded better with less tone suck of the two this one is my favorite for either volume control or expression I am back to buy another,83,2
2941,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,2.0,negative,the volume change from off to full volume is not very uniform at all for me it functions mostly like an on / off switch you can modify the taper for the expression output but not the volume output also it does not stay heel down by itself so using it to turn the volume completely off is difficult too shame because the pedal build and appearance is good and it looks like it is very sturdy i contacted dunlop about this and no response at all pedal is going in the garbage no more dunlop products for me,96,3
2942,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,i tried a morley wah / volume pedal before this one and did not like it this pedal offers a very smooth action and a lot of travel which the morley pedal did not have it is a passive pedal but i have not noticed any tone loss also the tension / resistance of the pedal can be adjusted the pedal seems to be very solid and well-built and seems like it could take a beating it is on the heavy side which i think is a good thing so it will not be sliding around overall I am very satisfied with this pedal and will buy again,101,4
2943,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,this pedal was great but with very little use failed i used it maybe 40 minutes and gently and it was done i would return it but by the time i used it is was past the return period 105 piece of junk,43,5
2944,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,lasted 10 minutes and broke amazingly cheap build quality,9,6
2945,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,be carefull buying this eventually the pot loose the grip so there s no way to keep the pedal in a stopped position the external adjustable screw does not fix that i opened and dissasembled it and let me tell you no replacements nor fixable parts inside so this pedal takes permanent damage the only replacemet aviable is buying another unit,61,7
2946,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,came basically broken the rocker was not strong enough to hold itself up and it had an ear-piercing squeakiness will not buy this again,24,8
2947,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1.0,negative,immediately lost tension on the internal hinge / pivot shaft and lost cc range foot pad just fllopped around and this is not associated with the external adjustable tension screw this is the 2 smaller allen lock bolts inside the pedal that pinch the main hinge shaft have opened twice to tighten those small allen lock bolts and it keeps happening even after reducing the external tension adjust to a minimum poor design have not even gotten to the frail mag strip this things a dog sad because it has a very comfortable throw and very useful features lighter weight and smaller footprint on the board as well against boss fv too bad,110,9
2948,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,i really like the adjustment for tension feature on this pedal it is constructed well has some weight to it and does not feel cheap at all i would definetely get another one if i needed another pedal,37,10
2949,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,seems to do what it need to do i feel like i want to tighten up the tension a bit as it is really almost too easy to make a change with your foot I have only used it for one show so far but I am sure it will perform as expected,50,11
2950,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,nice and smooth feel works great use it with a kemper,11,12
2951,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,this pedal is awesome i still have not used the exp output control i have a triple flashback tc electronics so I am planning on checking it out but overal a great volumne pedal no power required just plug in and go it also it is pedal-down resistance is adjustable which is one of my fav features along with a tuner outout big props,62,13
2952,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,what i expected after reading reviews decent pedal like the size and feel wish it was not passive,17,14
2953,Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,i like this pedal i did have it cut out on me once i like the possibility of using as an expression pedal that is why i bought it over the silver one it is nice and big it is better than the eb jr that douchebag ambient players use be a man and buy this,56,15
2954,Musical_Instruments,B00RJTXU3E,1.0,negative,for the same price plus a couple of dollars more you can get a totally metal one also it will not fit european for example behringer mic bottom screw mounts unless they are the longer threaded stems where the xlr cable connects but it was the cheap plastic that took me back avoid this one look at others what has more the pop screen connection appeared rather weak as well i returned mine to amazon and received a full refund,77,0
2955,Musical_Instruments,B00RJTXU3E,2.0,negative,a little too flimsy for my mic my at-2020 just weighed it down until i tightened the nuts the pop filter also sits a little too high,27,1
2956,Musical_Instruments,B00RJTXU3E,5.0,positive,exactly as advertised nothing fancy great shock-mount and filter,9,2
2957,Musical_Instruments,B00RJTXU3E,4.0,positive,the shock mount works great i was surprised my mic just screwed right into it but the pop filter does not fit so that it works for my at 20/20 mic,30,3
2958,Musical_Instruments,B00RJTXU3E,5.0,positive,superior workmanship and great price works well with mxl large diaphragm tube mic highly recommended,15,4
2959,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,i bought these for my wife they are defiantly not noise canceling not do they fit in your hear sound quality is average,23,0
2960,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,pros sound was good construction was decent easy to connect charger cable included cons would not stay in my ear had to push them in so hard that it hurt to wear them and they still fell out they allowed a lot of ambient noise pass-through did not provide much background noise attenuation could not connect them properly to my pc maybe a pc driver issue but do not have the time to mess around with it difficult to switch between bluetooth sources had to manually turn one off to connect to the other ie phone and pc,95,1
2961,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,bad experience with these they connected to my phone via bluetooth just fine but any movement caused them to cut in and out i disconnected and reconnected several times but the same result each time upon arrival one of the ear cushions was missing from the package so i had to scrounge up another one from another set of buds the ear pieces would not stay in place and fell out of my ears constantly i tried different sized cushions but it was the design and/or weight that caused the issue can not recommend these at all,96,2
2962,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,i would not purchase these again I have only used them three times and I have experienced problems each time i have static music breaking up even when phone is on my lap and headphones are charged another issue i am having is with the left ear piece the little rubber part which sticks into your ear falls off when not in use i have traded it out with another headphones part but it still seems to not fit i would recommend looking for another brand,84,3
2963,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,in case you only want reviews from people who have actually purchased theI am trying to figure out how to return them never felt the need to do that before one of the reasons that i purchased these headphone was they said they were also for running that is laughable they will not stay in your ears i got so angry at these things that i had to settle down a bit before i wrote this every other set of in ear headphones that i have purchased has has three different cup sizes and i have never had a problem with anything falling out of my ears neither side will stay in i was walking around thei am constructing and the sound went completely away i reached up and both were gone found them about ten feet in back of me maybe if itape them to another pair non-bluetooth,153,4
2964,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,these are not noise canceling the volume is just set at a very high level even at the lowest volume setting on my iphone it is pretty loud i could not raise the volume higher than 25 i had them on for 5 minutes and started to get a headache i like loud music but like the option to lower it to a soft level if needed even the female voice that announces the functions power on power off and more is very loud also the keyboard on my iphone would not function when connected to these earbuds i tested these with my ipad as well same issues with volume and keyboard,112,5
2965,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,worked great when i got it went to recharge it and will not recharge at all,15,6
2966,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,very bad very very bad th worst headphones used,9,7
2967,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,the fit is great the price is great but this thing seems to pick up disturbance and drops the signal a little too often listening to music on these speakers reminds me of the days when the cool kids had sony disc players with 5 sec skip protection and had to walk around like ninjas to prevent the music from skipping so long story short it seems to work ok but drops signals a lot also the cable is too long and has a rubberyness to it so it will slightly grip your skin if you turn your head the force of that grip may loosen thefrom your ear so you will have to adjust it often just getting a tie and looping the loose cable will be good enough to prevent this issue I had 100 buy again if the thing did not drop signal so much,148,8
2968,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,they lasted for 8 runs at first songs would skip then it would turn off i thought they were sweatproof apparently they are not,23,9
2969,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,these are extremely uncomfortable in the ear you should look at getting something different,14,10
2970,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,headphones really work great for the price i wear them when i work out and they stay in place,19,11
2971,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,i was not happy when i got this product because i was looking to exchange earbuds to remove ones that were on the device because they were too big i contact the seller it took multiple attempts for them to say they do not have them but the orginal product is avertised with plastic earbuds replacements,55,12
2972,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,they get a clear signal nice sound at first i really struggled to keep them in my ear but then i figured out the rubber piece above the ear-bud is supposed to secure into the upper part of your ear since then a great experience for a low cost,49,13
2973,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,the only earbuds that stay in my ears during my workout I am not too concerned with the quality of the sound but it seems to be pretty good i wish they would give you more of a warning when they need to be charged but other than that i love these,51,14
2974,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,I have been really impressed with this headset I have used these working out cycling and on the bus to work they have good range and excellent battery life they have lasted at least 5 hours in one use which is way more than i would expect,44,15
2975,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,works very good for me the battery charge works for about 3 hours it is nice to work in the gym,20,16
2976,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i received the headphones without one of the earbud pads they did send a new set to resolve this issue the headset is comfortable and i liked using it the problem i am having with the headphones is that they lose the bluetooth connection even during a call,48,17
2977,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,the best nc bluetooth headphones for the price notice i did not say the best headphones they do not cancel out much noise and the microphone is not as clear as higher end headphones also the range is pretty limited you do not want to be more than 10 feet from your phone or other device otherwise it will drop the connection that being said i would absolutely purchase these again they are good deal i have a very nice bose pair for flights with a lot of background noise and then this cheap pair for exercising and at the office,97,18
2978,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,headphones stopped working after 40 days which is 10 days after the return policy extremely frustrated would have been decent headphones for the price if they still worked i guess that is why they are cheap,35,19
2979,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,the device will not hold a charge also the proctor is too bulky it keeps falling out of ears with movement,21,20
2980,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,worked great at first but thrn got caught in the rain while running lost volume and none of the controls worked put it into a bag of rice in the sun and controls came back but now every time i sweat too much on a long run the controls on the chord short out and stop working can not even turn them off,61,21
2981,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,no bass the sound quality is poor the fit is uncomfortable i can turn the volume up to maximum and still no bass,23,22
2982,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i realize they are designed a little different from other bluetooth earbuds but these just barely work the sound is good although my phone recognizes them only as keyboard and i can not type anything with them connected they do fit my ears but it took quite a bit of work to get them to stay in and the little bit that sticks between the speaker and the outside makes it really awkward and does nothing to help overall i would not recommend them unless you want this very particular style they are just too awkward but are ok for cheap bluetooth earbuds if want better ones I had spend the little be extra to go aup which i plan to do when i can,124,23
2983,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,yes the included ear tips are too big for my ears no these are not audiophile quality fit was improved dramatically after spending about 10 seconds to remove the included tips and replace with some spares i had from another older pair of earphones 15 seconds back in ears and problem solved sound quality is certainly adequate i have not been able to get a tight enough seal to really drown out other sounds and get the deep bass of a good set of in-ear monitors but for walking around cord-free the sound is far better than some I have owned over the years and i have no complaints a few years ago you would have had to spend significant for this sound quality in a cordless headphone for less than 20 they are fantastic i can not comment yet on battery life as they have not died yet after probably about 4 hours of use over a few days pairing is a bit of a pain works fine with my iphone but my laptop seems to think it is a keyboard although it still works,183,24
2984,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i tried it the earphone buds they give you are pretty crappy so you will have to get new ones the batter life is crap so you will have to buy something else eventually or just do not plan on it replacing your current crappy device I am staring at mine right now just sitting there waiting to be thrown away i should not be biased at first it was great i plug them in charged them up almost wrote a great review but now i see them beeping that they have low power 20 times every 5 10 seconds during my music at the gym telling me in some phony voice about battery low it is great when they say power on and power off since it is helpful to know but it is like shut up i hear you the battery is low just be quiet and let me hear my music or my phone call but then they shut off so if you want to keep the battery at full forever then great but if they are used for backup or when you need them headphones buy new earbud covers and have an extra charger cord ready for i dunno whenever you need them battery life is not very good hope that helps,205,25
2985,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,good sound really easy to pair with the iphone 6 sometimes has issues with the volume level although it might be with my phone sometimes the volume is really quiet then i get a text message and it goes to really loud but it does not happen much and I am very happy overall with the headphone comfort and sound,58,26
2986,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,does not stay in your ear uncomfortable and painful to wear sound quality is okay,15,27
2987,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,this is perfect for running and i mean it it perfect it changes my keyboards i do not see predictive words when typing when paired with my phone galaxy s5 after i disconnect it everything goes back to normal i love this wireless headphone bluetooth,45,28
2988,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,wore these on an approximately 3 hour trip on my harley was not uncomfortable and i could hear them just fine over my bike at 70 mph,26,29
2989,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,for the price these are certainly a great deal the sound is clear the reception is good and the noise cancelling is good enough that i was able to hear my music clearly even riding on a motorbike on the highway my only complaint is that they do not stay in my ears they come with multiple earbud sizes and I have tried them all but even the one that fits the best still tends to fall out a little too often but again for the price i can not complain,89,30
2990,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,disappointed it is fine if i stay in the same room but do not go to the next room at this price although what else should i expect you get what you pay for as the old saying goes,37,31
2991,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,awful they fall out constantly and are huge,8,32
2992,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,pros bluetooth setup quick and easy uses standard micro usb cable for charging included cons comes with only one set of earpieces so if they are not a good fit for you you are out of luck sound is mediocre at best volume control is flakey inconsistent they work sometimes but usually do not charging port cover is flimsy and tough to open with a fingernail even with the earpiece fully in your ear the rest of the earphone body sticks out of your ear by nearly an inch i think this is primarily why they will not stay in your ears too much leverage would not recommend poor ergonomics very low quality even for 20,117,33
2993,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,so far these earphones arnt the best their kinda bulky and it is not a clear sound at all the base is not great either also they kinda hurt you are ears after a while but i mean 20 is kinda a lot but i would have rather invested in a better pair anyways good luck,53,34
2994,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,product is garbage for a product that you are supposed to be able to run in i could not even turn my head without falling from position i never write reviews but this was so bad i had to do not get caught up in price thought i was getting good deal at 20 they are not worth 20 cents,57,35
2995,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,this earphones are the best i just got them today and if the earbuds are to big you can change them,21,36
2996,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,good for listening to music not good for watching videos or movies do to delay,15,37
2997,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for cheap quality sound does not get very loud and they slip out of the ears easily when working out,24,38
2998,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,i use them riding my bicycle they cut out every time i turn my head,15,39
2999,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,sound great especially for being bluetooth super affordable for workout earphones they stayed in pretty well when i ran but it was a bit bulky on the actual earbuds overall it is a great set of headphones as a backup and for doing activities i will definitely be looking into more bluetooth headphones that would look nicer for more business-like events i love these although i also received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review,78,40
3000,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,these earbuds are pretty comfortable to wear they are very stable in my ears and does not fall out by themselves pairing it through bluetooth was easy and i did not encounter any problems the design of these earbuds are similar to a lot of other bluetooth earbuds i really like the little droplet design the added to them but thescheme is a bit dull for me sound quality on these earbuds are pretty good i do not expect them to be the best since they are bluetooth but these are pretty do able overall pretty good bluetooth headphones i received this in exchange for a honest review,106,41
3001,Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,great deal for the price i get about 45hrs of music listening charge,14,42
3002,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,2.0,negative,do not know about the quality it was dead out of the box returned it as defective,15,0
3003,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these for purposes of skype when gaming microphone 1 was basically dead on arrival would only record the faintest of sound no matter how close i was to microphone or how loud i spoke i spent waaay too much time trying to troubleshoot the problem including double-checking sound card drivers and more before just trying microphone 2 well did not i feel dumb when 2 worked just fine anyway my results with a very limited sample size is equivalent to a coin flip 2 bought i dead 1 works fine 50/50 not good enough for me i would not recommend this product as a side-note i paid for next day shipping on these it took7 days to deliver them to me they changed their delivery date 4 times what a waste not amazons fault i live 9 miles from the biggest socal amazon distribution center,148,1
3004,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4.0,positive,i ended up returning this microphone although it was easy to use and good quality i bought it to add voiceover to videos but i did not hear much difference in quality between using this microphone and just using an app on my iphone,43,2
3005,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,5.0,positive,received the microphone just as pictured did just as it says plug in and go fast shipment very satisfied a to the seller,24,3
3006,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,5.0,positive,good for what it is not a high quality mic but a good one for podcasting and for what i use it for voice overs,25,4
3007,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,5.0,positive,this microphone is pretty good i used it to stream resident evil 7 haha i recommend it the wire is about 3 to 4 feet long so make sure you accommodate that,32,5
3008,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4.0,positive,overall voice pickup is good but has a slight background hum for those with exceptionally good hearing,17,6
3009,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for my sennheiser game one headset mic is prob 2x better,16,7

3013,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,5.0,positive,for the price it is very good before purchasing this one i had bought another 10 microphone that was not worth even that bad quality and broke after six months this one has been far superior use it with skype chatting while playing multiplayer games and basic voice recording stuff my kids use it to record let us play videos and when they play minecraft multiplayer and they love it,67,11
3014,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,I am pretty disappointed with this product i bought this for my child who loves to sing the minute we got it we plugged it in and it does not even work i threw the packaging away so i was not able to return it this microphone was a really big disappointment,49,12
3015,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,2.0,negative,i do not know why every time i try to record with this mic on my mac it does not allow me only on imovie and even in that app it keeps making a weird noise in the back ground it work good for the first 5 mins and then i do not know what happen to it,55,13
3016,Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4.0,positive,seems to work fine for me so far,8,14

3021,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5.0,positive,corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason and more this is one of the few corded phones with caller identification and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless and more also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house,99,1

3026,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this is a good phone that works well the thing to be aware of is the feature buttons like ringer on are all on top if you put the phone on the wall you can not see the buttons and what they are meant for i use the ringer on / off button a lot and i had to write with a marker on the front of the phone where the ringer button is,71,6
3027,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,to me this phone needs to be off the market i have had more problems with each phone i recieved,20,7
3028,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this is my second easytouch ii i like the easy to read caller identification with option to call back once the identification is in the memory large easy to use buttons and speaker feature so i do not have to pick up the receiver if I am working on my pc,49,8
3029,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,phone did not work at all first of all the seller did not send the ac adapter i had to order it then when it came the phone did not work at all the only thing that worked was the caller identification and that is the only reason why i gave it 1 star,54,9
3030,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5.0,positive,easy to set up and works fine would buy again recommended to several of my friends especially those with hearing problems,22,10
3031,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,i bought this so i could have a hard line for a storm i also bought it for the speaker phone and it is terrible this is a great phone if you do not mind holding it up to your ear but for the speaker phone it is horrible,48,11
3032,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,the product looks ok the buttons are nice and big and easy to read they do not work very well although for example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often i have to press it several times and just right for it to work it does not come with the ac adapter and northwestern bell no longer makes or distributes them without the adapter the lights do not work including the message waiting light it is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter i have tried several stores such as radio shack best buy walmart and target to find an adapter 120vac to 6v 100ma and can not find one i have not been able to find one online either also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 aa batteries it does not this one takes 4 aaa batteries not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me but the description is not accurate for thei am sending it back,187,12
3033,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this phone is very good for the price i bought this phone for someone else this is the 2nd time I have bought this phone the first time i bought this phone it was 3999 in staples everyone should have a corded phone as a back up if the power fails or power failure in your home the manufacture has this phone listed as white but the phone is a beige that is the only fault I have found with this phone,79,13
3034,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,this phone has no mute button which made it absolutely useless for the application intended i would not recommend if you need this option otherwise the phone was very nice,30,14
3035,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4.0,positive,phone works fine i like the one touch memory buttons they would be better if there was more room to put name on each button,25,15
3036,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,somehow i had the impression that the phone had a message waiting led indicator but what they do not tell you is that the same led is used to indicate missed calls which to me makes the led totally worthless the phone i had before used the same light but it flashed green for missed calls and flashed red if there was a message waiting this phone makes no distinction between the two i had plugged the phone into a phone line just to see how it operated i never even got so far as to hang the phone on the wall before judging the message waiting issue because for stuffing the phone back into the box,118,16
3037,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,after shopping around for a standard phone with callerid and no answering machine no power outlet nearby i came across this phone that had good ratings and was reasonably priced i like the look and feel of the phone the buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good however when the unit is wall mounted the lcd display is angled down and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it of course that depends on how high your phone jack is and how tall you are i bought two of these phones and both locations i put them were too low to see without crouching down the other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well i do not know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference i could not try that because the unit did not come with an ac adapter plus i have no power outlet close enough to reach so i had to take both phones down and put our 15 year old ones back up,191,17
3038,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2.0,negative,i actually like the phone quite a bit it works pretty well in almost every regard sound quality is very good buttons are easy to find and use and the feature set is pretty good overall a nice phone and a good value however thisis advertised as having 20 number memory which is 10 one touch and 10 two touch i have not been able to get the two touch feature to work i tried calling the customer support number i could never get an answer i was always put on a queue waited for a couple of minutes and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call i left messages and never got a call back i twice tried recalling immediately after getting booted i tried for an hour no joy do not buy northwestern bell phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong,149,18
3039,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1.0,negative,this is a real lemon the volume does not work properly and distorts the sound the touchtone keys stick even although i have had this phone less than 6 months i would like my money back,36,19
3040,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i was ripped off by amazons splitting shipping charges after i had ordered the tiesm as a group i was charged 3 shipping charges for 1 mechanical pencil and 2 orders ofrefills total value of product 1035 total shipping 2003 1 pencil 775 s h 505 190 s h 998 2 leads 170 s h 600 outrageous when i tried to cancel the order after it had been split up i was told it was too late never again,81,0

3042,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,thedoes erase well if you use fine quality paper it does not erase well on cheap paper i suggest if you are using these to sketch you use moleskine sketchbooks which use a heavier paper than most brands i use thisa lot and i mean a lot when i sketch it is helpful when i am laying down a foundation for character work in my sketchbook now that i own it i can not see myself not using it i can not believe more brands are not mimicking thislead thing i was able to find blue pentellon another site i wish amazon carried it,110,2
3043,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,theis nice but thedoes not write dark enough nor does it erase easily,16,3
3044,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,hard to draw with since it keeps breaking just stick with yourpencils kitties,15,4
3045,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i was expecting this to be exactly like the blackrefills only in red unfortunately it is not the same quality as the blackrefills and breaks very easily i found the constant breaking frustrating and gave up using it i would not buy this product again,48,5
3046,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i disliked this product because it does not erase completely and it is pointless since i wanted to use this in my math class,22,6
3047,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,received the wrongi received 07 mm instead of 05 mm,10,7
3048,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,the kids were so tickled especially our youngest to get this product they really love theof havingthat is ait works well but the novelty effect for children is even better than the product itself,39,8
3049,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,thisis uselessit snaps way too easily and it is impossible to erase do not waste your money,17,9
3050,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i mean i got what i asked for when i bought red pencili got red pencili did not however expect such weak quality it is difficult to use for what i intended it for I am disappointed i can not apply too much pressure or it will snap which means i do not get as strong aas i was hoping for,62,10
3051,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,easy broken colour is light and broke easily,8,11
3052,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,breaks at any pressure applied to the paper,8,12
3053,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,neatbutis so soft i could not write with it at all it kept breaking thewas not very dark either great service although,26,13
3054,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i write a lot with thisit is impossible it breaks all the time do not waste your time or money if you find a solid 05lead please let me know otherwise you jump to 07 and then 2,42,14
3055,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,no smog on paper note make sure you have a good eraser although or be proficient in an adobe ps,20,15
3056,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,use thiswith my pentel graphgear 1000 drafting pencil to mark up plans,14,16
3057,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i tried thisabout 15 years ago and it was terrible i tried it again recently and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be firstly theis very light inyou can barely see it when writing on white paper it is really more of a light pink than a red as well secondly theis very brittle it breaks constantly even when writing with a light touch i can barely write a few lines without a breakage given this fact i do not think thisis useful for anything more than making check marks on papers i certainly can not do any serious writing with it lastly it feels very strange to write with it granted it is not a graphitethe feel is still unusual like trying to write with something made of wax if thiswere not so brittle and light init might be worthwhile but alas i simply can not use it,170,17
3058,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,just got it today so i decided to try it out first off i bought this to sketch with i see many reviews on this product saying it breaks too easily from what i can tell it does not break that easily as far as the lines on paper i can sort of compare it to colored pencil like but not necessarily overall i like this product and i am very glad i bought it,74,18
3059,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,very cheap breaks easily dony bother putting it in through the tip because it shall peel and erases terribly do not waste your money,22,19
3060,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,it is really nice being able to use a fine point mechanical pencil to mark up blueprints all although they do not erase well at all,25,20
3061,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,breaks constantly so much so that is it not useable,9,21
3062,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,i use them for design drawing markups red-pencils are bolder so i keep those handy these allow me to make finer detailed notations it is true that theis softer than black leads but as long as you are gentle enough they work just fine i put a red-band of fingernail polish on my pencil so that i know which one has the red leads in it,66,22
3063,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,breaks at the slightest pressure poor quality,8,23
3064,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,not brightnot good for writing at all eraser can not remove this pencil so it is pretty much the same as ball-point pen not what i expected,27,24
3065,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,thebreaks very easily however I am able to get a good range of values for sketching and it is really fun to use coloreddefinitely pick it up for the price of it,34,25
3066,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,we use these in our inspection pencils and they are just what you expect,14,26
3067,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,there is no such thing as redour pencilis actually graphite which can not be red sadly as it is a form of carbon cc this is actually very thin wax the same kind found inpencils i love this it pairs off with the 5 steadler pencil i received as a gift nicely it is not too brittle to the point that it breaks on contact you must be soft with it and use many layers one thing i learned is that you should only use about 1 mm or 2 mm ofat a time coming out of the pencil I have attached some photos of my doodles i do at work while combing thiswith graphite and sumi ink respectively,126,27
3068,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,they break fairly easily but that is no indication of poor quality it is just the nature of coloredgo with 07 mm for colored leads it is much more durable,29,28
3069,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,too fragile press hard enough to see the writing and they break,12,29
3070,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,use these a lot for sketching very smooth and easy to use,12,30
3071,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,thebreaks easily when using a steel mechanical pencil only use in a plastic one if you do not want it to break every stroke,25,31
3072,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,good product but breaks easily going back to regular red pencils,11,32
3073,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,these break if you even look at them,8,33
3074,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,it is cool that it is mechanical and red it makes ticking work easy thebreaks so often although it is barely worth even trying,26,34
3075,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,this is basically just led removed from a colored pencil and coined for writing works very poorly less effective than simply writing with a colored pencil to begin with,29,35
3076,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,i work as an intern for a construction company and to make corrections to drawings we use red pencil and this works perfectly in my pentel 1000 graphgear pencil however if too much force is used while writing thetends to break quite often other than that this stuff works great,52,36
3077,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,theis very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks it is not a dark red and can be hard to see if not using on white paper it does not erase easily but you can erase it if you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light inand fragile than this is your pick i can not really say i have tried others,71,37
3078,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,i homeschool and was going through red pens like mad decided a pencil would be cheaper and work better so ordered these they work fine but the next time I shall probably try to get them for my 09 pencil the 05requires that you write lightly and to get red pencils to really show on students papers you have to press a little harder than normal,67,38
3079,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,this product is exactly what i ordered and it arrived quickly thebreaks easily but is expected out of red 05 mm,23,39
3080,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,thisis very soft and will break on a regular basis theis very light if you try to reduce the amount of pressure you use,28,40
3081,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,like most i wanted to have a second mech pencil with redfor markup i do not know how hard some reviewers stroke is but these work fine for me with no breakage yet even pressing hard however they are more waxy than blackso when pressing hard they do wear quickly and they do erase but not nearly as readily as normal blackas tothese are red not pantone whatever maybe they are a shade of pink but they are red as distinguishable from black which is all i think they are meant to be,101,41
3082,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i am a teacher and was hoping to use these for grading since i prefer writing with a pencil these did not work out at all for me thebreaks every few minutes annoying i will try a thicker gauge,41,42
3083,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,i can certainly would like use good colored auto pencils to underline my bible and supplement my drawing pads but i found this redto be a little light when drawing and i had to press harder so i like the concept but please make something with more ease of drawing and deeper,55,43
3084,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,thewas not red but a light pink thewas hard and scratchy i could neot even see the lines unless i used heavy pressure,27,44
3085,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4.0,positive,took kind of a while to arrive it is a fine pentel product some people has complained it breaks easily and it does break easier than regularbut I am sure it is difficult to make coloredas hard as regular i press really hard when i write so i just had to be mindful and it was fine,58,45
3086,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5.0,positive,if you have to red line or correct tests homework or mechanical drawings this is what you want to use it produces a fine accurate line for any 05 mm mechanical pencil once your peers see your handiwork they will all be asking you for a piece of red led for their correcting pencil it can not be erased like a pen so it is pretty much tamper proof red marking,68,46
3087,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1.0,negative,i bought the redfor correcting papers but it has proven useless theis very soft and crumbles easily while writing the crumbling is especially a pain when revising papers because i think i tend to press harder while correcting small detailed text features also theis too light and compared to regularthere is no advantage it also does not erase so clearly i wish i had not bought this especially so much of it,79,47
3088,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2.0,negative,thisis very soft if you push out more than a millimeter it breaks i find i can not use thiswithout feeling the metal of the pencil scraping the paper if you advance it any further thebreaks very disappointing product,44,48
3103,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,they look good and they are relatively thick unfortunately they are extremely flimsy further the adhesive squares included for hanging them did not stick to the cork panels unfortunately they did continue sticking to my walls once the cork panels fell off now all i have is a bunch of broken cork panels they broke when they fell and numerous adhesive squares i have to pry / scrape / steam off my wall might have worked better if I had hammered them in place too late now i do not recommend this,86,0
3104,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,when these arrived they were moldy smelling and crumbled apart waste of money,13,1
3105,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,so these get very mixed reviews but there has a simple way to make them great i noticed another reviewer suggested using mod podge to seal them before use do it just get the matte version gloss does not look good and get your own mounting tape what comes with them is not great but the best part of these is the unique look and thickness of the tiles they are much thicker than others i did something a little different after i used the mod podge i drilled into the cork and hung them on door / wreath hangers see picture works fantastic i really really like these tiles,104,2
3106,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,great boards but tape that comes with it does not work well buy your own tape for wall hanging,18,3
3107,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,this product comes with adhesive strips to hold them in place i would have preferred that the adhesive had bee a bit more substantial there was enough double sided tape to put a 1 x 1 patch of tape on each corner more would have been better,47,4
3108,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,redid my wall with these tiles and it looks great the old tiles were falling apart,16,5
3109,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,a lot came damaged or uneven some squares were off almost an inch so they could not be used,18,6
3110,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,the cork in the two different packages did not match and it was impossible to stick this to the wall a disaster,22,7
3111,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,love thebut sticky wall tabs do not keep boards mounted i needed to nail them on,18,8
3112,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,horrible product the first thing i noticed when opening the package was a strong horrible chemical smell i thought it would subside after airing out but after a week it never did the dye on the boards comes off easily and the material is very crumbly,46,9
3113,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,using for bulletin board on the side of my stainless steel frig i had to ditch the magnets works well,20,10
3114,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,we received two sets of these cork boards the second set was clearly a return two of the tiles had stickies on the back making them stick together and break and one actually had a thumb tack stuck in it completely unusable i would like a replacement sent as soon as possible thank you,51,11
3115,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,this board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles 4-pack 82va-4 this corkboard is wonderful i did not use the stickies that came with it i actually attached it to an old window it turned out great you have to use something like scissors to cut it heavy duty ones not a knife or carpet cutter or something like that so i used a pair of tin snips it worked great cut a straight line and the pieces fit neatly into the space of the window panes but the kicker is i used gorilla glue the one where you dampen one of the surfaces i dampened the cork it worked beautifully and now i have a really cool bulletin board for my new office adding to the industrial chic decor already there love love love,139,12
3116,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i love these cork tiles the darklooks great on my light walls and i like how thick they are compared to other corkboards i have tried in the past i put them on the walls around my desk at home to hold pictures / papers i used the enclosed sticky back tabs to put them up in sept 2013 and they are holding strong never had an issue with them coming off i also used an exacto knife to cut them to the size i wanted highly recommend,89,13
3117,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the board did not stick to the tape provided maybe i used the wrong side,15,14
3118,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i really do not like these they crumble and they are all very different tones so they do not create a seamless wall,21,15
3119,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,we ordered a six sets of these for a clients home office and used the sticky foam the came with the items to install we wiped down the wall and then applied the cork to ensure the best stick after being up for just a week the client reported that literally every single piece had fallen down she tried repeatedly to re-stick them and finally used a few heavy duty command strips which finally worked for a few we unfortunately bought these a couple months before installing them and so we can no longer return them I have used these types of cork boards before with little trouble but this was just plain embarrassing we now are having to refund our client and install traditionally framed cork boards instead beware when buying this product that the sticky pads are not great quality and a huge hassle to work what the heck and apparently do not stick to all wall types,156,16
3120,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,very nice i use them on my wall by my desk and on the fridge,15,17
3121,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,when i received the cork squares i mounted them they did not stick well and fell off the surface when i tried to work with them to resecure they fell apart and breaking,32,18
3122,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,cork tiles are great however the sticky tabs do not hold the cork side they stuck to the wall but the cork side is not holding,26,19
3123,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i can see how these could potentially break apart they look pretty fragile but as i was covering these with fabric attached with spray adhesive they are just perfect for my new corkboard i especially love that they are 1/4 inch thick thicker than most cork tiles i found on amazon because most push pins are 1/4 long and i did not want to poke through to the wall,68,20
3124,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,i bought these to cover with fabric when they arrived one was already torn most of the way across they seemed to crumble as i worked with them and there was a big mess on the floor when i was done I have worked with other cork tiles before and did not have this problem,54,21
3125,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,love these i have put them up in my office the best part they smell like smoked brisket laughing out loud,19,22
3126,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,bigger than i expected using to bring more life into a room,12,23
3127,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,they are nice cork boards but have a strong oder to them like liquid smoke i hope it wears off quickly if it does not it will be the first purchase from amazoncom that i throw away three days later and two nights of feeling sick from the oder even after spraying them with a vinegar water mix that was suppose to help i had to throw them away plus i now have to go buy something to repair the wall from hanging them with the stickies they come with what a waste of money bummed,95,24
3128,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,as many of the other recent reviewers stated this is too crumbly to be useful they are also thicker than other cork tiles on this site so i thought furniture tacks would work to put them up but they were too thick i tried nailing them in which is when the office became a gross cork fest waste of money and it is a shame they are really cute in the trash they go,73,25
3129,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these do not stick no matter how many sticky squares i use the boards also crumble easily and they smell bad i wanted to hang these on the inside of my pantry cabinet door and they have been a useless disaster if i had the packaging still I had return them,50,26
3130,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,unfortunately these arrived moldy under the plastic wrapping i had to return them re-purchased a similar product at the hardware store instead which cost me a bit more but they work fine this kind of cork can have a pretty strong smell although be forewarned i kind of like it but not everyone will,54,27
3131,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,they are a greatfor my espresso wood in the office however they are a little messy they leave crumbs if you touch the side i think it is due to how big the pieces of cork are not a huge deal once they are put up if you do not take things on and off much,54,28
3132,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,have not yet put them up but they look like exactly what i wanted,14,29
3133,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,first off i was excited at the possibilities of making my own design on my wall with these cork boards that is where the excitement ended first off they smell terrible I have washed my hands twice after hanging them and my hands still smell bad I am hoping my room does not continue to smell otherwise I am going to have to remove them completely i ordered 2 packages of 4 tiles i could only use 4 tiles as 3 of them broke they are very fragile do not hold them on the corners simple gravity will make them snap in half i accidently broke 2 just by holding them on the corners and their own weight caused them to crumble the other one i held in the middle and it still broke in half they also bring a ton of cork dust when assembling simply put they are very poorly made,148,30
3134,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,love the boards but the stick tabs do not hold these up i had to put nails in each one,20,31
3135,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,we purchased these to protect the wall behind our dart board they work fine for this purpose however if you were going to use for posting things on a bulletin board they may not stand up to everyday use,39,32
3136,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i applied to a regular eggshell paint finish and the tiles fell off of course i did not buy heavy duty tape the whole thing just went straight into the trash and i have some of the tape still stuck on my walls,42,33
3137,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the cork crumbles it is pretty messy does not completely fall apart but chips easily very flimsy too,16,34
3138,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i am making several different things and gluing these to them then using left over to make a cork board,20,35
3139,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,look good but do not stay stuck to wall and crumble apart easy,12,36
3140,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i ordered this product to create usable space on an indoor window not subject to temperature changes the pieces were difficult to make a clean cut even with a new blade in the mat knife and within 48 hours after applying the cork squares they began to fall off of their adhesive attachment tape leaving squares of very difficult to remove white tape a real pain in the at,69,37
3141,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,love the board and the price for the pack but the sticky backs that come with it do not work for beans,21,38
3142,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,did the whole ceiling in my office with these now it looks good smells good and is much quieter,18,39
3143,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,very poor quality and very crumbly we could not use them in our office big disappointment,16,40
3144,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i have to rewrite my review i gave this product more stars in the beginning the sticky pieces wldnt work so i tried gluing the adhesive to the back of the boards i used two sets and put all 8 pieces together within a week the adhesive pieces on the top part of the cork came loose the cork started breaking in half and my childrens artwork fell while i was gone i had caught it a couple times when i was home and was able to stop the cork from breaking those times i wld not recommended this product the cork is not thick enough and even adding 3 m adhesives did not keep it on the wall waste of my money i will have to purchase something else,128,41
3145,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these boards are extremely difficult to hang i have tried several different types of hanging / mounting strips and nothing works in addition the mounting strips have stripped paint off my walls i am not even posting anything heavy just my childs artwork these have created a much bigger headache for me than they were worth,54,42
3146,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,provided tape does not holdto the wall used command strips instead crumbles very easily,16,43
3147,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,terrible cheap and they were all on the floor the next day,12,44
3148,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,poor quality cork board if it is not already broken upon arrival it will be once you try hanging with the adhesive pads that the cork comes right off of walking into my office the morning after hanging them i discovered all but one had peeled away from the supplied adhesive strips the last one was about to fall and two of the other three no had large chunks broken off due to impact with the floor do not waste your time patience or money on this product,86,45
3149,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these are terrible bought them to go behind an electronic dart board game greatbut after putting them up the next day they had all fallen from the wall and broken double-sided tape did not hold up on clean / painted wall also the boards were covered in what appeared to be some sort of white mildew inside the shrink-wrap terrible product do not do it,64,46
3150,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,bought these to go under plants on side tables in order to protect the wood perfect for that purpose thin enough to cut easily and dark enough not to stand out on my dark wood tables,36,47
3151,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i do agree that these are a bit crumbly but if you are careful with them it is not really that big a deal it is simply a side effect of the material they are made of they left a few crumbs out of the package but now that they are on the wall i do not see any problem and they look very rich with the darker colouring as opposed to the usual more bland corkboard squares you can buy i also did not use the adhesive that was in the packet with the squares i used command strips instead both because I am in a rental flat and also because i just wanted to give the cork squares a solid foundation they look great I had buy them again,124,48
3152,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,horrible crumbles with the slightest touch spent nearly 100 for 24 tiles and now have to replace with another product would rate lower if possible,25,49
3153,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,if i could rate these 20 i would i ended up just throwing them away i opened my package and they started falling apart on me i literally had cork all over the place after taking them out of the plastic i did not want something that was going to disintegrate horrible product do not waste your money,56,50
3154,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,these pretty much starting falling apart as soon as i unwrapped them and they left a mess on my kitchen table they are not exactly what i was expecting and probably will not work for what i wanted to use them for which is an aesthetic protective covering for a coffee table i will likely shop around for something mre suitable,59,51
3155,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the cork boards are fine but the tape to attach them was old and dried out,16,52
3156,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,adhesive stuck to the wall just fine but not to the actual cork and they kept falling off the wall and broke into pieces,24,53
3157,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,you are going to need some super glue to really get the stickers to stick to the cork board once you do that these boards will stick to the wall just fine if you do not use glue the double sided tape that comes with it will not stick to the cork board not for long at least,56,54
3158,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,unfortunately these cork tiles crumble at any touch very messy and unable to be used as a bulletin board you only end up with cork dust,26,55
3159,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i was skeptical about ordering these after reading other reviews i should have listened to what i read these are horrible quality just taking them out of the wrapping they completely fell apart i hung a few of the tiles and every time i pin something to them brown cork dust falls everywhere just disgusting and completely not worth the price do not order these,65,56
3160,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,order one batch of 4 like them then ordered 2 more for a total of 12 individual boards the first four were every so slightly lighter than the 2nd batch so i just intermingled them when installing to make it look intentional the 4 pieces of double sided tape enclosed is not close to being enough mounting hardware even the instructions said to use 6 at a minimum i bought some heavy duty double sided mounting tape from big box retailer and used about 20 1 squares of double sided tape per board any less and the board may still stick to the wall but the parts without the tape were loose and easy to bump and break off especially if the boards are actually used and not just on the wall as a decoration the additional tape was especially important since this went behind a dart board so pulling darts out with the minimal mounting tape would likely have left me with many damaged and broken boards the boards themselves are very nice and do look very nice too so it still gets 4 stars for that but loses a star for the lack of proper mounting material,199,57
3161,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,would not recommend right out of the package this was a crumbly mess i wanted that cool look of spacing cork tiles out for pinning and more not the right thing for that i have it stuffed up on a shelf now should probably toss it out before it stays up there for three years getting dusty and making clutter,59,58
3162,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,i ordered the dark cork tiles in two batches they were significantly different inhence they did not match as i expected them to,25,59
3163,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the included double side tapes are not sufficient to make the cork stay on the walls plan on making them stay a different way,24,60
3164,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,fell off wall in less than 2 wks and all the cork chipped at corners the cork is pretty although just does not stick with provided adhesive,26,61
3165,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i bought these for my sons room but i will not use them they are going in the trash when i first opened the package the smell was so strong that i had to leave them in the garage i had hoped that the smell would go away but after a week in our garage they are not much better then on the day they were opened,66,62
3166,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,a little flimsy and crumbly but overall I am satisfied with these lil guys this darker brownwas a little harder to find than the standard cork and the material is a little different too as you can tell from the picture it is not a smooth roll of corkboard or anything it is more like a bunch of little chunks formed together which i think gives it kind of a neat textured look unlike a lot of other ones i looked at these are a nice thickness making them suitable to use alone with push-pins they did make a mess when i put them up and I am not sure how well they would stand up to being taken down and remounted but oh well still worth it oh i also attached them with tiny nails instead of even bothering with the adhesive squares,143,63
3167,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,these squares are a nicesturdy and look nice the major issue is there are not enough adhesive squares included with the package the instructions clearly state that 6 adhesive squares allow for the best bond to the surface but only include enough for four per square sadly i already posted items on the board only to have two of the squares fall off within an hour perhaps if i had enough adhesive squares this would not have happened,79,64
3168,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,good size and easy to work with in terms of application and fit definitely recommend for a variety of crafting projects,21,65
3169,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,most places sell much thinner cork than what i needed this i actually use as protective backing for the wall surrounding a metal tip dartboard works great for that purpose,30,66
3170,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,these boards were easy to put up on the wall with some double sided tape the heavy duty kind so far they are still on the wall the thickness of the boards are perfect for utilizing them as a bulletin board i love theof them too,48,67
3171,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,the board dudes 12 x 12 dark cork tiles are thicker than many of the lighter cork tiles i found in stores the texture andis perfect too,29,68
3172,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,i ordered two packs one arrived crumbling and looked totally different as if it had not been pressed enough i returned it thinking it was a fluke and was quickly shipped a replacement which had two tiles with broken corners i sent them all back they are very nice looking cork boards thick and a nice darkbut go to the store to buy them so you can make sure they are undamaged and all match,77,69
3173,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,the cork certainly looks like it could become crumbly if over-manipulated which makes the fact that they arrived all 4 sheets in perfect condition all the more impressive their corners were squared and no chips or holes i cut them to size with a razor blade and puzzled them together around the bar section of my apartments walls really adds some much needed comfort to these white walls looks professional and fantastic the provided sticky tabs are working for me at the moment but if they do start to slip it is no chore whatsoever to hammer in some little nails the surface is somewhat porous meaning little nails would be completely invisible if positioned tactfully fair value for the buck which is becoming a rarity these days,127,70
3174,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,my daughter and i painted them purple and black and made a decorative bulletin board with them the students love it,21,71
3175,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i used this to fill an old window frame to use as a tack board works greats it does have a tendency to crumble when cutting use a very sharp blade and go slow,33,72
3176,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the product leaves crumbs or bits tends to fall apart the more you use it does not hold push pins well,20,73
3177,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i bought these to maybe use for an earring hanger but I am not positive anymore the four cork tiles are pretty thick and theis nice and dark it is however flaking a bit like piece of the cork are coming off like a lot of pieces they are still intact and will still be usable they are just leaving a trail wherever i take them,66,74
3178,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,this stuff seems to be the right thickness to go behind my dart board and give the sheet rock a rest two packs did the trick three squares above three below and one on either side the mounting system of my bandit dart board still fits perfectly even although the edges of the dart board are over some of the cork it comes with a bunch of double sided tape squares i only used one in each corner just to get the squares set and then used a few finishing nails for more strength all of this and it has a pleasant smokey scent,104,75
3179,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,I am making a largewall in my office and gluing this onto corrugated plastic panels which will be attached to the wall the highly inadequate adhesive squares are completely pointless as i want this stuff to stay attached to the wall for more than a day and the sheetrocked walls in my office have some texture I am using contact cement the edges of these squares are easy to damage and the detritus they she had is non stop i only hope once i have it mounted and framed it with molding it will cease to she had so many cork crumbs i gave it 2 stars because I am committed to finishing my project i do not like it i may hate it in the end and have to revisit and change my review,131,76
3180,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,the product is crumbly but worse all the tiles fell down and no i have sticky double sided tape on my wall i can not get off,26,77
3181,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,it was a little messy as others have said but not overly so i used it on a floor that does not get much traffic a half bath but it was down in a day and looks good I have had it down for about a month and is holding up so far theis great and the thickness is perfect i had little cork pieces everywhere when i cut it but it cut well i thought and a few minutes with a vacuum and voila i like it,89,78
3182,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,glue patches too small tend to stick on wall but not on the more open tile many failed to adhrere,20,79
3183,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i built a picture frame and cut these out and glued them in works great to pin up pictures it looks great and works perfectly,24,80
3184,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i had been searching all over for the correctand density to replace some old broken cork tiles on my daughters cork wall this was an exact match if the previous tiles are any indication of the durability of these tiles they will last quite some time the current ones have been up for i know over 12 years,60,81
3185,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,they do not hang with adhesives provided so i used command strips they are kind of curved but that is only obvious if you hang it curving away from the wall they are very delicate if you drop them they will probably fall into pieces be very careful when handling these on a positive note theis very unique and expensive-looking it adds an artsy element to my room i use it to hang my jewelry and it keeps it very organized I have had them for a few months and so far they are still intact it is a great price so do not expect too much handle with care,107,82
3186,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,these cork tiles are a good thickness but they are very crumbly the consistency of the cork is much looser than that of a typical cork board i would love to find good quality dark cork but this is not it,40,83
3187,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,my delivery never showed up not sure if the company or the mailman is to blame but there is no tracking information available when you purchase this product the seller did resend me the items after i called to follow up about a week later if you need them as soon as possible bewarewas what i expected when it showed up I am liquid nailing them to a chalk board if you are dumb enough to use the double sided tape squares they send you then you deserve to have them fall off your wall the company should not even provide the little squares for this use there has no way they can hold the weight of the cork tile plus whatever you thumbtack to it,121,84
3188,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,i installed these with no problem but then discovered they are too thin for regular pushpins the pushpins only go halfway in so can not tack anything to the nine squares i painstakingly hung up arrrggghh would not recommend just spend the money on a big regular bulletin board i got these from a big box store fyi,57,85
3189,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,these tiles are good quality for the price i would reccomend buying mounting tape to hang them rather than using the mounting squares that come in the package we used the provided squares to start with and most of them fell off the wall the cork tiles are quite thin and several of them broke when they fell after buying a heavier duty mounting tape we were able to create a custome cork border for my daughters room that looks very nice,82,86
3190,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,i put this on a wall do not use the cheap double sided tape spread an even coat of clear silicon on the back and it will be fine,27,87
3191,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,the boards are perfect for my project but the adhesive that comes with them is not great,16,88
3192,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,i bought these to install a wall of cork tile after i did some research on pricier higher-quality cork tiles produced for this type of application i decided did not want to spend the money on the pricier tiles so i opted for these the dark stain makes them look like they are higher-end than the typical square cork tiles you can purchase at the store and they are significantly thicker and sturdier I am very happy with them for the price,78,89
3193,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,yes these are flimsy and crumbly and the adhesives do not hold the damned cork tiles up and they charge and outrageous price for shipping such lightweight materials a real rip off yet i can not find any other dark brown cork tiles out there they all apparently come from the same place and charge high shipping rates someone should manufacture a better product,62,90
3194,Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,makes a nice natural looking cork board the board is slightly darker compared to the pictures but has a nice overall tone the only problem with this product is that it is very crumbly and gets everywhere when installing,39,91
3341,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1.0,negative,absolute garbage terrible reception i had a job interview over the phone and neither one of us could hear each other i had o call back with my cell phone to finish the conversation i did get a second interview but this horrible product caused me embarrassment and possibly a job thanks for nuthin ge i donated the phones to goodwill and got new batteries for my old set which now work perfectly hopefully whoever buys this pos at goodwill does not really need to communicate with anyone,87,0
3342,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2.0,negative,it did not last very long it stopped working i had to have it replaced with a better quality phone there was static and interference,24,1

3345,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5.0,positive,i ordered these phones about 2 months ago they are great package they each work very well and i like that i can label each set for each room of the house,32,4
3346,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1.0,negative,nice to have all the handsets but the quality of sound on these is just terrible we could not even hear the other person on the line am returning these as soon as possible,30,5
3347,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5.0,positive,a good system for the price simple and does the job another review complained about the sound quality but i find the sound to be quite good i think it really depends on the infrastructure / provider,35,6
3348,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2.0,negative,after going through 4 phones over the last 7 - 8 years with panasonic and getting tired of the lost connection to base message from their handsets i thought I had try this one from ge phone arrived nice silver finish although flimsy feel handset did not snap into base i felt it was a bit wobbly no speakerphone on base unit but that was already known buttons offered stiffer resistance to the touch than panasonic if you consider that a good thing audio call quality was atrocious while calls did not drop the audio came in and out like shortwave radio for those of us who can remember decided this was unacceptable quality for something brand new returning to amazon i guess it is back to panasonic,125,7
3349,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2.0,negative,voice quality poor entries in telephone book on one handset do not register automatically in others,16,8

3353,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4.0,positive,i love my phones they work well the only thing missing is that they do not have the time on them if that was there it would be wonderful,28,12
3354,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1.0,negative,not a good phone at all i can not hear on them most of the time no one else can either,20,13

3357,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,4.0,positive,it is nice light weightgood and i can see the numbers and screen better we are glad we chose this one,22,16
3358,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,1.0,negative,this phones base unit will not mount on a wall if you need it in a place such as a kitchen where you want it out of the way of water or other kitchen hazards this is not the phone for you also it is very small in size i called the manufacturer to see if there was an adapter that i could purchase but the customer service rep was snotty and told me to go somewhere else to purchase one that worked best for me if i could find one and that those types were not manufactured anymore i could not believe her attitude i can not say how it sounds because i am re-packing it and sending it back i have purchased my last ge product after today,129,17
3359,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,2.0,negative,they arrive very quic look real nice but extremely hard to hear on or for you to be heard u would not buy this set again very disappointed,28,18

3365,Office_Products,B004YJR7E0,5.0,positive,probably the nicest phone set I have bought to date panel is easy to ready set-up was a snap batteries are included with the phone and they were fully charged within an hour would highly recommend,35,24
3404,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,as the brits say it does what it says on the tin the switches are nice and a cool blue led is included for nights in the forward berth of our boat the solar panel worked flawlessly and installation on our boat was simple i do not have any way of knowing how many cfm of air this thing actually moves but you can at least feel air movement when you have it on blow in mode recommended for an inexpensive ventilation device if you have sun available,88,0
3405,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,this small vent is intended for installation in a small utility trailer although i can not yet report on how it works when installed i found the battery operation of the light fan and directionality of airflow works well no sunlight indoors so do not yet know how the solar works the fan makes minimal noise when the unit is held as it will be when mounted however that disappears to no sound when tilted as little as 5/10 degrees,80,1
3406,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i put two of these on my 45 foot sailboat one set to suck and the other set to blow it was like a vortex of very mildly detectable solar powered tornado wormholes was created running through my boat from front to back it almost caused me to lose control of my helium indoors only r / c zombie shark but luckily i am an excellent air shark pilot and pulled through i am afraid to set them both to suck as it may because my ears to pop or i could pass out as it sucks all the oxygen out of the cabin but i think i can get out sometime in the 3 weeks it would take to do that i do have a scuba tank that should drop from the over head in an emergency air loss just in case i think the head trauma from the last time it deployed changed things in my brain so i kinda keep it taped up there,165,2
3407,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,this vent does not move much air you can barely tell it moves any air not worth the price do not waste your money ricko,21,3

3409,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,nicerealy works maybe a bit weak for an exhaust van but has worked continually for over a month,19,5
3410,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,product seems good although instructions were a bit ambiguous and not yet certain that it does all we hoped,19,6
3411,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,purchased 2 of these fans for a boat in june they look fine and nightlight is a nice feature they are crap do not buy them unless you just want a nice nightlight the fans will not start and operate unless you smack them even in bright sunlight so you become the switch they have a one year warranty so we will see how that goes,64,7
3412,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,it was great while it worked worked for 1 year and now it will only run on battery solar part does not work,22,8
3413,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,does not do much very little air is moved,8,9
3414,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,unfortunately this product did not hold up as advertised we are looking for something to replace it to fit in the hole that has been cut into our outbuilding any more damage would be bad,36,10
3415,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,do not expect a crazy difference but it does the job it works the light looks cool in our camper van and actually helps our vision at night again it is a small vent do not expect big vent differences in temperature I am happy with this product sawed a hole in roof of fiberglass went right in with some caulk vent is a tid bit noisy again to be expected it really does change the temperature i can feel it if i move my hand under it and the other on the other side that is not insulated and without a vent about 10 - 20 degrees difference consider the price of purchasing the saw hole component when you purchase this i think mine was about 40 at home depot,125,11
3416,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,works great for my outdoor she would just the right size and easy to install,14,12

3418,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,I am not sure if the fan is supposed to spin both ways but mine will only suck air in it will not blow air out which is really what i wanted,31,14
3419,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,lasted 1 year all rusted the circuit board is poorly made and fragile would not recommend this vent,18,15

3421,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,installed this solar vent in the front hatch of my sail boat about 4 weeks ago it is working as advertised no issues with leaks in normal weather conditions have not tested it in green water conditions although,37,17
3422,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,better battery would make this a 5 star,9,18
3423,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,it is ok for a tiny room tiny tiny room,9,19
3424,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,it was noisy and only lasted six months not worth the postage spent on it,15,20
3425,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,not worth the money as it moved literally no air that i could sense,14,21
3426,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so i returned it for my money back otherwise it worked and looked nice if it were not for a bedroom application i would probably have kept it,41,22
3427,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,so far so good works as advertised after 3 months the light is a nice added feature,17,23

3429,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,terrible lasted one month what a rip off,8,25
3430,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,do not buy this airflow is minimal and hardly worth the trouble it just does not have enough power,17,26
3431,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,good vent i wish it had a way of closing when i turn the vent off installation directions are very general so take your time and think it through if you not at handy person,35,27
3432,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,installed it and met my expectations it does not move a great air volume but is the same with any other solar vent pros you can invert air direccion in / out works at night by means of a rechargable bat and has a cortesy light cons does not move large air volume,49,28
3433,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,i put the su force in my small greenhouse nice features not as much airflow as i expected then it quit working after a couple of weeks i have not had time to try customer service so hopefully they will make it right,42,29
3434,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,i bought three of these to put in my rv they stay on all night running on the internal battery they are very quiet but they do not pull / push too much air,30,30
3435,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,works great is good quality and i like the features however the fan power is a bit weak if you have a small greenhouse it works fine but not for any house over 6 x 8,36,31
3436,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,high quality although full engineering i use it on my salt water coastal cruiser there is never too much ventilization in aboat,22,32
3437,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,using it in she had that is being built will not know till i experience it,15,33
3438,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,works once in a while when it feels like it too many switches confusing design blue light is inadequate and when the fan decides to come on it hardly moves any air at all,34,34
3439,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,i did not like them they are not stainless steel plus the inside is made of very chip plastic i guess i got what i paid for,26,35

3441,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,used in an 8x12 storage she had to keep humidity under control it is not going to win any prizes for air movement but it vents enough to do the job during the summer looks better than most options,37,37
3442,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,i would like to have it in place a while before i pass judgement the last one different mfg let me down after about a year,26,38
3443,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i live aboard a 40 feet sailboat and these vents supply me with outside air when conditions dictate all of my hatches need to be closed the addition of the lightng feature is the future will prove a plus it is surprising how much light is put out,48,39
3444,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,looks good and runs fine so far no more condensing on the boat interior instructions are poor on setting switches for anyone installing them the reason they say 4 1/2 inch hole is that 4 1/4 is to small it is not a tight fit in the 4 1/2 hole leaves room for doing an epoxy coating onor hatch coring,62,40
3445,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,it does not work plain and simple instructions are pretty much useless and there is no way to mount this without taking the cover off and drilling your own holes,30,41
3446,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,works great for venting rvs that sit out in the hot sun,12,42
3447,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,noisy but circulates as long as the sun is shining on it,12,43
3448,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i installed this myself and it works great,8,44
3449,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,very low flow but does the job i used it to vent an outhouse stink pipe and it works good battery does not make it through the night but it is mostly needed for hot days,34,45
3450,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,cheaply made does not seem to have much airflow do not know what it was meant to ventilate certainly nothing larger than a shorbox,22,46
3451,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,works well clean and easy to use and install started up right away we are using it to vent a greenhouse,21,47
3452,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,I am still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so i can not vouch for their efficiency but i wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is not 45 or 5 as stated in various comments here the instructions that come with the fan say cut a 45 diameter hole using the template provided the template measures 425 not 45 i cut a test 425 hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat so do not order that 45 hole saw and mandrel for 50 i used a 7 adjustable circle cutter that i got at harbor freight it worked fine i am replacing the plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so i have the luxury of doing this work in my shop the only other comment that i have about the fan is that the ss cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates i have quite a condensation problem in my boat so i am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust I shall keep you posted,201,48
3453,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,this solar vent was very easy to install and can potentially replace one meant for a 35 hole on my boat this replaced a 45 vent leaving a little bit of abut there is a beauty ring included that hides any size difference quite well the light is not enough to read by but will help you see the other switches in the dark the fan direction can be changed and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night it looks great easy to install I am very happy with it so far it was 3 times cheaper than those available at west marine so time will tell how well this truly holds up in a marine environment,130,49
3454,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,these are great low profile and work just fine my issue is this the exterior screws are rusting after only a week outside i doubt they will last very long the worse part the rusty water is leaving rusty streaks on my sailboatsruining my gelcoat and causing expensive damage to the paint i dunno what to do update today about one year later they broke seems they are not as waterproof as i had thought,77,50
3455,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i used in in mobile storage transport trailers does good job of keeping humidity in control hawaii 80 no mildew since installed,23,51
3456,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,to slow battery did not charge well instruction not clear it can be good for someone but not for me,20,52
3457,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,bought this sunforce stainless steel solar vent for my new vinyl storage she had to be cooler inside i think it would be a better unit if the electric fan in it ran faster i felt outside just under it and it does move some air just not enough i guess well built and durable housing also,56,53
3458,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2.0,negative,right out of the box it was slow to operate and you could see that the fan was not running true it wobbled and made a slight rubbing sound within a month it quit working due to a broken wire from the motor looking for a less expensive to the nicro i guess you get what you pay for,59,54
3459,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,the sunforce 81300 stainless steel solar vent appears to work as advertised helps to lower temp in rv in hot weather and circulate air when rv is not occupied without having to plug rv to power sold by amazon with free shipping at b000bynglu,46,55
3460,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,we are using this in a small hothouse and it works just great it was easy to install and seems to have reduced mid day temperatures significantly been working for about 3 months with no apparent problems,37,56
3461,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1.0,negative,this solar vent stopped working within six months of installing it and being after june 2012 amazon will only give me a partial credit and i pay for shipping and sunforce can not even return my phone calls or emails do not waste your money and now i have a hole in my she had,53,57
3462,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,short and sweet works great in my small greenhouse looks expensive i would buy this again if i ever need one,21,58
3463,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,i thought it was a bit pricy but the thing does work the light works as well this is not a tornado fan but is a small solar fan which we will use to move air through our cargo trailer,40,59
3477,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,i did not have any success with the seeds i followed the directions we did not have a single plant coming from the seeds would not recommend,27,0
3478,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5.0,positive,germans call this the maggi plant because it smells and tastes like the condiment maggi cut leaves into small bits and chuck them in your soup salad or whatever,29,1

3481,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5.0,positive,good quality seeds they germinate as expected without extra care once the plant develop roots it can spread out by itself i can not buy this plant in the grocery store because is not well known in the united states i like it in some soups and stews,46,4
3482,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,it was packed well i followed the instructions and planted 3 - 4 seeds in each of the 8 tiny starter pots i have 2 weeks later and nothing i will give it another extra days in case it takes it longer time to germinate before giving up on those seeds i will try another series of pots if nothing happens i will assume there is something wrong with the seeds the picture shows the situation 2 weeks after planting the seeds update i contacted the seller and no response,88,5
3483,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,the seeds did not sprout i planted them the same day with my marigold plant in planting starters that i kept inside due to njs variable temperature at this time a year the marigolds are ready to be transplanted they are 3 inches tall the lovage did not germinate at all,52,6

3486,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4.0,positive,we will see after planted if they sprout,8,9
3487,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5.0,positive,sprouts very fast and have nice plants lovage is super in anything you would use celery i hope to bring some plants in this fall to use over the winter,30,10
3488,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,5.0,positive,it is hard in az to keep greens during the heat but i planted some lovage seeds and got really nice leaves before the heat came,25,11
3489,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,all seeds were old or dry none of them come out from the ground i try 3 different times in different pots none come out sorry,26,12
3490,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,1.0,negative,major disappointment they did not germinate waste of money,10,13
3491,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4.0,positive,i live in florida and i realized after ordering these that late spring might not be the best time here to grow this but i tried anyway germination rates were good but i think they are sensitive to the heat here it is unbelievable out there right now i am going to try again in the fall I shall update later this herb is amazing although the small amount i did manage to grow smells just like celery leaves and are perfect for soups,81,14
3492,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B006RIDHHW,4.0,positive,i ordered this after a different packet failed to even sprout these ones did sprout but very slowly maybe it was my fault since i may have planted them a little too late in the year next time I am going to plant them indoors and have lovage throughout the winter great for vegetable soups,54,15
3493,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
3494,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,these work great holding not only the hose end of my high-powered dryer for the corgis but can also support the weight of a hand-held dryer for our papillon the clamps are very stiff and if you have any problems with lack of hand strength this product will be a challenge to use,53,1
3495,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,the clamp is strong i need 2 hands to clamp it down the black little plastic covers at the clamp tips slide off easy i suppose one could glue them back into place with some glue-epoxy just have not gone through the trouble of doing that yet for at home use it works fine anything fancier and you are in the professional grooming business i suppose like an extendable flex arm which rotates on / from your ceiling around the dog d have not used it but a few times,86,2
3496,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,I have used thisonce and so far I am loving it my american cocker puppy squirms a bit when she has on the grooming table after getting her bath the groomers third arm allows me to keep both hands on her while still being able to dry her off cuts my time in half very sturdy well made product,58,3
3497,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does my only minor complaints might be that for a woman the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality you should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps will not completely protect theof the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table i would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on overall a good quality product,110,4
3498,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
3499,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i actually returned this grooming arm it was not strong enough to hold the hose,14,6
3500,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open clamp does not really work well too heavy,11,7
3501,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,love this for my hand held hair dryer much better than holding under my chin for fluff drying,18,8
3502,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,very sturdy but the plastic covers on the clamps are cheap thin and fall off easily when the clamps are opened i have secured mine with electrical tape,28,9
3503,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i work as a dog bather and do a lot of force drying some of my larger project dogs have been difficult to dry taking about a half hour with a reducer cone and two motors going it was a lot of hair i bought this to stretch dry some of my hairier clients to really fluff them up for a groom the first day i attached it to my table it got used on a matted doodle and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat the doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker so did that golden it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile if you are thinking of buying a stretch dryer or a big stand dryer try this first i was ready to spend 200 on a stand dryer when this 40 tool fixed all my problems,177,10
3504,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works great my only complaint is i can not take the hose off the clamp and put it back by myself,20,11
3505,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
3506,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this product does what it says it will do free up one hand so you can dry and brush the dog at the same time my only concern was that it was very hard to squeeze the clamp to attach it to the table,45,13
3507,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,exactly what it says it is very pleased,8,14
3508,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,exactly what i needed to help me dry my old english sheepdogs i tried to fashion one of these for myself and it was an epic fail this one works perfectly,31,15
3509,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
3510,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works perfect now i can keep both my has on my dogs / cats,12,17
3511,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i use this to hold a shower head to wash my dogs in the sink in the laundry room it gets rusty after 6 month because of the splash of water so i just bought a new one photo attached,40,18
3512,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,wanted to like it i could not squeeze the handles when i was able too clamp it on it would pop off,22,19
3513,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is ok it holds the dryer hose well but the extension is not long enough to clap onto theof a table and dry pets from the top down which is important when grooming yorkies cresties and shihtzus this is not a must havebut it serves it is purpose well,50,20
3514,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this thing was in my cart for a very long time i thought it was too pricey for what it was and was looking for cheaper things to use i ended up buying a cell phone clamp which worked great for my metro quick-draw force dryer but when i bought the big-daddy metro force dryer it would not hold the heavier hose i finally bit the bullet and bought it and it makes my home grooming so much easier it is very study but forgiving when moving it i usually take the nozzle off my hose and turn it all the way down so i can use it as a fluff dryer love the size too mine came all black which i like better than the orange,126,21
3515,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,clamps are too hard to open mine broke off where the clamp piece meets the flex pipe after only a year,21,22
3516,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,works protective rubber tips come off and tear very easily,10,23
3517,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it does not fit the hose with an attachment on it and the clamps are so stiff i can barely get it on the end of the hose without the attachment,30,24
3518,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,very difficult to position and to squeeze the grips do not use on plastic,15,25
3519,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,strong grip bend to where you want it holds in place,11,26
3520,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,is there a softer version of this very handy tool i can not even press the clips open enough to clip onto my grooming table and yes i do open my own pickle jars the clip on the other end is also so strong that i fear it will crush the hard plastic at the end of my dryer hose i would recommend this product only to the incredible hulk,69,27
3521,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this did not hold up my nozzle to my dryer at all,13,28
3522,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,my wife wanted a hands-free hairdryer holder and this fit the bill perfectly i mounted this to a cabinet door in the toilet area next to my wifes sink it is been hanging there for a few months and has not fallen yet despite a few head bumps on my part,49,29
3523,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps take super strength to open i could not do it donated to goodwill,15,30
3524,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm did not attach tightly to the table moved around and the arm was so stiff it took two hans to adjust,23,31
3525,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,this is a very bad design i am going to return mine,12,32
3526,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,need strength in your hands to work these clips but once attached great,15,33
3527,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,excellent sturdy and able to hold the weight of a hand drier also only problem is needing to have strong hands to open and shut the clamp but then if it were not tight it would let slip the thing it is holding would not it,43,34
3528,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open much too strong a grip i do not bother using it at all because it is so difficult to use and i am not a weakling,29,35
3529,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this is great frees up both hands for combing / brushing,9,36
3530,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,received as advertised works great great packaging fully recommended seller,10,37
3531,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this thing is poor quality for the price the reviewer that said replace the rubber tips withtape was spot on as soon as i tried to use the clamp the rubber tips slide off and cracked junk the arm itself is weak the weight of my dryer makes it drop down so i had to mount it high and place dryer on the bottom so gravity would help position instead of fight it i paid 32 at 15 it would have been worth the price at 32 it is not a good deal,95,38
3532,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,too hard to to bend or open the clamps men probably can do it but i could not,17,39
3533,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the clamps do not want to stay clamped to anything and if you do get it to stay put as soon as you move the arm the clamp let us go,29,40
3534,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,it is very nice and really helps to dry the coat of show dogs there is one small issue however it takes awhile to loosen the clamps and until that happens it is really difficult for me to open the clamps wide enough to use but then I had rather have it this way than the reverse such that the clamps open easily upon first purchase and then become too loose after use all and all a good buy,76,41
3535,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamp on the bottom of the table does not hold tight you may turn the flexible arm upside down and use the other end of the clamp and it will do the same it is not tight enough for when you move the dryer hose around there has constant fixing and adjusting something that you do not you should not be doing when a dog in on the table,66,42
3536,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the rubber clips always slip off the arm can not hold up the weight of a human hairdryer clamps are very stiff,21,43
3537,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is great for what it is suppose to do but the clamps are really hard to open and after being clamped on the table for a while it left a mark but it is worth it if slight damage to your table is not a big issue also my table has a vinyl coat on the top so it is easy to damage it with something like this the coil part is easy to maneuver and the clamps swivel making it pretty simple to get it right where you want it,90,44
3538,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
3539,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i do love this product and it is very helpful but i do not use it as often as i thought i would still it does the job,26,46
3540,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,grooming my 3 yorkies takes time this dryer surely cuts that time in half only drawback is the really hard spring in the clip almost have to use two hands to get it open enough to clamp on the table other than that it is a great deal,47,47
3541,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,not flexible am unable to aim the dryer end where i need it to be the grip is too tight I am afraid it will break my dryer hose end,29,48
3542,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i actually used this arm to mount a video baby monitor near the crib to get the best vantage point without hanging over the crib itself this arm worked very well each clamp is strong and stays in place i was even able to temporarily unscrew one clamp to cover the arm with a baby mobile arm cover to match the room decor the arm itself positions well and is stiff enough to stay where you set it just what i needed,82,49
3543,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm is so stiff it is impossible to move it around to dry different areas of the dog if you just want one to stay in one spot it is great if you want to dry the whole dog it is a huge disappointment,44,50
3544,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,it does a great job i do not have a problem with it at allit is easy to mount and i can angle it just where i need it my hands are free to do the dogs thanks so much,40,51
3545,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,saved me a fortune as i use my blow dryer with this instead of the expensive forced air dryer and since i have show quality persians and exotic shorthairs to groom daily i am totally satisfied fits perfect on any and all my grooming tables or counter tops,48,52
3546,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is too hard to open and grab the blower it can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently but not to travel as i needed,30,53
3547,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
3548,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies other than really is working,24,55
3549,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a simple product and it does what it says it does my biggest complaints is that for a me the clamps are very hard to squeeze open anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps the other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time i used them overall a very good quality product the product has been great for me,78,56
3550,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,thisworked as discribed and was a life saver in my work with the dogs i have to groom it is everything it claims to be in it is advertisement and a definite must for all groomers who have more then 4 pets a day to wash and groom,48,57
3551,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,i bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs it does not really work and i have not been able to sucessfully use it yet and I have had it for about 2 months it will not stay in place the clamps just slide around on the counter maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that was not smooth the clamps are really hard to get open so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job on the bright side i can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose,100,58
3552,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the basicof this grooming arm is good but what you will not realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate the clips are extremely difficult to open in fact they are impossible for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands it was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room unused,83,59
3553,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,does what it is supposed to do but expect the black plastic endcaps to come off the first time you use it i intend to use some epoxy to glue them on permanently this is the only issue that kept me from giving the device a 5-star rating,46,60
3554,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i mean who could not use a third arm when trying to dry a dog this product is perfect for freeing up your hands and your concentration when drying your pet it is well-made with heavy bolts and clamps it is flexible yet it stays in the position you set it to get your work done each grip comes with holes on both sides which allow you to bolt this product to your grooming table you will want to do that otherwise you will not enjoy it is full benefit meaning you will have to use two hands to reset the grip if you need to adjust it during a drying session nuts screws and washers for securing it to your work station are not included in the packaging it would be nice although if they were,131,61
3555,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
3556,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
3557,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i used this with a blow dryer on my grooming table to finish the head and face of my dogs i was afraid it might not support the weight of the dryer but it is not even an issue no matter where i position it or twist it it holds it wherever i place it i did not have the money for a conventional stand dryer but i think I shall be just find as long as i have the third arm,80,64
3558,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i purchased third arm mainly so that i can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat totally what it is intended and designed to do for me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top i needed to use two arms than i clamped the blow dryer to the top arm but than when i had a wet cat ready to blow dry i could not move the third arm i tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off eventually i was able to screw it back on after i blew dry my cat without third arm but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod hitting on impact me my cat and the mirror in front really useless if you use metro dryer the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod it is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder i could do without,190,65
3845,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,i always thought that publisher 2000 was easy to use this upgrade is even easier even someone who has never used publisher before can make outstanding postcards flyers newsletters and publications what a excellent product,34,0
3846,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,as much as i hate to admit that microsoft has done a good job i have to on this one the improved interface makes it so much easier to use users of old versions of publisher will be pleasantly surprised that this one is definitely worth the money for the upgrade if you have never used a desktop publishing program before check this one out you will not be disappointed i am running an entire small printing business from this program alone the only reason i have not given 5 stars is because i still want to be able to create text boxes in shapes round triangleinstead of square and rectangle,112,1
3847,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,this is a good product i have publisher 2000 and i like to added features and the new templetes realy worth the money microsoft has done it again with really great features and value,36,2
3848,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,publisher 2002 is a pretty good product i have not had any of the prolems that some other people have had it runs great on my machine never crashed once it has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it but stay away from the bundle with the photo editior included because the photo editior has almost no functionality,76,3
3849,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,while most people will tell you that microsoft bit the big one on their latest release of productivity programs the office xp suite i personally feel that they have done ok while the 2002 series does not differ too much from it is predecessors publisher includes what i think to be a very important feature stability there is not a sole on this earth that can deny the reliablity and stability of xp whether we talk about windows xp office xp or microsoft anything 2002 i dare you to try to make if crash good luck for those of you in corporations ask your employees what the most irritating part of their day is you will undoubtedly get the response when my tools crash while microsoft might have changed minor settings in publisher to make it slightly annoying for the few you can not go wrong with the increased reliablity of the product so suck it up shut up and enjoy it,157,4
3850,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,publisher 2000 was bad stupid me i thought maybe 2002 would be better not save your money and buy print shop or print master platium they work better for less money and take up less real estate on your hard drive the interface is even less intitutive that previously the most common task that even i can make word 97 accomplish will not work in publisher sorry microsoft i will not be buying this again everything the other reviewers have said times 10,81,5
3851,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,without a doubt the worst canned program i have encountered in almost 10 years of buying software after 2 months on the phone with support i have still not beat the kinks out of this dog bcentral is only to happy to charge me 30 bucks a month for hosting a site that will never be launched with this pig no wonder they include it with every signup a guarantee that the space on the server will never be used pass on this pig,84,6
3852,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,and you can not find a download for a very specific piece of software your friend needs it surprises you with a wonderful website that let us you purchase a copy for cheap and totally redeems itself thanks internet and thank you amazon,41,7
3853,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,arrived quickly and in good condition with activiation code on the package i needed this to access some old files that coulldnt be opened in publisher 2010 worked great i prefer this version in a lot of ways,38,8
3854,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,this product was very price-worthy was easy to install and has performed perfectly since i bought it it is doing exactly what i hoped and more the product itself was in excellent condition,33,9
3855,Software,B00005AFI4,2.0,negative,my goodness you would think a 10 billion company could do better than this they talk about double sided printing you can not even print even or print odd pages you have to sit in front of your computer and print each and every page manually you can not print to an image file well yes you can but the low resolution makes the file unusable you can not print to a pdf printing to a post script file cut off half the image on one of the projects this product assumes your printing service uses publisher guess what most do not david,99,10
3856,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i agree poor girl i am a real newbie massage therapist turned computer user and have found this program to be a web creators nightmare i think I shall cruise on down to the freeware sites to see what i can scare up there i want a fairly simple web page that links to a few more for those of us that know the anatomy of the human body better than html i would stay away from this beast it will make the less confident feel even more so and by the way these other sugar coated reviews does microsoft pay some slouch to type them up all day or what nauseating,108,11
3857,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i was looking for a helpful upgrade and instead got perhaps the most user unfriendly software i have used in a long long time i am a software tester by profession and would have failed this product on poor usability stay with the previous version,45,12
3858,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i bought this product and love the results on my screen unfortunately it does not look so beautiful anymore when i print the pages out the preview and printout are fuzzy as if in draft mode all my other applications print out just fine i contacted novas technical support but the only help they offered was to send another disk which did not solve the problem now they ask me to be patient while they try to figure out my problem i have waited a few weeks now and am very disappointed no matter how great the software is if there is no real technical support it is worthless,108,0
3859,Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this software gives great guidlines for begginer scrapbookers,8,1
3860,Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this is pretty easy to use and I am having fun with it i can not compare it with any other scrapbook programs since this is the only one I have used but from what i see this is really all i need,40,2
3861,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i absolutely love this program and totally agree with the lady that found it to be one of the best programs that she owns i have had no problems with this program locking up or anything i made our christmas cards on it this past year and got lots of compliments i also made scrapbooks as gifts for christmas and got many compliments on my work this is a wonderful program and i am so happy that i purchased it,80,3
3862,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i would like to say this is a great program but it will noton my computer i have never had this problem with any other program before some kind of computer glitch blamed on everyone else other than the person i happen to be talking to at the moment after about 30 mins of several toll calls and a couple downloads no luck well I am off for another program,70,4
3863,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i almost did not buy this program because of the negative reviews but having worked in retail before i realized that people are more likely to complain than say anything posative i love this program i could go on all day about it i have so many ideas for projects and that is great because there are endless possabilities with this program you can make your project as personal as you want it to be add graphics of your own or alter their graphics to suit your mood you can add pictures and make them look antique as well as shape them into various shapes and styles add text here lighten here change colors it is fabulous as far as the pictures printing out clearly I have had no problem of course when altering your pictures if you force it into a shape that the pixels can not accomadate certainly there would be some problems digital pictures work best but my scanned ones have done well too just have fun and play with it i would reccomend this program to anyone interested in a unique and fun way to save their memories,187,5
3864,Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,i was disappointed when i tried to play around with this product it is going back to the store today you can not print out just an element of the scrapbook other than stickers without printing out an entire layout so if for example you want to use one of the few borders that comes with the program or have the time to tweak shapes into borders or mats or whatever beware you must print the whole page and you can not export images either this is basically a limited unflexible clipart program that might be good if all you want is to design for the web using the few choices of graphics they have otherwise stay away and save for a real scrapbook program i have not tried hallmark keep scrappin with scissors and paper if this is the best there is out there,143,6
3865,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i already had scrapbook factory on a different computer i have all of my business forms in that program but did not have the disc any longer the only drawback is not being able to copy all of my old forms onto a flash drive if you buy this keep up with your discbecause it will not recognize the program it was made from when you try to open old files from a flash drive,72,7
3866,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,this edition of scrapbook factory is not nearly as good as scrapbook factory deluxe 4 i have played with all four editions and they got it right with the fourth one three is close and as far back as i am willing to go although you can not extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages in four you can create jpegs as well as pdfs of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive it took me all of a half hour before i had my first page done showing people the ropes of the software i gave version four as a christmas gift to a few people took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own you can get a copy of four for about 2000 more than this version and i feel it it well worth it many pages i have done people think were done with 40000 photoshop do not waste your time with this software evolves over time and generally becomes more powerful and user friendly as it evolves,187,8
3867,Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,what a disappointment considering modern day programs this one is primative it reminds me of apps 15 years ago it is complicated yet limited in what it can do i have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as front it can not be done I have clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest no luck even the tutorial is non-interactive additionally pages can not be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste further each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects the help section is also very basic one good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job additionally no problem running this with windows 7 have not used any other scrapbook programs but i sure would not recommend this one,156,9
3868,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i am extremely displeased with this product the software is anything but user friendly and the graphics are extremely cheesy any attempts i made at developing a scrapbook page were foiled due to extreme frustration with the program overall the product needs a drastic update and i am disappointed with my purchase,52,10
3869,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,to those with print quality issues it is your printer or printer preference settings there is a lot of flexibility and creative potential with this software it is also easy to use my 10-year-old who never saw it before jumped right in and is creating terrific pages can not beat it for the price,50,11
3870,Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook with so that i can still print out pages and not just have them on the computer this one does not print well at all I have tried printing one of thier premade pages pages I have created from scratch with and with out pics put in and everything comes out pixilized i have not had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges i do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as i do not use this program another thing i found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic if you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them this program would be ok if you do not want to print the pages out but if you do look for something else,162,12
3871,Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this program is easy to use and helped me create a custom scrapbook page with little effort one caveat once you select a size template be certain to check the result with print preview before you expend any effort i had trouble getting the first page i created to print in 12 x 12 size on a 12 x 12 sheet of paper however i called tech support the first rep did not help much but then i got a follow-up call from derek who had gone to the trouble of downloading my canon s9000 printers driver together we got the print function going and produced a perfect page it is really refreshing to find a software outfit that really cares about the results it is customers are getting it is too bad that the templates supplied with this program are so cutesy and schmaltzy and that more background paper is not supplied but if you start with a blank template hey it is a clean slate and you can let your imagination run wild it will let you drop in your pictures and graphics wherever and help with the lettering for titles and journaling,189,13
4027,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,i do not like the look feel or fit of these grips the size fits my hand a bit better than my hard rubber hogue grips but does not feel as comfortable and does not look as good also the fit on the gun is just a bit off enough to make it look a bit cheap,55,0
4028,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,i purchased pachmayr grips for my ruger super blackhawk many years ago and they are great expecting the same qualitly i purchased the grips for my ruger redhawk and was very disappointed they do not fit good and the grip screw nut was loose in the grip and just turns round making it hard to get the screw out when i got the screw out the nut fell out in my hand the grips are loose very narrow and do not fit my hand at all now i know that no one set of grips can fit everyone is hand but these are very awkward and i am going to return them,109,1
4029,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,i ordered pistol grips for my s w bodyguard model 49 and they sent me grips for a rugar redhawk 44 mag i have tried numerous times to contact the company to exchange for the proper gribs and they never got back to me i also attempted to call them but you only get an answering machine i left several messages and they never returned a call i would not recommend this company to anybody I am not trying to get my money back just the correcti ordered,88,2
4030,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,these are the only choice for my ruger redhawk with high powered ammo the reduced recoil felt makes them the best choice for me shipping and service from leavitt enterprises the amazon supplier was exceptional,35,3
4031,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,these grips are just sad they do not meet up properly along the seem and are so soft that the hammer pin works it is way free with only five pulls of the trigger if you have hand like brock lessner then they may fit your hand i have large hands and they are just to big and poorly designed bottom line is to save your mony and bye the houge tamer there just better in every way,76,4
4032,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,1.0,negative,grip has 1/2 inon front of frame,9,5
4033,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,not very well made did not fit very well has gaps at the front part of the grip,18,6
4034,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,only shot five rounds with the new grip and found it just super the initial shock was completely absorbed and i had just the regular kick back now i can not wait to really burn some powder with it,38,7
4035,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,i like these better than the hogue grips i have both for the same 44 magnum shooting heavy 44 loads is tolerable now,23,8
4036,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,perfect fit painless install and very comfortable grip,8,9
4037,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,four stars for design but only rated two stars because of the poor quality of the product this grip fits my hand better than the hogue grip but the hogue quality is much better i like that this grip has a very thin cover of the back strap but when installed the front of the grip along the finger grooves does not meet this leaves athat runs the entire length of the grip,75,10
4038,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,2.0,negative,this pair of grips did not fit my redhawk correctly there was a pronouncedalong the front where the two halves meet,23,11
4039,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,5.0,positive,i bought three different grips before i found this one this is the one that takes the bite out of the recoil it has a thin layer that covers the metal strip on the back of the handle it is what is needed to keep it recoil shock from resignating through your arm makes the redhawk feel like a super redhawk,62,12
4040,Sports_and_Outdoors,B000JZ134S,4.0,positive,i can not give firsthand advice about this my brother needed it and is very happy with the purchase i do not even really know what it is,26,13
4150,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,i bought this tent at an army surplus store for a big game hunt have yet to use it for that but I have spent numerous nights in it outside I shall admitt it is a little tricky to use right out of the package but once aquainted with set up it is bliss to sleep in keeps rain bugs and uneven cold ground out of the equation you will need extra rope for the main supports string for the canopy support and you shall have to store all but the smaller gear underneath the hammok also a pillow not for your neck but for under your knees the curve of the hammok stresses them a little hope this helps,114,0
4151,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,ok this hammock does require extra rope to even set up it may seem ungainly at first but if you are patient with it you will be rewarded i reccomend using a very sturdy rope to set up the wight bearing portion of the hammock i just use fishing line a spool of it would seem useful in a backpacking situation anyways to hold up the netting and top tarp it is sort of scary to get into but if set up properly and entered with care is actually pretty comfortable inside i think it is great for backpacking or camping where you need to be off the ground very light and takes very little space be smart and you will have no problems btw i weigh about 220 lbs and have no problems with it,133,1
4152,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,we bought this hammock in march 2010 and did not even take it out of the box and use it until august i would give it 0 stars if i could after one use the seams of the straps that attach to the ropes began to pull apart from the body of the hammock making for a very dangerous situation if someone were not to inspect and notice it before climbing in the one person who used it that one time was far under the weight limit the manufacturer rates the hammock so that was not the issue this is an extremely dangerous product granted for the price you do not expect the quality to match the best on the market however that is entirely not the issue at any price you have the right to expect safety if used within the guidelines the manufacturer sets for the product if someone were to climb in and the straps were to snap a major back or other injury could result i notified amazon and they stated they have had complaints about thisi guess not everyone takes the time to write a review i can only hope they remove it from their inventory,201,2
4153,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,i bought this hammock for local hiking trips and maybe an overnighter like the other person stated it is a pain in the neck to set up yes you will need extra line to set it up and it is not wide enough this thing is better suited to be set up as a ground based mosquito proof shelter why would you do that if that is the case then just buy a net and save on time money and the added extra weight of this junk i do not reccomend this cheap alternative to buying something better like a hennessy or other quality name brand hammock,106,3
4154,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,pros not much it is cheap and has a mosquito net attached zippers seams and stress points are relativley sturdy although I have only used it twice so far less bulky than carrying a sleeping pad and tent cons there are no directions on how to set this hammock up normally it would seem like a no brainer as most hammocks come out of the box with the suspension ropes intertwined / braided into the actual hammock but this hammock does not you get the hammock the canvas net nylon and seperatley the rope and metal rings you need an additional 30 feet of rope to suspend the mosquito net and nylon roofing no way is this rain worthy as is you need to get an additional tarp plus another 20 feet of rope heavy especially with all the additonal rope and tarping pretty narrow on the inside especially with the net zipped up and inside a sleeping bag,152,4
4155,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,great product slept in it in the woods and not one bite,12,5

4167,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,theof this thing is actually better than how it works i took this on a three night trip in the mountains of west virginia it was pretty cold do you know why there are signs before bridges that say bridge freezes before road well that is because there is cold air going over and under the bridge thereby making the bridge colder same thing happens while sleeping in a hammock it is cold furthermore if you move in your sleep and i mean at all you will wake up constantly trying to reposition yourself one time i woke up and the entire hammock had shifted to where i was laying on the mosquito net portion of the hammock overall very cheap fabric and just not a practical solution to camping in the woods,134,17
4168,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,seems to be great piece except u have to buy some extra pieces which they do mention,17,18
4169,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,for the price i would recommend this you need a little patience and common sense to use it but it does work well tip when you string it up put all the weight / tension on the bottom ropes put hardly any weighton the mosquito netting because the straps will break and the hammock will suddenly drop until the main ropes pick up thewas well worth the entertainment factor for a boy scout who did not trust me,79,19

4174,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,this is very cumbersome to use getting in and out of it if you are anything over 5 - 9 it is too small,20,24
4175,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,awesome tent a lot of people complained about not being able to close the zipper once you get inside you need to hang the netting using 1/8 bungee cord not rope this allows the tent netting and canopy to flex the only issue i had with this is that we camped at 11000 feet during a really cold and rainy week i brought a small tarp with me to cover the hammock that kept me dry but when the wind blew it got cold specially underneath it the answer to the problem was to use an emergency blanket to keep the wind from penetrating my sleeping bag the other issue was finding 4 trees spaced right to hang it tried using 2 connections and the hammock was not as stable once i connected it at 4 points it worked awesome,139,25
4176,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,this is product is good in theory setting it up for the first time for summer camp was the only time it was used the mosquito netting tore very easily and the zipper pull fell off leaving the product zipped up there was no fixing it to make it useful and therefore other sleeping arrangements had to be made at the last minute,63,26
4177,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,wonderfulit is a lot better then sleeping on the ground i am not sure if they make a two person one i would buy it in a heartbeat and would and have told everyone about this,39,27

4181,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,my husband was very impressed with the quality and how easy it was to put up need to make sure the trees are far enough apart or it will sink to the ground,33,31
4182,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,this hammock was a bit more narrow than i expected laying on it as designed i found that my arms were prone to just fall over the sides unless i crossed my chest mummy-style with them the bag that it came with ripped on the first use and i was intentionally trying to take it easy on it the ropes that tie together on it seemed a bit iffy some fraying going on combined with the material which i knew before i purchased I had say this is nothing but maybe a bargain basement hammock,96,32
4183,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,on my last 4 day kayak trip i wanted to have the hammock with mosquito netting but it flipped me out on the first night and the mosquito netting came undone the second night i would not recommend thisto anyone buy an eno or a hennessy they are worth the money in the long run,57,33
4184,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,awful not stable at all you have to be a less than 150 to sleep on this if your any bigger it is not stable i threw it in the trash,33,34
4185,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,this is a good hammock but it does not come with the necessary hanging equipment i had to buy that else where brings the cost to the same as my other hammock which i like better this hammock provides a better view of what has around you the other hammock kinda blocks your view of everything but the sky heres the link to the other hammock i bought as well as this one the skeeter beeter comes with everything you need and is harder to fall out of,89,35
4186,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,very durable but kind of small good for it is uses although outdoor shelters are hard to find this one is well built just take a tarp with you if you are going into a high rain risk,37,36

4191,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,i have to admit this tent is a little complicated to set up until you get used to it but it is a great tent especially in the south where mosquitoes and insects are plentiful most of the year,39,41
4192,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,i purchased this in thinking it would be more like a cot than a hammock and then to use as a tent was wrong about both we set it up hung and it did not come out looking nothing like the picture the bottom did not lay flat like the picture shows it was all bunched up and not very wide at all and when attempted to get in it it was very hard to do since the zipper is on theof the bottom and when i finally was able to get in it it flipped so we tried to set it up like a tent since it shows that you can do that to well it did set up kinda like a tent if you peg the bottom down to the ground tight like your suppose to forget getting in it that is for sure and then if you get it loose enough to get in you have to crawl on the ground to get in since as i said before the zipper is on the bottomneedless to say i sent it back also it does not come with hangers or pegs,195,42
4193,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,my son went to sleep in it at scout camp and top part was not sewn correctly and ripped only had 10 mins use will have to send out and pay to have it fixed,35,43
4194,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,got this for backpacking a little heavy for pack my husband packs it in his pack due to weight of it it does a good job in keeping out rain and bugs just be careful at bedtime not to move much or you will flip over so we staked each corner down with tent stakes seemed to fix problem yes i would recommend it anyone,65,44
4195,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,slept in this hammock for a week at boy scout camp very comfortable easy to set up it could be a little wider and the fabric over the top could be a little heavier to better repel water but with three sides open essentially the whole thing is not water proof but this material is nearly a sieve for the price however can not beat it,65,45
4196,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,back in the 50s i remember sleeping in jungle hammocks at girl scout camp i purchased this for my grand children and now want to order one for myself i received this in a matter of days,35,46
4197,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,this was a gift for my nephew and it was put up in his room which is used all the time it is well made and durable i would recommend this hammock to a friend I shall probably buy another one for camping,41,47
4198,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,this is nice and i feel better knowing nothing will be crawling on me but there are no directions and i can not find any to hang this model plus we do not have enough rope to hang the hammock and since the screen does not zip off all the way we can not use it without hanging the screen so we are looking for rope or bungis to attach the top of the screen if it were able to disconnect then we could use it with out the screen until we got the extra roping,96,48
4199,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,i absolutely love this thing a real life saver the only thing i would advise others to do is by some extra rope but other than that this is a awesome hammock,31,49

4202,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,difficult to set up requires a lot of tweeking to get it right very narrow and hard to fit into it is okay for a child or smaller person but for a bigger guy with broad shoulders no way price was okay functionality was just overall bad,46,52
4203,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,at first this looked to be a promising solution to a problem i was having whilst hiking after receiving this product and opening the box to examine it is contents i was eager to test this product when i was setting the hammock up the loops on each end of the hammock which bunch the ends to form the typical hammock upon hand testing the sag of the hammock i am not quite sure what the material actually is which supports the ends of the hammock however i am sure that this product would not stand up to even the most modestunfortunately I shall be returning this product as soon as possible,112,53

4206,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,barely wide enought for an adult needs to at least be 1 1/2 times it is current size very dissapointed in this hammock,22,56
4207,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,this hammock looks great from the outside however it is very cheaply made when i set up the tent it was hard to get the right height and was very uncomfortable to get into pros it is cheap for what it is it is easy to carry around has a decent mosquito net cons does no tome with rainfly shown in some of the pictures the side netting tore little they do not come with ropes to set it up and the entire thing is just uncomfortable it is extremely narrow on the inside it is not fully water proof overall i would recommend steering away from this hammock and spend the money on a bigger better hammock,113,57
4208,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,it is been sitting in my closet for 2 years still do not know how to set it up and do not want to spend that much energy trying i do not know about durability or waterproof but it feels like canvas,38,58
4209,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5.0,positive,i just got it and so far it appears to be rugged material not cheep stuff i was surprised at the quality compared to the price I had get another one as far as walkin in the deep woods and needing a place to take a nap there is no better way than off the ground in a mosquito net i saw a review saying it was cheep he was not honest i know cheep and hate it i will say there is not the canvas that is in the picture and no extra rope to tie it to a tree it also says there is no directions if you can not figure how to tie a not to a tree stay at home but it looks like it is well worth buying,130,59
4210,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,received this product and the construction was poor strings were loose everywhere and the zipper kept snagging it was also quite small and I am 55 135 lbs which is hard to do avoid this and get something of better quality and larger size,43,60

4212,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,as long as your under 6 foot and 250 pounds this mosquito hammock is fine when used with a rainfly over the top yes it takes a few hangs before you get it right remember to tie it up high but straight across use the roof only to block sun a rainfly is needed as with all the topend hammocks out there it is a must have you have a canvas bottom which means less chance of a mosquito bite from below as compared to a nylon hammock a bit heavier but still packable not very wide but for the normal size person you can lay flat or on your side with no problems a pad and a sleeping bag makes this a winner works pretty good on the ground as well with cot or bottom cloth it does everything the big boy hammocks do at a much cheaper price ofcourse you can not brag you spent 30000 on your hammock but do you really want to video available [ ],167,62

4216,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1.0,negative,i bought these under the pretense that they were cheap and i could install them in a few seconds before my trips to the woods worst decision i ever made with 15 not only are they flimbsy terribly made but not a single gun out of my collection will fit in these things the diameter of the hooks is only about 1 1/2 icnhes wide no shotgun or any ar or carbine style rifle will fit only my rem 700 would fit but the scope rubbed on the roof and it would not fit in the bottom so it was out of the question as well only a pellet gun also the bottom hooks are so close to the top hooks that not even a pellet gun will fit inside i only recommend if you wanted to spend a solid hour dremel in hand as i did increasing the diameter and cutting an inch of the bottom hooks other than that do not buy go with the roof rack or a seat hanging bag just as long as you do not go with these,181,2

4228,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2.0,negative,i got these to put in the back window of my pickup they are pretty flimsy and it seemed like no matter what i did i could not get them to stay in place i wanted to be able to set my m1a in these but the hooks were not wide enough for her i know that an m1a is a bit bigger of a rifle than most a mans gun if you will but these hooks were a solid 3/4 too narrow i may end up drilling and tapping the metal near the window and running a screw through these i might also just not worry about it and just mount these in the workshop to keep the guns I am working on off of the desk if you are just going to put small rifles or ones that you will not mind falling then these are decent if not i would recommend getting some more serious gun racks,154,14

4296,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,2.0,negative,you have to use wooden shims for the back window of a f-250 ford pickup and that is with the divided back window that has slots you can fit the rack footing into even then both assemblies are wobbly because of the plastic construction i do not know if you can use this rack with the factory installed back window and there are no installation instructions to help you with any work around substandard all round even for the price i would not bother even trying this one to see if it might work for nine bucks it will not,97,82

4303,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,1.0,negative,they work ok but no matter how much you push and make them tight they will still move around the will tilt as you hang items on them some times when placing a gun on it one may completely come out also the adjustment is only to the distance from the top holder to the roof so you can not adjust the distance from the bottom nor can you adjust between the j holders foget about using the bottom holders if your seats have any type of head rest too they maybe ok if your using it for an 80s truck or older or maybe on the back side glass of a suburban,112,89

4309,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4.0,positive,it took several tries before i realized the ends really needed to be pushed hard behind the back glass trim i am not sure i would even have tried to push them that hard if i had a new truck but in the old work truck i was willing to risk it i should also say that i use these for carrying plans and a 4 level both of which are lighter than a rifle or shotgun but i would hazard the guess that it sould support a firearm with no problem,92,95
4310,Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,4.0,positive,i have owned one of these before and i liked it alot especially made in united states it arrived on time but it was missing a carriage bolt and a wing nut hhhmmm i went to value home centers to pick that up other than that i would still buy another,47,96

4351,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,1.0,negative,these tabs are small and weak they do not attach well and simply sit in the track so they pull out easily if much force is applied if you have large screens or they are tight to fit look for something else,42,3
4352,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,1.0,negative,warning this one does not fit the screentight screen frames you will buy from homedepot or lower,16,4

4354,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,i used these tabs when i replaced some screens that had been in place for 20 years the screening material was easy to find at the local home depot but the tabs where nowhere to be found these have worked well with the charcoal colored screens that i used I am not particularly handy withstuff but these were easy enough to use it just took a bit of work to figure out which side of the screen to place them opposite the side where the spline is located and you need to work it a bit as it does make inserting the spline a tighter fit i used a 0140 spline with a standard screen the tabs make the insertion and removal of the screen much easier and so far they held very securely time will tell if they will get brittle as they age the one negative is that since they are a solid blackthey are noticeable my previous tabs were clear but then they got brittle over time and just broke when i tried to remove the screen,183,6
4355,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,very thin when you use the tabs to remove the screen they pop off the ones i used from lowes did not do this,24,7
4356,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,4.0,positive,these tabs are the dimension i need with a 1/4 inch projection into the spline channel these tabs are like the originals on my screens so they do the job and hopefully will last several years also a good price and quick delivery i wish however that somebody could come up with a better design that would be sturdier and easier to pull,63,8
4357,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,i bought this to replace old more than a decade and broken pull tabs on my window screens these are much flimsier than my old pull tabs but they do their job does not break off when pulled up to lift window screen,43,9
4358,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,these work well easy to use when replacing my window screens,11,10
4359,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,4.0,positive,my old screen frames had none or missing / broke off these did the trick it is a standard spline held pull tab nothing fancy would have been nice if the box came in an even number of tabs although kinda stuck with 1 extra that i can not do nothing with fast shipping time was greatveddy veddy gooooood laughing out loud,52,11
4360,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,2.0,negative,we take our window screens out each year for the winter we have been doing that for 10 years i got a 25-pack to replace tabs that occasionally snap off and these tabs break much much more often than the tabs that came on the original windows we have had the most problems with tab breakage in screens that have a lot of sun exposure so it may just be a uv thing just to be clear they are not pulling out due to installationissues these tabs split into two pieces the long part of the tab shears off and the remainder of the tab stays under the vinyl spline shopping for a better solution,116,12
4361,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000H5WN4O,5.0,positive,my local hardware store did not have these and i was replacing screens they work just fine for me but may not hold up as long as the oem,28,13

4363,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,i have been using this product for almost a year now initially everything looked perfect however the hand held shower unit is made of a poor quality plastic so is the tubing after 3 months of use the tubing ruptured because the metal framing around it had a sharp end which was not fixed properly and over time it cut the rubber i had to buy a new hose to replace the old one along with a new shower head after a while the connector between the shower head and the filter broke since it was plastic now i just have the filter from the original package but have a beautiful new shower head and hand held combo attached to the filter with a new metal connector hope the filter does not brake with the new shower set,138,1
4364,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,where to start first issue my order was forgotten about and never shipped to me i will say that after i contacted the seller via email they did respond promptly and ship myout including a free water filter second issue the bath ball filters handle broke w / n the first use third issue the shower filter was not even on for a week before the tubing w / n it burst please do not purchase either of these items,77,2
4365,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,this is the best hand-held shower head i have head so far the filter is great my skin is smoother and my hair much much softer whenever i take a shower at the gym now with unfiltered water i feel the difference the chrome is beautiful no more chlorine smell and now with the hand-held i can wash my hair without getting in the bathtub nice,66,3
4366,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,i grew up in new york and absolutely never gave a second thought to the quality of our water my hair was always soft manageable and shiny then i moved to the midwest where i found the hardest water in the united states it clanks as it comes out of the tap you have to use a chisel to remove the residue from your counters it leaves my hair dirty-looking stringy dull and flat water softeners do not do a thing to help even moving to a neighborhood with so-called city water is no improvement i tried every type of shampoo and conditioner tried rinsing my hair in rainwater i collected in a barrel that worked a bit although it can be quite a shock in the winter and concocted a vinegar rinse finally i purchased the crystal quest with it is super-duper filter not only is my hair soft and manageable again but my skin feels much better too it was easy to install and works great if you live in an area with hard water treat yourself and get one of these handheld showers,183,4
4367,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,this is a good product the advantage is it leaves your skin feeling smooth and moist i actually feel clean when i get out of the shower city water tends to irritate my skin even while i am showering the extension on it allows for easy clean up of your shower and makes washing your pets 100 easier it also has an off switch on the shower head which helps when your trying to lather your dog without turning the water competely off the only disadvantage is changing the direction of the filter every couple of weeks i would like to have a shower head filter that i can install and leave of course i would still have to change the filter either way you decide to take is up to you all filters need maintenance overall this is a good product for the price you pay,147,5
4368,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,my hair is softer is it the new shampoo i used or the filtered water my hair is so soft that i can not help playing with it my husband has extreme dry skin he put cream over all in the morning by evening he has suffering from the itchy dry skin again so bad that i wish he could put cream on during the day now he does not need to put extra cream in the evening,76,6
4369,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,5.0,positive,my hair is better now that i started using this it was really gross feeling before i know that is vague but i always felt like i had gunk in it before,31,7
4370,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,not only does it filter the bad stuff from your shower water but the design gives you a nice steady well dispersed stream of water,25,8
4371,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,water comes out slow and it faster to wash yourself in the sink do not buy thisit is the bad,22,9
4372,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,there was no way to make this shower head stop leaking and leaking badly it had a funny looking head and it had little water pressure i replaced it with one that was cheaper and easier to install and has never leaked i also find the company and it is associates to be disreputable they promised me my return shipping because they did not origionally send what i had ordered but after having fun at my expense and doing what i could to resolve the situation i was left with them owing me money i do not recommend this product or this company,101,10
4373,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,bought this and was working well for a few months about the 4th month started toand could tell the filter was not working properly due to smelling chlorine again in shower called crystal quest directly they said they would send me out a new unit that was over 2 months ago tried to work with this seller said they would get back with me the next day it is been over a week and still have not heard anything back from the seller or crystal quest this was really the worst customer service I have experienced next time would buy a different brand just to ensure proper customer service,108,11
4374,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,kind of disappointed with the quality of the all plastic unit will go out and purchase different shower head later the hose still will not behave itself need more flexible supply hose filter works great living in the nw whenever we get our torrential rains the water services pump up the chlorine and being somewhat allergic to it the filter takes care of the smell and irritation,66,12
4375,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,1.0,negative,i bought this product a year and a half ago i have had to get new parts for it several different times already now it keeps breaking because it is made of cheap plastic a type of styrene which is toxic btw after 1 year they would not send me replacement parts so now i am stuck with a broken showerhead that i can either keep buying parts for from crystal quest or i can find another showerhead that does not break all the time anyone have any showerhead filter recommendations i am so dissapointed in this showerhead such a waste of money and it is been a hassel having to write to crystal quest every 5 or so months it seems to get something replaced not at all environmentally friendly either i do not know why they can not just make it of metal i would certainly buy it if it was metal it would not be breaking all the time and would not have the plastic / styrene concern either did not like the customer service from crystal quest either,172,13
4376,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4.0,positive,i live in chicago where the city water is hard i purchased this showerhead with some reservations because of the previous reviews so far i am very pleased with the product the showerhead does give you increased water pressure resulting in a more powerful and cleaner shower experience less residue my skin scalp and hair is less dryer than before the installation process was easy and quick no dripping or leaks the filter seems to work great you do have to reverse the filter on occasion this product is mostly affordable due to the long filter life up to one year one negative the showerhead only has 3 or 4 water settings most have 5 settings in this price range,120,14
4377,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,worth the easy to install frnkly it not any harder installing one of these compared to a garden hose outside your house,23,0
4378,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,this is a pretty good sprayer but the plastic button soon leaks needs washer kits often so be prepared to buy them in quantity if you have like me several sprayers the positive is the excellent lifetime warranty and service by kohler customer service i wish they made one with less plastic and better designed button i have had to replace 2 with buttons leaking or coming off and was sent prompt replacement,73,1
4379,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,first of all in case you are wondering the spray head is plastic with a brass coating the photo and info is vague on this the hose from the spray head is unwieldy for the spray head and causes the spray head to have problems when trying to seat i put a weight on it under the sink outside of that it does the job and is better than the one i replaced,72,2
4380,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,this spray is pretty good quality for a replacement kitchen spray it looks good is a decent weight and was fairly easy to install my only complaint is that it did not come with a weight to keep the hose tucked neatly underneath the sink without that weigh the hose can sometimes be a little tricky to put back under the sink but it is not too big a deal overall i am happy with the product,76,3
4381,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,only one star from me first the quality of construction is no different from generic home store quality so forget the kohler quality equation looks substantial but it is only looks just chromed plastic second the force of the spray is weak suspect this is either the number of holes with too much volume per hole either reduce the number or make them smaller and yes it is the sprayer because the previous unit worked fine maybe mine was a fluke on the strength of stream so suggest buy locally and install before the return window is gone just in case,101,4
4382,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,i ordered this because it was kohler well I am very disappointed the only well made part was the hose the handle and piece connected to the hose are plastic very cheaply made would definantely not recommend,36,5
4383,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,mediocre quality fitting on sprayer handle loosened after a few months and started leaking under the sink tightened it up and thestopped for now,26,6
4384,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,i just bought two of these spray heads unfortunately why two because since this spray head was installed only two years ago it is already broken twice parts springing out no fixing it while it is out of commission so is our sink because it diverts the water from the faucet therefore i bought two assuming it will only be a matter of months before it breaks again and it is a big deal not to be able to use the kitchen sink when this happens very disappointed in kohler and have already told the design / build firm that redesigned our kitchen to never use this sprayer tried to replace with another brand but the sizing was such we had to replace with this one sigh,121,7
4385,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,i bought this to repair a pedicure chair and it worked great,12,8
4386,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,nice sprayer but wished it was not made of plastic expected something a little better from kohler,16,9
4387,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,i purchased this to replace the original sprayer on my kohler kitchen faucet pros looks good installs easily better connection than the previous design it replaces old version had tendency towhere the hose met the handle cons the only thing i do not like better than the previous model is that the water pressure is not quite as strong through the sprayer,62,10
4388,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,i bought two of these the first lasted a year before the handle shot off and water sprayed all over my kitchen ceiling i ordered a replacement a few weeks ago and after installing it today found that it leaks now i need to return it and find another option,50,11
4389,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,i ordered this sprayer because it was the only one in thei needed i was not positive of thebut ordered it anyway yes it is the muted gold tone / brushed brass or whatever you want to call it but it matches my faucet perfectly I am not crazy about the push button in the front of the sprayer because I have never had one before and it is taking a little getting used to but at least it is the rightand it works fine my husband said it installed perfectly easily,92,12
4390,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,excellent product works better than expected should be double the cost so was quite surprised my spouse likes it is looks and the way it operates much better than the original that came with the sink,35,13
4391,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,this kohler sidespray is a total piece of junk it may look like it is made out of metal but it is chrome-plated plastic so it will not last and will easily break the spray button has a very soft spring and is poorly located so when you grab it to use you often get a random spray you do not want finally the way the sprayer attaches to the hose is very stupid it is constantly coming unscrewed and leaking water ugh,81,14
4392,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1.0,negative,bought it in may by december the hose kinked where the spray is attached can not use standard hose have to throw it away junk,24,15
4393,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,ili likedtthe retro design but it leaked we installed it and water continuosly dripped from the sprayer head the base felt like cheap plastic disapointing,25,16
4394,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,my last sidespray had the button fall off and searching for a replacement was harder then i thought i would be it did not seem like any of the large hardware stores had the sprayer by itself this one was the same brand as my sink / faucet and complimented the faucet perfectly in fact i like the look of this one a lot more then the one that originally went with the faucet and it works great,75,17
4395,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2.0,negative,i looks good and installs easy but like someone else mentioned the pressure is miserable i would not recommend this to anyone,21,18
4396,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4.0,positive,this is a nice looking sidespray it matches my brushed stainless steel sink the nozzle pivots where it meets the hose which i like as it feels a little more maneuverable than the cheaper fixed nozzle-hose connections,37,19
4397,Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5.0,positive,thank god i could find this to replace the broken one apparently shiny brass is outlawed at home product stores the cost was reasonable considering my other choices would not have matched this old house,35,20
4413,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,bought this for a 9 year old boys birthday party it was a real hit my son loved it so much he hated to bash it open very nice looking good quality well maybe too good quality it took many many hits before even started to bust open but it kept the kids busy and they had a blast finally had an adult give it a good bash to drop all the goodies,72,0
4414,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,the pinata arrived in the time specified by the seller it looked just like the picture was well put together my nephew had a knight themed birthday party and the pinata was perfect for it the kids had a great time slaying the pinata,44,1
4415,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,we bought this for our sons 6th birthday knights was the theme all the kids loved taking their turn but it was king dad who had to slay the dragon with his pocket knife we could not get it open the head came off but not at the candy opening it arrived very quickly and was packed great great price too,60,2
4416,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,this was a great pinata and a wonderful addition to our princess / castle themed party the party was for my 3 year old daughter but i wanted to have something her older brothers and cousin could enjoy so i got them swords and they slayed the dragon pinata it did not hold a lot of loot so i began throwing more stuff on to the ground once he was broken open overall a very cool pinata,74,3
4417,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,i thought it looked a little odd upon arrival but my children assurred me it was great sure enough the kids at the birthday party thought it was a cool pinata it was not very easy to break open but i had the candy packed in tightly,46,4
4418,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,i ordered this pinata for my sons birthday party in which we were making a movie it arrived in plenty of time for the party we used it for a scene where all the kids were knights battling a dragon and it worked out fine i gave it slightly lower marks for durability because it ended up breaking at the neck instead of bursting open but that was fine we saved the head and used it to add in shots later with water shooting out of the mouth with the garden hose making it look like the dragon was shooting water at the knights lots of fun i would buy it again if i was doing another similar party,119,5
4419,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,thiswas ordered on september 27 2008 for my grandsons birthday party held on october 11 2008 thewas received by my daughter from the vendor on october 23 2008 it took almost a month to receive it which was past the date of the party the expected ship date was not to exceed twelve days which would have been october 9 2008 i called the vendor on october 9 2008 and i received no clear explanation for the delay as a result i will never order from this vendor ever again,94,6
4420,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,pinata was badly mangled and folded into a ball wings are broken head is pushed in product is almost completely unusable,21,7
4421,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,this came completly folded in half and a super small box it was ripped crushed in and had creases from being folded only reason not 1 star is because i still filled it with candy and kids continued to detroy it,39,8
4422,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,the dragon pinata arrived a little smaller than expected but that was not the problem it was packed terribly as a result the wings were bent backwards and will not stay open one foot and it is mouth arrived ripped I am very disappointed,40,9
4423,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,the dragon piata was really cute and helped make our party more fun,13,10
4424,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,need to use smaller type candy like starbursts and tootsie roll size worked great at 6 year olds birthday party,20,11
4425,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,very cute makes a great decoration but a terrible piata could maybe hold two handfuls of candy,17,12
4426,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,broke in half with the first kiddo hitting a 3 year old so disappointed move on to a different vendor,20,13
4427,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,it was beautiful fun and delivered quickly thank you,9,14
4428,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,the head broke off after only 2 children went through the line we had very disappointed children at our party,20,15
4429,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,good cost-effective pinata not a lot of room inside so do not buy if you are planning on cramming more than a couple big fist-fulls of stuff inside but if you need a cheap dragon pinata and you need it fast was prime when i bought it then this is your go-to,50,16
4430,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,where the body and head connect is so flimsy that it only lasted 2 kids looked cool but was useless,20,17
4431,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,i wish there was more information about the capacity of this otherwise i never would have bought it knowing how small it actually is do not hold your breath if you think you can fit 2 pounds of candy in here because you can not a little sad that with all the kids coming to my daughters birthday that they have got a pinata with hardly any candy in it i barely got 2 105 oz bags of little snickers twix milky way and more in there i was going to put cute little pencil erasers in there too but i can not fit anymore in it disappointing also does not look much like the picture even after i tried straightening it is body out,117,18
4432,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,the pi ata is exactly as described and i am well pleased with this purchase,14,19
4433,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,we ended up liking it so much that we pulled the candy back out and kept it around unbashed easily the coolest pinata we have bought the only downside is the small belly so it can not hold much candy but it is so cool that we do not care,46,20
4434,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,i agree that the body cavity is a little on the small side but overall i found this pinata to be really cute and the quality of it is as i expected it i feel that it is a reasonable price for what you are getting we are using this pinata as a jabberwocky for my stepdaughters alice in wonderland themed party after i hung it up for a couple of days he straightened out nicely i did not have the issue of it being crushed or broken as some have said i mean it is a paper dragon that you are going to bust with a stick for the price and for it is purpose i think that it is a great buy,120,21
4435,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,not good quality the wings look weird and do not stay open there has pieces without the black paper so it looks unfinished the part that holds candy is very small so does not hold much i would return if i had more time before my sons party very disappointed,47,22
4436,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,it is definitely small but i like that as it took just the right amount of candy,17,23
4437,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,no indication of a hole to actually put candy in it,11,24
4438,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,this came all squished the wings arm and legs are stuck to the body if i pry them open the cardboard will rip does not hold much mostly small candies like tootsie rolls,32,25
4439,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,this is an awesome looking dragon using it as the enderdragon for my sons minecraft party a little small will not hold a ton of candy but overall a great purchase,30,26
4440,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,worked great for my sons 1st birthday knight party he loved sleighing his first dragon was a bit hard to stuff and t here was not much room for goodies,29,27
4441,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,the wings do not stay up so i have to fix them also the photo looks much better than the real thing i can not return it because we have a ninja party all the ninja pinatas are out of stock,40,28
4442,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,this was the highlight of the entire knights of the round table birthday party it was well constructed and easy to fill a perfect addition,25,29
4443,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,got this pinata for my sons birthday party when it arrived the package and the pinata was damaged we did not have the time to get a new one because of how long it took to get thisso we figure it was going to be beat up anyway it only took one hit and the head went flying off plus this thing was very small tryed to contact the seller and was told there has nothing they would do i would buy anything else but this peace of junk,90,30
4444,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,thisdid not look as nice as the picture presents it will the colors were dull thewas smaller than i expected it looked wimpy i was embarrassed to bring it to the party so i went out and bought a more expensive looking piata from a local store,51,31
4445,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,bought this for my sons 9 year birthday party to go with pokemon theme i thought it would at least be something different but it is very flimsy the head broke off at the neck after the second try kid a 4 year old girl hit it with the stick had to re-tie it up to continue the game without the head and then that did not even last for a couple more players most kids did not even get a turn it was a disappointment and i actually had kids crying because they did not get to a turn to hit it booo,101,32
4446,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,very nice use it for my son party holds a good amount of candy and very sturdy,18,33
4447,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,great product my son loved hacking away at it with his friends with the homemade wooden sword i made after everyone got a shot at it my son chopped it is head off on his second try it took about 8 hits total before it broke open the only part i was disappointed about was that the candy did not fly everywhere like you see in the movies some candy flew out enough to distract the children so that i could rip it apart a little more and get all of the candy out,92,34
4448,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,i ordered this 1 week before my 4 year old sons knights and dragons birthday party with the two day shipping from amazon prime it was on my doorstep two days later i was definitely impressed with the processing speed the pi ata was a roaring success we uswd it first as a party decoration the kids enjoyed screaming and running away from it during their make believe play the red wingspan was perfectly frightening most of all the kids had a blast fighting the dragon we had seven 3 - 5 year olds striking with foam swords and it lasted two rounds before succumbing to the knights determination all kids got a few good shots twice so props to the production for making it the perfect balance between sturdy and vulnerable and just fyi the sweet spot to hit is the bottom of the belly this was worth the money and was by far the best decoration and activity at the party,160,35
4449,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,very cheap feel like you could almost break it when moving it around,12,36
4450,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,is not 19 inches tall as described asked for refund and all they give you is excuses and run around,21,37
4451,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,it worked for about two kids with a couple of swings each it broke at the neck but below where it was suspended it served it is purpose and help candy until it broke i can not really fault something for breaking when it was designed to break and made to be hit with a baseball bat it was pretty cool and we had fun making the dragon attack the kids trying to hit it,73,38
4452,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,when my son turned 10 the topon his list was a piata literally at the top of his list so he got his piata we broke 3 ropes holding the piata up before the piata allowed itself to be beaten to smithereens and all the boys had a great time,52,39
4453,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,it was really small but the children enjoyed it,9,40
4454,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,lasted long enough to be fun for the kids to whack at it for a while,16,41
4455,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,sadly this is a terribly designed piata we bought it for my sons 8th birthday he is an average to small size kid and it broke with his 1st swing imagine the disappointment of 10 kids who also wanted a swing at it unless you plan totape it before use i would not recommend,55,42
4456,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,such a cute pinata for a dragon themed party broke on neck with one swing due to the way it is constructed so that was a little disappointing,27,43
4457,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,he is a little doofy looking in the picture and he has even more so in real life do not get me wrong i love that i did not have to try and make one his face just seems a little wonky is all he held about 80 pieces of candy and he took quite a beating before the kids finally got their candy i would say he has good quality family entertainment,69,44
4458,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,from the picture and other information describing the product i was expecting it to have more space inside to put candy we used miniature candy bars and i could only get about 20 pieces inside the product was made very cheap and when i moved it i was afraid it was going to fall apart my three year old took the first swing at the pinata with a plastic baseball bat and it cracked open right away therefore not leaving many swings left for the other children i would not recommend purchasing this pinata for an older childs birthday party,100,45
4459,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,nice pinata but the only thing is that it is too small did not hold much candy,16,46
4460,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,very cute but very little room for goodies broke very quickly when hit by 4 year olds,17,47
4461,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,not what i was expecting the thing is tiny barely holds any candy it came all smashed up i had to glue the wings eyes and not sure what to do with the tail it is totally bent out of shape I am so embarrassed to hang this up if i had time to get another one i would when i saw this online it reminded me of the ender dragon from minecraft my son is so into that right now i figured I had surprise him so sad,83,48
4462,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,big it was nice and took a while to break,10,49
4463,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,hit it 3 times and busted open looks cool,9,50
4464,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,piata was great except it was broke when i got it it was sent in a bag should have been sent in a box so it was protected,28,51
4465,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,my pinata was broken the neck was half torn one of the wings was torn not happy at all was not worth it at all and the prize not worth the size,32,52
4466,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,this piata lasted about 10 little kid hits before it was literally sliced in half by a 4 year old when it arrived the wings were flopping down so we had to use wire to get them to sit up like in the picture there was not much room in the body for filling so we had to poke a small hole in the head to get more stuff in on the positive side it did look nice once we had it stuffed and full of goodies it was just disappointing that it broke so easily,95,53
4467,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,the entry point on mine was not really clear because the plastic seal was missing but the back of the neck had a weak joint which i used to fill with candy i also used construction paper to make flames it was very nice,43,54
4468,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,the piata was just too small did not hold very much candy and it got flattened during the shipping process disappointed,20,55
4469,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,the piata was okay it was much smaller than expected and did not hold much candy it did ship quickly and looked similar to picture,24,56
4470,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,broke open after 4 swings fun for our first piata easy to fill and our birthday boy and guests really enjoyed having something different,24,57
4471,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,the dragon piata that i received was different from the one that was pictured it was similar but still not what i thought i would receive will not be ordering from them again,33,58
4472,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,this is a good pinyata but i wish it had more room inside for candy i had to rip extra room in the tail and head to fit all the candy i bought for it but other than that it look great and the kids loved the dragon pinyata,49,59
4473,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,coolestever worth it used this for my daughters disney evil villains party as malifacent and it was a big hit,22,60
4474,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,took only one hit and fell apart very sad birthday party kids and disappointed parents not only is it really too small it almost ruined my sons birthday thankfully we had a backup piata,34,61
4475,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,adorable the kids loved slaying the dragon and reaping the rewards of candy and trinkets from the dragons belly would recommend,21,62
4476,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,a lot cheaper than if i would have gotten from a party store worked great for our knight and princess themed party it was even slayed by a knight and shipped quickly,32,63
4477,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,this was perfect for our sons birthday party plenty of room to stuff with candy and it was made of very good quality and actually took many hits to crack open,31,64
4478,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,bought it for my sons birthday party all the kids had a blast with it it went really well with the how to train your dragon theme,27,65
4479,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,we are evidently spoilt by the pinatas we have had in mexico which are made from papier mache that is set as hard as concrete the black dragon is cute read pretty small but the main issue was the strength we had 6 kids at the party and the first one did all the damage the rest of the kids never got a chance to give it a whack which caused more grief than we needed we will not be buying this again,84,66
4480,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,my son and his friends really enjoyed this pinata my only complaint is that the tag said it had strings for the kids to pull to get the candy to come out but there were no strings we ended up using a drum stick to break it open,48,67
4481,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,i choose this rating because it broke after the third swing by two small eight year old boys it is very small save your and double up on brown bags and use that as a pinata old school that way everyone can take a turn to swing seller did have fast shipping although,52,68
4482,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,we ordered this for my 5 year olds party this pinata was cute and exactly as it looks in the picture however after three direct hits from a 5 year old the pinata snapped right off at the neck not to mention it holds very little candy because it is so narrow not your best option,56,69
4483,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1.0,negative,just received it today i have never seen such a small pinyata nothing will fit in this big regret quality is okay but big disappointment size,26,70
4484,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4.0,positive,i bought this dragon pinata because of the amazon reviews i read and the price it was about 18 when i purchased it around 10 - 15 cheaper than other dragon pinatas i had seen the reviews were mostly all positive so perhaps i had high expectations when i received the pinata some of the colored paper on the dragon was loose and the wings were bent terribly I am sure this could have been prevented had it been shipped in a larger box there was no way to fit it in the box they used without breaking it is wings aside of that it was a sturdy well made pinata,107,71
4485,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,i bought this pinata for my sons 5th birthday and he loved it in fact he loved it so much he did not want to destroy it so we had to take all the candy out of it and now the dragon hangs in his room my other two sons love it also it was a good deal the wings and the tail were squished a little during shipping and the wings did not stick out like it does on the picture but i would buy it again,86,72
4486,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2.0,negative,the black dragon shaped pinata is cute and pretty durable i bought two of these at the same time one did not come with a nylon loop to hang it with had i bought one first i would not have bought another i would not recommend this to friends looking for pinatas the wholeof a pinata is to be able to stuff it with lots of candy for kids this is the smallest pinata i have ever seen you also can not stuff candy / toys in the dragons head well this is almost half of the pinata the recommendation is to only stuff 2 lbs of candy in it i do not know how you could stuff more in there the candy also needs to be small so you can pack as much as possible in it for the 2 - 4 kids it will satisfy it also does not stand up as in the picture you have to hang it i had my soccer team beat this thing to a pulp then gave them a pre-bagged bag of candy afterwards as they each did not get very much i think this was designed by a dentist,190,73
4487,Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5.0,positive,i was seeking a durable dragon pinata and this is perfect we used the pinata a little differently my three year old was not blindfolded he slayed the dragon as part of his birthday party so i wanted one that could take a few well placed hits before smashing,49,74
4488,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5.0,positive,the game consists of about 40 stages as far as I am aware starts off fairly easy and picks up in difficulty as you progress it can get a bit repetitive at times however since you can use different units in different ways to take our your targets it keeps it to a minimum for the most part you will also probably want to repeat stages so you can gather items to equip your minions with more powerful equipment pretty fun I had definitely recommend it,83,0
4489,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5.0,positive,not sure why there are a lot of hateful reviews here but I am really enjoying this game the soundtrack and sound are great and the gameplay is really addictive and very similar to that of pikmin it is even created by the same team upgrading your units is fun and keeps me coming back i have not beaten it yet but I have put a few hours in and I am sure it will be expanded even further with dlc in the future also multiplayer the worlds look great but the actual characters are a little lacking in detail compared to other vita games but the gameplay is fast and fluid and that is what matters most to me i picked this game up for 30 on a lightning deal and i think that is the sweet spot for it,134,1
4490,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2.0,negative,this game is ok for the first half but then the areas get cheap there are electric fences and fire traps that are almost impossible to avoid the games difficulty does not increase due to a need for the players skill to increase but rather the game introduces cheaper tricks and tactics in each new level and due to limited control of your army the game becomes very frustrating i do not recommend this game instead invest your money in one of the other excellent launch titles like uncharted rayman mutant blobs attack or escape plan,95,2
4491,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5.0,positive,a great game to play on the vita one of best stragey game i played I am glad i got it for my vita,23,3
4492,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1.0,negative,i purchased this game when i preordered my ps vita i should have waited this game minus well be an app for a smart phone a free one at that i believe it is a great concept yet nothing else went into this game you have minimal control it is basically a one button does all action game except for movement i assure you you will be disappointed with it luckily the gamestop i purchased it at let me return it for a preorder of unit 13 so far I have been extremely happy with my vita and all the games i have uncharted wipe-out ninja gaiden and dungeon hunter this game was an extreme disappointment if you are planning on purchasing it wait til it goes down in price I am sure you will easily be able to get a pre-owned version any day now i believe most people who made the mistake i did of purchasing it will be trading it in very soon if they are not able to return it ultimately it is your decision although i believe the majority of ps vita owners will have serious buyers remorse,192,4
4493,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4.0,positive,each levels kind of repetitive but it is an awesome game good to plan a pinch when you do not have much time to play through a whole game,27,5
4494,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4.0,positive,nice little addition specially since it does not take up precious space in the memory card,15,6
4495,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1.0,negative,garbage waste of money graphics are so sloppy controls are terrible gameplay is not fun characters are so small on the screen everything blurs together,25,7
4496,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4.0,positive,i loved it i got it very quicky and it was great the music is amazing and the game is fun,21,8
4497,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1.0,negative,do not waste your money this game is absolutely terrible my understanding is that the game makers are struggling to come out with games that can be played on the vita but this is a game that could have been skipped in the development process the graphics are ok the controls are easy the concept is cheesy,57,9
4498,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2.0,negative,this game is for no reason bad but it is not the best of it is kind either if your really want this type of game play play the pikmin series score6/10 mediocre,31,10
4499,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2.0,negative,i got this on the cheap when i first bought my vita and was very disappointed the graphics are crud and the gameplay is not very good in addition to that there are only a few music tracks and they repeat over and over again,44,11
4500,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5.0,positive,i love this game the music is great and the game is fun shipped fast and well packaged it is just what i was looking for,25,12
4501,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4.0,positive,overall i like the game the theme is dark and humorous right up my irreverent alley i picked it up on sale for 20 and i feel it is worth that price pros the soundtrack is all metal fun semi-mindless game play the goblins reactions to things are fun cons repetitive not much strategy involved,55,13
4502,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2.0,negative,between the thrash music and monotonous control it is like being in the army corp of he shall to be sure this game has no real replay value and is slogging to make it through the first time,36,14
4503,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1.0,negative,for something called army corps of he shall i expected this to be a great action game but this game truly does not live up to it is name as it is a square enix game and 2012 i thought the graphics and gameplay would be that much more enhanced as they have created some of the most memorable games to date not a game full of intense action as it is name implies i was bored within the first twenty minutes of playing,81,15
4504,Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5.0,positive,good game long but beatable never seams boring but some times repetitive completely original style and game play like no other game,22,16
