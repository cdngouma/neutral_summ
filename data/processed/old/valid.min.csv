140,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,takes less than a second to install and works beautifully keeping any spills from the stove on top of the product instead of falling down onto the cabinet and stove i have a white stove and countertops so it also looks great too i like the l-shaped design which is magnatized so it clings to the side of the stove great product,62,0
141,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,i really like the design of these guards they are l-shaped rather than the other t shaped ones that i have seen the advantage to this design is that your stovetop does not need to be exactly level with your counters for these to work the vertical magnetized side adheres the the side of your stove and the horizontal part rests on top of your counter i have had no problems with the magnets as described by the other reviewer i think the quality of thisis very good,90,1
142,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,the manetic strip separated from the plastic after a couple of days so you see the magnet against the stove this is a piece of junk,26,2
143,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,the magnets hold the strips against the stove so it does not slide around also there is a little play on the height of the stove and counter so strips can go up or down to compensate,36,3
144,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,placed it between therange and the adjacent countertop per instructions good fit after i trimmed about 3/4 off the length to fit my counters after less than one month while frying up a batch of fresh wild mushrooms one night the dang thing melted and warped a goodbut poor choice of materials it needs a higher-temperature resistant plastic it is being used next to a stove fer cryin out loud,74,4
145,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,what a greatstops crumbs grease and more from slipping into the cracks and keeps clean up at a minimal easy to install and keep clean wish i had thought of it sooner,33,5
146,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,they do not fit between my stove and new cabria stone counter top so now using along the side of the deep freezer and the wall so dust bunnies stay out of the,33,6
147,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,the first time i cooked with this on one of the sides warped but i was able to bend it back a bit the second time the magnet started to stick melt to the stovetop and pulled away from the further-warping plastic there has still a bit of melted magnet residue on the side of my stove this is not appropriate for actual use on a stove-top while cooking maybe for looks but not for use waste of money wish i could rate it 0 stars,84,7
148,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,works fine for what it was designed to do especially like the longer length the magnetic strip keeps it in place,21,8
149,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,thought the magnet would be great they are generic magnets not neodymium i did not think about the plastic needing to be heat resistant duh for myrange the plastic seems to be polystyrene they melted / warped the first time i used a large skillet and high er power i ended up buying silicone typefillers they work fine and are much cheaper,63,9
150,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,fit perfect cover my husbands mess up oops laughing out loud,9,10
151,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,4,positive,it is worked really well at keeping liquids and crumbs from going in between the stove and counter i have really big gaps between them although so i think it would hold up better if that were not the case the magnet strip has come unglued from the plastic which is annoying but i think were my gaps smaller it would have a harder time of doing so but they are still working,72,11
152,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,the website description does not have information about it is material thickness and it is critical since you have to slide it isinto thebetween counter-top and cabinet it only says the length / width / height of the product in my case both edges can not fit into the gaps because it is too thick so it should have this thickness information,59,12
153,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,solved the problem of changing out a glide in stove with free standing with granite countertops the fit was not exact and the extenders solved the problem,27,13
154,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,save your money these warped within just a few months and made them useless the fit was never very good from the beginning,23,14
155,Appliances,B0027E3FCC,2,negative,the plastic warps i had to shim it so hide the heat warps would have bought the metal ones but stupid amazon would not ship them to canada,28,15
493,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,some of the pens exploded and got ink everywhere so i had to return them they also felt very cheaply made in my hand like they would snap if i held them too tightly so i did not purchase another pack,41,0
494,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,all but one of the pens work well one of the purple pens is unfortunately already dried out the triangular shape makes for easy storage and allows for a better more comfortable grip,33,1
495,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,fine product good transaction a couple of pens seemed a little dry otherwise i would have rated the product 5 stars overall happy with the purchase,26,2
496,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,so disappointed in these markers one was completely dry two barely work several are scratchy and one broke apart the first time i uncapped it and ink got all over the place i feel like i got a different set of markers than those in all the reviews i read before purchasing i will never buy these again,58,3
497,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,love this i use this for my planner to doodle u have alot of different colors to play with it does not bleed through paper,26,4
498,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i bought these to go along with a coloring book of very intricate mandalas so i needed pens or markers that could handle the tiny details of the pictures the fine tips on these pens are fantastic and the colors do not bleed out through the paper plenty of different colors to choose from as well good purchase,57,5
499,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,this is the 3rd batch of markers i received 2day where all the blue ones are dried out weird i guess I am not supposed 2 use blue laughing out loud,28,6
500,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,they work ok they came in fast like 2 or 3 of the pin did not work,17,7
501,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,i got these because they were cheap artist inkers and i wanted to test them out i open the case to find out that the pens were dryed out the tips on some broke off and the caps insides fall apart i say do not ever buy these because they will waste your money,53,8
502,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,tips were broken and several were dried up,8,9
503,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,bought them as a gift recipient was very pleased,9,10
504,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,got these for college went to work on my homework and the grey and light yellow does not work i have not used all the colors yet but now i have to order new ones not happy,37,11
505,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i ordered 2 of these for christmas gifts only some of the pens worked i was past the return date so stuck with them the ones that worked are great,30,12
506,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,first off these are fine tipped markers not pens secondly I have never experienced drawing with something that does not remotely match theof the cap it is like a surprise every time the light colors are dark the five different greens are all roughly the samethe yellows are orange or green and they have run out quickly on the plus side the case is nice and i like the triangular shape and the price was cheap,76,13
507,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the colors are all vibrant 1 of the markers may have had abut after inspecting each and every single one i could not find d it but oh well i love them,33,14
508,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love these i wish i had found them sooner thy arrived before the date that was given i use them for school and also for coloring I have had them for over a month and all the colors are still vibrant and i have not had any issues with the ink not drying fast enough,54,15
509,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,very disappointing these are not thethat the cap says they are at all,15,16
510,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,mis-advertised these are in no way shape or form gel pens they are markers they have fine points and work well as markers but they are not gel pens which is what i was expecting when i ordered them markers can not be blended no glitter and all the colors are extremely dark would not order again,56,17
511,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,nice colors and good for details but i did break the tip of one already by applying too much pressure,20,18
512,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,they have an incredibly cheap feel and are not gel as advertised i will be returning them,17,19
513,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,half of these are already dried out plus the colors do not match lids i picked up a yellow one and thewas deep orange,25,20
514,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i really liked the pens they were nice for a while i used them only for a school year if that is a while but some of the colors dry out faster than others once a pen has been bent or split there has no going back that was the only sad part about these pens,54,21
515,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these are a very nice fine tipped pen work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in there are plenty of colors but i did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper there was only 1 pen that i had any issue with and it was a light green which did not bother me that much since i do not use a lot of the lighter green colors but by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let thedrop and i have not had any issue since the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing the colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you will not lose them anywhere i am attaching a copy of a picture that i am working on right now using these pens for the linework the wording is done with a marker i received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review,203,22
516,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i bought these to use for adult coloring books and a lot of people end up using colored pencils but i wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick is a great variety of colors and it is very sharp clear bright pigmentation I had recommend this to anybod so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book I am not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I shall probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23
517,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i like the colors but when i received them one of the pen exploded and was a mess,18,24
518,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i like the fine line it draws however three of the markers were dried up before i even got to use them disappointing and i probably will not buy their product again,32,25
519,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these are nice pens very fine point they are great for tiny details however they do not blend well when you fill something in you can see each individual line each time you cover over the same area it gets darker due to the fine tip i would not recommend for anything larger however they are great colors and nice quality,61,26
520,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,good set of coloring pens but colors are not as bright as i thought they would be,16,27
521,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,nice pens i wanted a fine line marker to use with my silhouette machine for drawing and writing sentiments these worked perfect they have a pretty good range of colors the nibs are nice and strong also and draw a nice fine line,43,28
522,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,unfortunately these claimed to be gel pens when i purchased them they were not they are fine point markers had i wanted fine point markers these would been marvelous but not what i wanted mis-marked not what i was looking for no good for adult coloring books,45,29
523,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,when i received these 3 had leaked since then quite a few more have also love the ones that are useable,21,30
524,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,tiny markers but not gel pens useful but not what i expected,12,31
525,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these were pretty good markers they are fine tip and theydecently some colors are basically the same shade but other than that i had no problem they arrived quickly and I have had them for almost a year now,39,32
526,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,there has only one shade of red which is sad but a billion pinks and greens so that makes up for it,21,33
527,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,one of the pens blew up when i first used it i had to throw it away,17,34
528,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,great but one of the pens was leaking in the package when we got it,15,35
529,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,this pens i like so well the way thebut the tips on them do not last i used this set of pens twice and already i had to throw one away because of a bad tip and could not get any ink out and other one has a bad tip on it i was in the middle of a picture when it went bad i was very displeased,69,36
530,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,they come apart when you take the top off to use them a waste of money,16,37

533,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i ordered these to use on my ultra-intricate adult coloring books definitely a fine point works very well on tiny areas i recommend some larger or broader markers for bigger areas as these leave a rough texture to the paper when used toa larger space,47,40
534,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,very scratchy so i ended up giving them to my grandchildren i will not purchase again,16,41
535,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these fineliner gel sketch markers are of a very high quality and have nice bold colors the markers come in a wide array of colors in a reusable plastic container I have only had one markersince I have begun using them they are excellent for mixed media projects mandala colorings zen tangle journaling deconstructing books grocery lists i would not recommend them for huffing nor would they assist you in mentally cleaning out your fridge that is all,77,42
536,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i use these for coloring and they are great products the only down side is that the ink dries out a little too quickly so i have to tap the pen and move the ink around to help the flow,40,43
537,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,i was so excited for these pens to comes in and they worked great at first but i have not even finished coloring one page in my coloring book and my dark brown marker is dying i made sure to cap all my pens properly but it is still dying i expect pens to last more than a day,58,44
538,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,many of the colors appear very differently on paper than what you expect based on theof the cap,20,45
539,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,I am a teacher and i love my office supplies i could not wait to try these out they are definitely fine point and there was no running or bleeding as i drew colored and wrote with them i love the variety of colors that come in the pack as well i am excited to use them very similar to the rong thai fine point markers i tried them in a coloring book and because the pages are thick it did not bleed through but not sure i would use them for coloring i did receive this product to try out and review,99,46
540,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,love these got an adult coloring book and these work great for all those little details in those pictures i highly recommend these and can not beat the price also got them quicker than expected so that was nice,38,47
541,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,love these markers perfect for small details they write like pens and the colors are great,16,48
542,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,several of the markers do not workis not in the tip,10,49
543,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,my husband will be thrilled that he has colored markers specifically for drawing these are nice and they come in a hard case so they can travel with him wherever he goes,32,50
544,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love the container of these fineliner pens and the 24 colors are good although a couple of them are pretty close in tone to another still a good set for tiny spaces in adult coloring books,37,51
545,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,not good for adult coloring books they do not glide very well scratchy / dry might be better served for signing signatures or writing text but for coloring in you do not get a consistent fill some places are darker than others and those dark places bleed through was looking to try a new brand to diversify my range of colors i typically use stabilo but unfortunately will have to keep looking,70,52
546,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i love these pens i find that they do bleed through most paper unless it is a very heavy weight paper the colors are vibrant and i use them all the time,32,53
547,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these are the right pens to use with adult coloring books after trying pencils and coloring brush pens i found these work in the tight places the best i tried all of them to see if any were dried up and all were good true toas well you need to replace the lids so they snap on tight to keep them from drying up,66,54
548,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,these just arrived in the mail and at least one of them leaked as they are all covered in a bluish-purple ink theappears new as the blue is all over my hands now as well,37,55
549,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these pens are really awesome i used them when i was studying for my exams because i like for my notes to be colorful and organized my only problem was that a few of them dried out or ran out of ink very quickly i had hardly even used them it was only two or three in the pack that did this and the others still work great,68,56
550,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,using these for my adult coloring books and they are wondeful several coworkers plan to purchase the same product for their coloring books as well,25,57
551,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,terrible absolutely terrible 75 if them are dry they do not fill well very blotchy what an total waste of money,22,58
552,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,they are great for really tiny spaces but when it comes to bigger spaces you really have to take your sweet time,22,59
553,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,i recently bought these pens i have used them three times and four of them are already dry waste of money,21,60
554,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,i like the flow of these pens and they only barely bleed through a quality coloring book however the dark green was leaking from the bottom of the pen and was already all over the other pens when it arrived I am sure this was a fluke also for 24 colors a lot of these colors are so similar that it is like I am using the same colors over and over i would have liked more variety in the pack,78,61
555,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,nice markers lots of colors to choose from,8,62
556,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i ordered these to use in an adult coloring book they work perfectly for the extra fine lines that are in the book they do bleed through just a tiny bit so i have a piece of paper in between my pages they do not bleed through the lines for me like other markers did i can be very precise definitely recommend for any coloring or drawing that needs fine detail,70,63
557,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these pens are awesome i got them for coloring in adultbooks they are amazing for small areas,19,64
558,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,very good purchase the price was super they arrived on time prerfectly packed the colors are just as shown in the caps,22,65
559,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,received yesterday but why it is so dirty so dirty i required a new one for my friends gift i am very unsatisfied with this,26,66
560,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,returnedpens were dry after about 30 seconds of use,11,67

563,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,cheaply made and the there is a inkproblem,10,70
564,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,great pens nice thin tip to make smaller details to handwriting or journaling if you love colored pens or office supplies like me these are amazing,26,71
565,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,the pens were all leaking when i got them so i sent them back for a refund,17,72
566,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,horrible ink flow is blotchy and uneven and the tips of some of the pens are slightly frayed and too hard to make a nice smooth layer ofalso these are listed as pinkrise and they are plinrise for some unknown reason if you have arthritis or fibromyalgia the caps can be difficult to remove the triangular shape is pleasing to the hands although,65,73
567,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,some pens were already dry and unusable very disappointing got much better pens at michaels,16,74
568,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love to write and draw and i am always on the lookout for some great pens and markers i am so glad i got these pinkrise office colored fineliner sketch drawing pen fine point gel ink pen ink width 04mm set of 24 assorted colors they are very nice and come in a plastic case that seals nicely so when you are done you can put them away very neatly and not lose any of them and they write just wonderfully i am very picky about my pens and markers but could not find anything negative about these i absolutely love them i was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion i am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way i am just a regular amazon customer who shops a lot on amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision,157,75
569,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2,negative,like others said some where dried out when i received them and seem to run outfast,16,76

572,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,disappointed that some of the markers came dry,8,79
573,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,i love these markers i was worried about the quality and the price but identification buy them again i love them i was impressed with the size since i wanted extremely small markers and these nailed it,37,80
574,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the lid and the actualdid not always match but i just made achart in the flap of the book for comparison loved the markers over all,29,81
575,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,markers bleed all over my hands they run out of ink right after one use I am completely disappointed i would give them zero stars if there was an option for that i wish i could get my money back,41,82
576,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,was delivered very quickly the colors are great and the pens do not bleed across the page very pleased and would recommend to others,24,83
577,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,the triangular shape makes these easy to hold i like a finer tip but for what they are they are good,21,84
578,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,exactly what i wanted no problems with dried pens nice variety of colors super fast shipping i received my set 2 days after i ordered it happy with my purchase,30,85
579,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,not only are they dried up and yes i did shake them and wait a while to use them but some of the tips are split down the middle the colors on the caps are not even close to what the actual ink comes out,45,86
580,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,these are great for very detailed drawings the ink seems to stay consistent even after prolonged use also the barrel is triangular rather than round i found it a little awkward at first but it certainly did not cause any issues these would be a great gift for an artist or other creative type maybe paired with an art book regarding shipping i have prime and it arrived within 2 days,70,87
581,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,these pens work well but they run out of ink sooner than other brands,14,88
582,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,half the markers were dried out upon arrival waste of money,11,89
583,Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,really disappointing as a noise reducer no noticeable difference does diffuse the exhaust really not worth it,17,0
584,Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,does not block sound that much but it does reduce dust fits shop vacs,13,1
585,Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,thought i was looking for a filter but turned out it was a missing muffler on a friends wet dry vacuum did the job and returned to my friend with added bonus because she did not know it was missing,39,2
586,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this installs easily on the rigid vacuum exhaust port but that is about the only good thing about it it is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it i could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not it is a goodbut really does not work too well,60,3
587,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this product being advertised as a muffler is misleading i observed no difference in sound level i just completed my test it is being returned an effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac this is a viable option for my use since i will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective,77,4
588,Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,the listing for this muffler does not say what size hose it fits there are three sizes when i received it i realized it did not fit my vacuum,27,5
589,Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,my ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106db at 3 feet according to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a dead kennedys concert the muffler reduces that to 105 so maybe a wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler further using an unscientific stick to your face test I had say it reduces suction by about 15 so basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac if you need that and do not want to just tape a sock to the outlet click buy immediately i finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet now i can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her f-16,124,6
590,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,it is a muffler makes the shop vac quiet stays in place does not stick out too far one two three four,20,7
591,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,i did not need exhaust dispersion if i did i would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device to my knowledge none exist i wanted a muffler this does not muffle i took it back the end ps this site will not allow my zero star rating,45,8
592,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,this not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine does not blow air all over from the back of the machine it is a great addition for very little money we were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list,50,9
593,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,i was surprised to see that this muffler received 4 stars when i read the reviews praise was given not because it muffles sound but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust indeed this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my ridgid vacs i bought two of them but i was in a rush and got them locally when we are working on a job site there often is lots of dust imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in it also spreads the dust over an even greater area as other reviewers describe this muffler oh why not just call it air-diffuser redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle this greatly reduces the force of the air it is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler but the difference is too small to spend any money on so in terms of living up to it is name i give it one star,190,10
594,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,this little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac the name is rather misleading as it was not designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction,40,11
595,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,if you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place if you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust this is what you need it can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust,44,12
596,Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,this is definitely not a noise muffler it is not a silencer either it does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face by redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable i bought this for our new ridgid wd1680 which amazon does not sell the big box store i bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so i got this to go with it used in a garage the vac is surprisingly quiet it seems our hoover upright is much louder i measured the ridgid as-is at 83db with the muffler on it was 83db there was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant i figure it is also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I am going to return it the wd1680 also works as a removeable blower in that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port even although it was the same port with just a tube attachment so bottom line is that this is useless,182,13
597,Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart this really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern and also diffusing it with some very porous foam vacuum performance is not hindered it is not really a muffler as the noise level did not change for me but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying it should really come with the vacuum but since it does not its a no brainer purchase,82,14
598,Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,i bought thisfor the rigid shop vac with detachable blower basically the same unit as the sears craftsman version it makes a noticable difference in reducing the frequency of the sound thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit although i can not say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter i do not have a db meter it certainly makes it seem quieter and much more bearable you do have to watch where you point it although because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction although this is by design it is the blower port after all also it not fully inserted it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on worth the money,130,15
1687,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,warning do not buy these radios i have alot of experience with two way radios i live and work in the mountains of montana and i know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios I have had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers anyway i feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking it is slight but very noticable with regular use i feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can not be certain in addition the sound of the audio is horrible i was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply is not worth it the sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe motorola should recall this product it a serious dissapointment from a company who has name typically means quality these may be the worst radios i have ever owned sorry folks this pair of radios are not worth the box they are shipped in,194,0
1688,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,the product worked but only about 500 yards this may be due to trees and more i suppose in an open foield you might achieve long range conversation,27,1
1689,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,the ordering and shipping on this product was super fast i received it a few days after ordering like the product plan on using it for outdoor activities would recommend this product and it is cheaper than i saw advertised anywhere else,42,2
1690,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios it was frequently very difficult / impossible to understand what the other person was saying confirmed in both directions this was not an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such simply it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded i have an fcc license and have owned numerous motorola radios over the years this set was a real disappointment a radio that can ideally communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can not understand what the other person is saying even from a very short distance away furthermore the housing of these radios lacks durability the rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone just cheap-feeling plastic now,128,3
1691,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,the motorola 9500 was strongly recommended however the set that i received turned out to be a piece of junk very poor voice clarity and quality we depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor to the point of just not using them which put us in a very unsafe position at times i did call motorola and was informed that i was past the warranty time and they would do nothing my recommendation is to buy a set of midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators,108,4
1692,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this is the first pair of two-way radios i have used they work very well voice is clear i tested the range of these units by driving away from the other user we kept talking until the signal began to break up which was about 7 miles your mileage may vary this was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees these units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation,74,5
1693,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,used the motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip great communications with day long battery life and swapping in aa batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions great radios a good buy at a great price,42,6
1694,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,product is extremely easy to use used while on vacation in the islands on a cruise it is an ideal method for communiction when you are with large parties clarity is not bad but not great worked better in open areas,40,7
1695,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,this radio has adequate power and the audio to get out i highly recommend radios will good power like these for the outdoors rather than weak 5 watt frs radios i found them larger than many in this class and a bit under powered at only 2 watts maximum but ok however it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the remanufactured sale list quite often i suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on or it could be something else if lots get returned and resold it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process in any case buy with caution,118,8
1696,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,despacho eficiente y en los tiempos de entrega considerados en cuanto al producto es un buen juguete para los nios tiene sus limitaciones en alcance,25,9
1697,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,pros used with other motorolla and non motorolla radios and the sound quality was good battery holds charge for several days in normal use cons 25 mile range is bizarre because the most that i got was about a mile and a half,43,10
1698,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,it is a great product especially for the price amazon offers it for stores sell the same two way radio for the same price but does not have the 25 mile capability it was a great deal,37,11
1699,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i have not tested these for their full 25 mile range but they seem to work well enough around the office complex and at the park the 2 mile range for urban areas that other reviewers have stated seems to be about right i might have actually gotten more than two miles but i also live in los angeles where we do not have very many tall buildings overall they work well enough for casual use but i would not consider them for more critical applications,83,12
1700,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i have not had much chance to use it as i purchased it for use as an emergency preparedness block captain in my city we have practiced using it but i will not really know until a disaster of some type happens i am pleased to have it for that purpose,51,13
1701,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,despite the problems some other reviewers have reported i have not seen them myself the radios could be more durable but for the money they seem like a good value some friends of mine recently took them beach camping and said they had no trouble with the signal although the users were never more than a few miles away from each other the kids liked the interchangeable covers,67,14
1702,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,the motorola t9500xlr seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment once out of the packaging the 2 units are charged via a cradle i have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well first off keep in mind these are not professional level radios they are merely entry level units for home and family use they are ideal for road caravans amusement parks shopping malls cruise ships and more as other reviewers have mentioned the voice over the speaker is tinny and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible the range is definitely nowhere near the claimed 25 miles in a typical setting you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country just remember these radios cost around 50 for the pair and you simply can not expect professional quality at this price point the noaa radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle overall i wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature,182,15
1703,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,this is my second pair of two-way radios the first set picked up quite a bit of extraneous noise wind staticbut this pair worked much better and was clearer we used them for two days my son and i to try them out at the beach at home and at a big park once we found the right channels they worked perfectly all places i did try to test the distances difficult while walking but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine there was a bit a static at the beach but not too much they are not as clear as your cell phone but if you are out and about at a amusement park or park with your child they will work fine,129,16
1704,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,although the radios had some good features the bad sound quality trumped all of them i had to frequently ask for repeats because the sound was so bad even at close range i do not know whether it is really cheap speakers or bad processing but it sounds like you are talking down a long length of plastic tubing there are other radios for under 10000 that work much much better i just returned the t9500xlrs,75,17
1705,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,these radios have worked well for what i use them for and they keep there charge not more buying batteries they work well,23,18
1706,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,got these so that we can tell our 9yo to come home works with other brands too uniden for sure so he can also communicate with his friends who have other brands while they are playing,35,19
1707,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,for all of the features and capability they put into these radios motorola forgot one key element sound quality other reviews that mention can not understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away are not referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers with only a passing knowledge of audio electronics it would seem that motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker as the sound is very clipped sounding and horribly distorted they could also use a modest compressor on the input as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker for a radio that is marketed as a family product they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk after 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it i still could not get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out these are getting returned unfortunately as they seem to have all the features i want we will try again with midland i think,183,20
1708,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,i love these walkie talkies the sound quality is great and they feel good in your hand i have not had a chance to try them camping but am anxious to do so please note that 25 mile range is optimal when you are in a non populated area with no trees,51,21
1709,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,motorola has done it again these radios work excellent and i would not buy anything else,15,22
1710,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,do not buy the motorola handled radios without this or the ear phone based product if you plan to use the radio in a noisy environment particularly if they are required to wear hearing protection even with the vibrate alarm our employees were often missing talk requests with the clip on speaker and microphone the sound is placed closer to the ears and is heard much easier the radio also need not be removed from the worn position to talk back,80,23
1711,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,the original units would not work right i called morotola and they said those were the deffective ones they sent me new ones that work just fine i sent the old ones back so they could experiment on them motorola provided post paid return envelope a good final experience it pays to go with a name brand that has service department and cares about their customers,64,24
1712,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this is the second pair of radios i buy so that each member of my family has one products works very well and is very useful for our family vacations both at the beach and at the mountains,38,25
1713,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,wow what junk these worked fine for about two weeks then worked intermittently and are now dead now comes the hassle of sending them back to motorola and probably paying more to have them fixed than buying new ones these never should have made it off the drawing board,49,26
1714,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,after owning 2-way frs / gmrs radios by bellsouth cobra and motorola motorola radios were always the highest quality they may not have been the best in every area but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked the last 3 models I have owned have all been motorola i purchased the t9500xlr their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio the other day to replace my t4900s i was appalled at them the sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older cheaper t4900s and worse yet the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually at any range and at any transmit power whether in the next room or half a mile away the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out no settings affected this i ordered a pair of midland gxt710vp3 radios instead they are way better they are what the t9500xlrs should be,147,27
1715,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i purchased these to replace my aging t7200s but there is no comparison the 7200s are far better the 9500xlr have very poor sound quality very tinny like talking in a can the volume does not go high enough and the reception is poor i spent a few days using these two models side-by-side and the weaknesses in these radios jump out immediately i am happy to say that amazon accepted my return do not make the same mistake i did look for a different model,84,28
1716,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,this has been very useful not just for fun but at remote locations of work related business i would suggest easier menu layout the ability to silence ptt confirmation better clip design recommended overall best buy considering what is out there,41,29
1717,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,do not like thisdo well to get 2 mile range can not understand what other person says 1/2 mile away,20,30
1718,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,we bought these for christmas and they were hours of fun the entire week afterwards the boys especially love to use them for air-soft wars because you can wear earphones with them and turn them on vibrate the only complaint we have is that they do not seem to work long-range we had them on vacation took one for a drive in the car and left another at home we lost contact in about 1/2 mile i will say that we did not play around with that feature too much so maybe there is something we could have done to get a longer signal do not know but they are great fun for around the neighborhood,116,31
1719,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,the audio quality is really poor compared to other manufacturers you can not understand other users even over quite short distances and this not helped when the signal keeps dropping in and out whatever you do do not be beguiled by the motorola name and do not expect any support from motorola regarding this problem they will not do anything about these poor quality products i complained to the uk and united states offices of motorola and both fobbed me off i have some really cheap uniden radios which have a superb sound compared to these you can expect better quality from two tin cans and a length of string than motorolas t9500xlr radios,116,32
1720,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,i got these radios because i own two talkabout t5950s i figured that i would upgrade to a newer better model was i wrong they do transmit farther than my prevous model but you can not understand what is being said i am a loyal motorola fan but they had betterup the qaulity i will be returning these radios and i will go back to the old stand-by for another year,72,33
1721,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,this was a real bad decision when people say it all in the name they do not mean motorola t9500r,19,34
1722,Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,great price and loaded with man features hard to imagine not going with motorola,14,35
1723,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,these radios are the worst you can not hear anything it does not matter if you are 5 feet away from the other person or 100 feet they look nice but that about covers it i have nowhy they are still being sold and have not had a recall on the up side i called motorola and they are aware of the problem they are sending me new ones and a different better model they are also sending me return postage so i can send them these awful things back i will let you know how the new ones are,101,36
1724,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,purchased two twin packs of the t9500r radio and the sound quality is so poor they are absolutely useless for transmitting i can hear other radios well enough but any transmit attempts are not understood by other radios do not purchase,40,37
1725,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,i bought these because the mini club i drive with use 2-way radios for communication the came with headsets and either with or without them it was almost impossible to hear what people were saying range was poor too save your money and buy something cheaper these just do not live up to their claims,54,38
1726,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,they work well are a relative bargain and are nice and small the preferred radio for mt biking,18,39
1727,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i use two-way radios at work and on weekends and vacations until now I have been very happy with many different motorola and midland models the t9500 has great features but the sound quality is lousy which makes it virtually unusable,40,40
1728,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,we use 6 8 handheld radios at our business to communicate across multiple floors and buildings we have gone through two generations of motorola talkabouts with this line being the third these are the worst of them all the last generation of blue and black ones was fairly bad with several ceasing to work within days of purchase and so we thought we would upgrade to the next model up of the 6 we purchased 5 did not have adequate sound transmission cutting off at the beginning and end of transmission or not working at all these are junk do not waste your money my one star is because they are attractive to look at,116,41
1729,Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,i purchased these radios a few months ago and essentially have been unable to use them the voice clarity does not exist no one is able to understand anyone it cuts out sporadically i would say that the distance is terrible also but i can not tell if the radio is cutting out or i just can not understand anyone called moto and they actually confirm that there is a problem with this and another new model they recommended that i get the sx800r model at first they would not even take it back oh the noaa channels are great and clear design is also good,103,42
1730,Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,wow have walkie-talkies changed in four years these are packed with some pretty sophisticated features including noaa weather alert and are very user-friendly strongly recommend,25,43
1731,Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,as many people have noted the audio quality of these radios is terrible i also had an issue with the radios cutting out on me and times when i had to turn the radios off and on just to get them to communicate again,44,44
1863,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i would just say on this pot and pan cover that it is heavy weight cover and must be a different one that i saw before i purchased one i thought it was going to be real light but when i received it it was definitely a heavy weight lid for 10 it was a real bargain they must have made it heavier since the one in the article do not buy a 12 inch one this is good for only a 10 inch it is excellent,85,0
1864,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this lid with it is double-ply construction is much better than those available locally in the kitchen departments of discount and hardware stores it has no sharp edges it arrived a little bent but was easily straightened it would have been nice if the description included the fact that it was aluminum this should not be assumed,55,1
1865,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,this thing is tiny too small to cover my 10 inch frying pan guess i should have paid more attention to the dimensions into the trash it goes,28,2
1866,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,i received this and it was all scratched up and look used do not waste your money,16,3
1867,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,sad that a made in united states item is so flimsy was delivered with minor dents and discolored when used to cover a frying pan containing sliced potatoes prior review that mentions not good for covering 12 pans is misleading it barely covers a 10 1/4 8 griswold ci frying pan,50,4
1868,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,have a number of odd-ball or miscellaneous pots and pots you want a lid for it but it either never came with one or you have lost it your savior is at hand i have been using mine for years and is pretty beat-up and abused the fit is kinda awkward for smaller pans the fit is usually rather loose plus it will not fit 12 inch skillets still i love mine and would never give it up you might want to consider another brand that will cover a 12 inch pan,92,5
1869,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i wanted something really light weight to keep in our rv and this one does the job perfectly it is very light weight and it would honestly be easy to bend but it is perfect for what i wanted it for,39,6
1870,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,perfect for cooking bacon hamburgers or anything that splatters it is 10 in diameter and can fit all pots for that size i highly recommend this cover,27,7
1871,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,what can you say these work and are cheap,9,8
1872,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,very good for different size saucepans but be warned as the lid may become very hot,16,9
1873,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,very nice do you have a smaller one for a small fry pan,13,10
1874,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,bought this as a replacement lid for my wax pot sturdy and easy to clean great buy,17,11
1875,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,it is a small cover what i expected,8,12
1876,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,this arrived bent and it was flimsy and pretty much a piece of junk unfortunately i needed it immediately so i could not return it while i did not expect it to be a stellar piece of equipment i did expect it to be a little bit more substantial than the lids on my grandsons toy cook set would never buy it again,64,13
1877,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,way overpriced poor quality something you would find in a dollar store,11,14
1878,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,arrived quickly product was just as described not heavy-duty or for everyday use but works great as a universal pan / pot lid for occasional use it is a bit over-priced,28,15
1879,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i like the lid but the ridges are hard to clean guess i should have expected that,17,16
1880,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,the cover is pretty thick but it came bent the black handle also does not sit perpendicularly to it is base not worth the 14,24,17
1881,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,it is ok matetial is not the best but still use works,11,18
1882,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,this was a very great find the lids fix any and every pot love them thank you,17,19
1883,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,flies just as good as the real frizbee dang near cut the clothes line with it,16,20
1884,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,lighter weight than i expected and the handle was not screwed on tight when it arrived it did arrive in 2 days as promised so kudos to the shipping dept,29,21
1885,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,is actually rather small did not fit the big pans i bought it for but does fit our smaller pots and pans okay nothing special,25,22
1886,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,good everyday cover that fits a variety of pots it did warp a very little either in transit or it was shipped that way,24,23
1887,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,complete crap the lid is very thin and does not insulate the food when it is cooking it was already slightly bent when it arrived but i was able to bend it back straight again most importantly it does not fit all pots well at all the handle on most pots is angled in a way that it does not let the lid lay flush on top so the whole reason for having a lid is lost do yourself a favor and skip this product,85,24
1888,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,pen was not the right size i needed a university cover that was larger it did not cover my large teflon skillet was two inches too small,27,25

1891,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,the lid is not as wide as i had thought so i can not use it on very many skillets this is my fault as i did not measure everything but it is a good product for the money,36,28

1905,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,it works as it should i did end up flipping the knob to the other side so that the lid would not be resting on the handle of my smaller pans it is a bit overpriced seems like something you would find in a thriftshop for 50,45,42

1908,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i like this product but if you have a pan with has a handle that raises above the level of the pan this top will not lay flat and steam will escape,32,45

1915,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this works well for me it is not a perfect fit as other reviewers have noted but with the graduated sizes you move it around a little to find the best fit for your pan i just appreciate it stops any splatter most importantly amazon has fixed the problem of these lids arriving dented with airbags and in a big box my lid arrived in perfect shape,69,52

1923,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,so many skillet sets come without a lid this lid is perfect for the 2 pan set i purchased for my college son in his first apartment,27,60
1924,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i love this pot cover the handle does not get hot so i do not have to find a pot holder to pick it up it is very light which is great with my arthritis it fits beautifully over my medium size omelette / fry pan i can place my favorite ingredients for a vegetable cheese fritatta withwhites in the pan cover it with this 10 cover turn the burner down to very low and wait until it hardens into a perfectveggie pancake then i quarter it 4 wedges and have 4 breakfasts ready to go when i am in a hurry i like that it does not fit so tightly that it can not breathe a little it does lie flat and that is good enough for me i also bought the same pot cover in a16 size to use in my very large fry pan for poaching salmon also very slowly in 1/2 cup chardonnay water to cover 2 - 3 pepper corns lemon juice bayfresh parsley and a slice of onion only takes a few minutes on low once it boils both covers are the ones i use the most in my kitchen,194,61

1930,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,what can you say about a well priced product that solves the problem and dose it is job i like it,20,67
1931,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,very poor quality grooves are two shallow and it foes not stay on my pan and pots securely it is better than no cover at all although,27,68
1932,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,must not be exactly 10 inches did not fit pot too small for a 10 inch round pot flimsy material,21,69
1933,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i like this a lot originally i had no covers love the face that i do not have a dozen lids floating around on the smaller side than expected but still a good buy,33,70
1934,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i would like this same lid in a 12 version it works pretty good for 10 skillets it makes a good spare for my dutch oven that shares a lid with one of my skillets,35,71
1935,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,I have had this lid for years and although i still used it the handle was loose and it was so old i could not tighten the screw when i saw these i ordered myself two use them every day they are light quick fit well in dishwasher and they fit most anything love this reasonable lid,55,72

1937,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,the first time i used and washed it it got discolored also it did not fit the large pan i bought it for it was too small cheap looking also,31,74
1938,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,not worth the price a rip off probably worth a 150 but no more i would not recommend anyone buying this,22,75
1939,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,fits all my pots and pans had one but had given it away glad i was able to get another one,21,76
1940,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,looks great and fits my pan thank you very much i have larger pans that i could use a bigger cover for 12 inch,28,77
1941,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,i wanted a replacement lid for a 10-inch dutch oven and was trying to save money by not buying a glass lid one amazon reviewer said about this fitz-all lid i love mine and would never give it up that was a great endorsement so i bought one it is 10 1/8 inches in diameter the aluminum has a concentric circles design with a very slight concave to the underside the lid sits flush on top of my dutch oven with no lip orto keep it from sliding no problem although and it does a good job keeping in the steam when slow simmering chili or spaghetti sauce make sure to measure the pots you have to see if it will fit the 10 1/8 size my dutch oven is cast iron inner diameter 9 7/8 inches and outer diameter 10 1/8 inches which works fine with this lid i have not tried it on smaller-sized pots / pans yet but that is supposed to be one of it is advantages handling a range of sizes,175,78
1942,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,this is a joke it looks and feels like the toy pots and pans sets we used as children it is not big enough to cover most pans and it is too lightweight and cheap cheap cheap cheap do not waste your money,40,79
1943,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the lid was already bent when i got it just a bit but just taking it to the kitchen using it the first time it was all bent out of shape from being thin soft material so it did not fit the pots tight went to wal mart and came across a really good one that is half glass,59,80
1944,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,these covers are flimsy thin but it would have still serve the purpose i had intended for them if they were smaller i did not realize that they were so big i needed smaller pot covers so these are just not suitable,41,81
1945,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,it looks really ugly and is very small for even small pans i do not recommend it to any one,20,82
1946,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,can cover something will simmering then use same lid for another fry pan or pot less clean up just are very useful product,23,83
1947,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the first time i used the cover it warped now it does not seal thebetween the pan and the cover the steam pours out it was a cheap product at a cheap price,34,84
1948,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i was super angry when my pot lid shattered into pieces most other replacements were super expensive and this one is cheap and affordable and gets the job done it will not be a snug fit on your pot but i did not need it to be so it worked great for me,51,85
1949,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,my own fault that i did not measure my pan but other than that this works a little better than using a plate to cover your pan because you can grab the knob and not burn your fingers mine came with the knob sort of bent and a small dent but I am quite sure that was because of poor packaging shipping was quick although,63,86
1950,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,i was trying to save some money on 8 - 10 in pan lids as a result I have wasted my money on these very poor quality not safe around the kitchen they get so hot in instant if you missed the handle you may get burnt easily go with the real glass ones 3x/4x more expensive although but in a long run it is totally worth it,65,87
1951,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the picture appeared to be a pot and pan top of quality very low level of a top i would not recommend to purchase does not hold head well when cooking does not clean well,35,88
1952,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,i received this full of dents with a screw and no handle the only reason i am not returning it is because it will cost me more to send it back then what it is worth i have been looking for a cover for months then found this and thought it was the end of my search forget it a peice of crap do not order this product,70,89
1953,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,as others have mentioned it is made of aluminum and very big on small pots and pans still it meets the basic need,23,90
1954,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,my boyfriend and i have all sorts and brands of pans from over the years and have misplaced lids this works well on all our pots thanks,27,91
1955,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,this lid is flimsy but better than nothing it also does not sit adequately on the pot if you have handles on your pot,23,92
1956,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,great for those lidless pots it fits any pots up to 10 only drawback is that it does not fit my largest frying pan which is 12,26,93
1957,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,i use this lid every day it replaced one that was years old the size is perfect it fits every pot I have set it on,25,94
1958,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,when i received the package it was already bent up probably because it is not made very well the metal is thin and if you throw it around too much it will definitely bend i suppose it is good for your most basic needs but other than that do not be afraid to dish out a little extra to get a better lid,59,95
1959,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,I am not sure what lid the other reviewers received who said that theirs was flimsy because the one i received is very strong it would be hard to bend or dent this it is small but it is perfect for small pans i like it,44,96
1960,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,it does what i need it to do it is very light weight and would be easy to bend out of shape but it is the answer to a need i have other pots and pan lids are just to big,39,97
1961,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,the description says that this lid fits all but it does not and the material is so cheap i needed it for a casserole that i have bought from goodwill but it did not even come close and it is a 16 casserole,41,98
1962,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,this is a must-have for users of many skillets that lack lids or for those who do not want to clutter up the kitchen with tons of glass lids i agree with the reviewer who said it is flimsy which is why i gave it four stars instead of five mine had a teeny tiny dent in it but really no biggie not as good quality as the old one i have but useful nonetheless as i need one for home and one for the camper,86,99
1963,Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,there has nothing wrong with this lid other than i did not think it through in terms of size before ordering this is not big enough for a large fry pan I shall keep it anyway since it is a decent lid or other pots but if you need it for a large fry pan you need at least 12 1/2 lid and this one is only 10,65,100
2066,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,this is bigger than most trunk jack stands i bought this for my mazda 6 2008 does the job good price soild metal,23,0
2067,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,the crappy little jack that came with my prius fell over when lifting the prius on the flat street in front of my house when it fell it bent i went to replace it and discovered it was 179 or something like that this looks have not used it yet twice as strong,52,1
2068,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,thiswas just as described in the ad and arrived on time it is nice to get a great deal,21,2
2069,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,the jack i ordered was not able to lift my car and was slightly different from the product advertised the company responded with several different options to meet my needs and included detailed information about the replacement options along with pictures i still do not know of the replacement items will do the job they have not arrived yet but the company gets a gold star for working hard to help me,69,3
2070,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,i used four of the jacks as leveling jacks on my small travel trailer i had to modify them to be permanently attached to the frame of my rv they are sturdy and work well for my purpose if you simply want them as a car jack for changing a tire i believe they will suffice the maximum height extension is limited about 18 20 so keep that in mind,71,4
2071,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,it is a car jack after all and a good one it does it is job well and it is easy to use no complains about this product i would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a car jack,41,5
2072,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,i bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well it did fit but it would not lift a 1000 lbalthough rated for 4000 lbs the screw was well lubricated with grease but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank it was cheap but still not worth the little money i paid,63,6
2073,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,cheap fell apart after 2nd use i was lifting my golf cart and it got stuck about half way through the lift i kinda worked with where it was when i was done i went to lower it and noticed it bent with such a littlei bought two of them the bent one went into the recycling bin and other is a garage paper weight,67,7
2074,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,this is a substitute for my 2500 and horse trailer jack works well too,14,8
2075,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,very poorly constructed rated for 2 tons but would not lift 1 tire of my 3000 pound car also it arrived damaged the put the jack in a box too small and simply punched holes in the end of the box for the two ends of the jack so of course both ends of the jack were damaged by the time it arrived,62,9
2076,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,i am not putting this in my wifes car that is what i bought it for but after opening it and extending it out i could see that the metal arms were loosely put together and rickety the screw mechanism is good and smooth but i do not trust this thing to hold up 4000 lbs without creaking one way or the other returning for sure I had rather hassle with sending it back and buying another one than worry every time i crawl under the car i recommend avoiding this jack,90,10
2077,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,the threaded rod or screw was galled up right out of the box was unable to even open it up all the way until i put the jack in a benchto hold it in place why i used a crow bar to work it back and forth 50 times to get it to free up at least they should test this piece of crap before they ship it after working on it for two hours i finally have a jack i can use,85,11
2078,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,jacks situation here in the us is a mess have to use a combination of jacks to change a flat scissors jack is just one that i use,28,12
2079,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,like someone else said it is a car jack what do you expect it was not built to lift the world,19,13
2080,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,the jack i received was somewhat different and had a different crank than the one pictured it was not possible to lift my car using the crank so i am sending it back,33,14
2081,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,my son used it 3 times to change a flat and 2 rear tires on my 97 ford probe and it worked great a little awkward turning but did the job perfectly otherwise the only kind that fit and was sturdy enough,42,15
2082,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,i like theit work really well i have no complains i paid 19 dollars for this so to me it is a good value,26,16
2083,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,5,positive,just received this jack went outside and tested it out worked great lifted my 1998 chevy blazer with no problem the jack was able to lift my truck high enough that i could get a jack stand in and change a tire no problem i will be keeping this on board since i do not have the spare tire jack,59,17
2084,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,1,negative,what a piece of junk do not purchase,8,18
2085,Industrial_and_Scientific,B0025ZC3Q2,4,positive,looks good hope i do not have to use it,10,19

3021,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,corded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days my home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason and more this is one of the few corded phones with caller identification and no answering machine built in the greatest feature of this phone is it has a hold button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless and more also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house,99,1

3026,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this is a good phone that works well the thing to be aware of is the feature buttons like ringer on are all on top if you put the phone on the wall you can not see the buttons and what they are meant for i use the ringer on / off button a lot and i had to write with a marker on the front of the phone where the ringer button is,71,6
3027,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,to me this phone needs to be off the market i have had more problems with each phone i recieved,20,7
3028,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this is my second easytouch ii i like the easy to read caller identification with option to call back once the identification is in the memory large easy to use buttons and speaker feature so i do not have to pick up the receiver if I am working on my pc,49,8
3029,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,phone did not work at all first of all the seller did not send the ac adapter i had to order it then when it came the phone did not work at all the only thing that worked was the caller identification and that is the only reason why i gave it 1 star,54,9
3030,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,5,positive,easy to set up and works fine would buy again recommended to several of my friends especially those with hearing problems,22,10
3031,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,i bought this so i could have a hard line for a storm i also bought it for the speaker phone and it is terrible this is a great phone if you do not mind holding it up to your ear but for the speaker phone it is horrible,48,11
3032,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,the product looks ok the buttons are nice and big and easy to read they do not work very well although for example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often i have to press it several times and just right for it to work it does not come with the ac adapter and northwestern bell no longer makes or distributes them without the adapter the lights do not work including the message waiting light it is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter i have tried several stores such as radio shack best buy walmart and target to find an adapter 120vac to 6v 100ma and can not find one i have not been able to find one online either also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 aa batteries it does not this one takes 4 aaa batteries not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me but the description is not accurate for thei am sending it back,187,12
3033,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this phone is very good for the price i bought this phone for someone else this is the 2nd time I have bought this phone the first time i bought this phone it was 3999 in staples everyone should have a corded phone as a back up if the power fails or power failure in your home the manufacture has this phone listed as white but the phone is a beige that is the only fault I have found with this phone,79,13
3034,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,this phone has no mute button which made it absolutely useless for the application intended i would not recommend if you need this option otherwise the phone was very nice,30,14
3035,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,4,positive,phone works fine i like the one touch memory buttons they would be better if there was more room to put name on each button,25,15
3036,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,somehow i had the impression that the phone had a message waiting led indicator but what they do not tell you is that the same led is used to indicate missed calls which to me makes the led totally worthless the phone i had before used the same light but it flashed green for missed calls and flashed red if there was a message waiting this phone makes no distinction between the two i had plugged the phone into a phone line just to see how it operated i never even got so far as to hang the phone on the wall before judging the message waiting issue because for stuffing the phone back into the box,118,16
3037,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,after shopping around for a standard phone with callerid and no answering machine no power outlet nearby i came across this phone that had good ratings and was reasonably priced i like the look and feel of the phone the buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good however when the unit is wall mounted the lcd display is angled down and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it of course that depends on how high your phone jack is and how tall you are i bought two of these phones and both locations i put them were too low to see without crouching down the other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well i do not know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference i could not try that because the unit did not come with an ac adapter plus i have no power outlet close enough to reach so i had to take both phones down and put our 15 year old ones back up,191,17
3038,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,i actually like the phone quite a bit it works pretty well in almost every regard sound quality is very good buttons are easy to find and use and the feature set is pretty good overall a nice phone and a good value however thisis advertised as having 20 number memory which is 10 one touch and 10 two touch i have not been able to get the two touch feature to work i tried calling the customer support number i could never get an answer i was always put on a queue waited for a couple of minutes and then offered a voicemail option or dropping the call i left messages and never got a call back i twice tried recalling immediately after getting booted i tried for an hour no joy do not buy northwestern bell phones unless you are sure nothing will ever go wrong,149,18
3039,Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,1,negative,this is a real lemon the volume does not work properly and distorts the sound the touchtone keys stick even although i have had this phone less than 6 months i would like my money back,36,19
3040,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i was ripped off by amazons splitting shipping charges after i had ordered the tiesm as a group i was charged 3 shipping charges for 1 mechanical pencil and 2 orders ofrefills total value of product 1035 total shipping 2003 1 pencil 775 s h 505 190 s h 998 2 leads 170 s h 600 outrageous when i tried to cancel the order after it had been split up i was told it was too late never again,81,0
3041,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,the product was excactly as described the seller shipped the product promptly i would buy this product again and i would buy from this vendor again,26,1
3042,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,thedoes erase well if you use fine quality paper it does not erase well on cheap paper i suggest if you are using these to sketch you use moleskine sketchbooks which use a heavier paper than most brands i use thisa lot and i mean a lot when i sketch it is helpful when i am laying down a foundation for character work in my sketchbook now that i own it i can not see myself not using it i can not believe more brands are not mimicking thislead thing i was able to find blue pentellon another site i wish amazon carried it,110,2
3043,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,theis nice but thedoes not write dark enough nor does it erase easily,16,3
3044,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,hard to draw with since it keeps breaking just stick with yourpencils kitties,15,4
3045,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i was expecting this to be exactly like the blackrefills only in red unfortunately it is not the same quality as the blackrefills and breaks very easily i found the constant breaking frustrating and gave up using it i would not buy this product again,48,5
3046,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i disliked this product because it does not erase completely and it is pointless since i wanted to use this in my math class,22,6
3047,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,received the wrongi received 07 mm instead of 05 mm,10,7
3048,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,the kids were so tickled especially our youngest to get this product they really love theof havingthat is ait works well but the novelty effect for children is even better than the product itself,39,8
3049,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,thisis uselessit snaps way too easily and it is impossible to erase do not waste your money,17,9
3050,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i mean i got what i asked for when i bought red pencili got red pencili did not however expect such weak quality it is difficult to use for what i intended it for I am disappointed i can not apply too much pressure or it will snap which means i do not get as strong aas i was hoping for,62,10
3051,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,easy broken colour is light and broke easily,8,11
3052,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,breaks at any pressure applied to the paper,8,12
3053,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,neatbutis so soft i could not write with it at all it kept breaking thewas not very dark either great service although,26,13
3054,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i write a lot with thisit is impossible it breaks all the time do not waste your time or money if you find a solid 05lead please let me know otherwise you jump to 07 and then 2,42,14
3055,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,no smog on paper note make sure you have a good eraser although or be proficient in an adobe ps,20,15
3056,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,use thiswith my pentel graphgear 1000 drafting pencil to mark up plans,14,16
3057,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i tried thisabout 15 years ago and it was terrible i tried it again recently and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be firstly theis very light inyou can barely see it when writing on white paper it is really more of a light pink than a red as well secondly theis very brittle it breaks constantly even when writing with a light touch i can barely write a few lines without a breakage given this fact i do not think thisis useful for anything more than making check marks on papers i certainly can not do any serious writing with it lastly it feels very strange to write with it granted it is not a graphitethe feel is still unusual like trying to write with something made of wax if thiswere not so brittle and light init might be worthwhile but alas i simply can not use it,170,17
3058,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,just got it today so i decided to try it out first off i bought this to sketch with i see many reviews on this product saying it breaks too easily from what i can tell it does not break that easily as far as the lines on paper i can sort of compare it to colored pencil like but not necessarily overall i like this product and i am very glad i bought it,74,18
3059,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,very cheap breaks easily dony bother putting it in through the tip because it shall peel and erases terribly do not waste your money,22,19
3060,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,it is really nice being able to use a fine point mechanical pencil to mark up blueprints all although they do not erase well at all,25,20
3061,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,breaks constantly so much so that is it not useable,9,21
3062,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,i use them for design drawing markups red-pencils are bolder so i keep those handy these allow me to make finer detailed notations it is true that theis softer than black leads but as long as you are gentle enough they work just fine i put a red-band of fingernail polish on my pencil so that i know which one has the red leads in it,66,22
3063,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,breaks at the slightest pressure poor quality,8,23
3064,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,not brightnot good for writing at all eraser can not remove this pencil so it is pretty much the same as ball-point pen not what i expected,27,24
3065,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,thebreaks very easily however I am able to get a good range of values for sketching and it is really fun to use coloreddefinitely pick it up for the price of it,34,25
3066,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,we use these in our inspection pencils and they are just what you expect,14,26
3067,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,there is no such thing as redour pencilis actually graphite which can not be red sadly as it is a form of carbon cc this is actually very thin wax the same kind found inpencils i love this it pairs off with the 5 steadler pencil i received as a gift nicely it is not too brittle to the point that it breaks on contact you must be soft with it and use many layers one thing i learned is that you should only use about 1 mm or 2 mm ofat a time coming out of the pencil I have attached some photos of my doodles i do at work while combing thiswith graphite and sumi ink respectively,126,27
3068,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,they break fairly easily but that is no indication of poor quality it is just the nature of coloredgo with 07 mm for colored leads it is much more durable,29,28
3069,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,too fragile press hard enough to see the writing and they break,12,29
3070,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,use these a lot for sketching very smooth and easy to use,12,30
3071,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,thebreaks easily when using a steel mechanical pencil only use in a plastic one if you do not want it to break every stroke,25,31
3072,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,good product but breaks easily going back to regular red pencils,11,32
3073,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,these break if you even look at them,8,33
3074,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,it is cool that it is mechanical and red it makes ticking work easy thebreaks so often although it is barely worth even trying,26,34
3075,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,this is basically just led removed from a colored pencil and coined for writing works very poorly less effective than simply writing with a colored pencil to begin with,29,35
3076,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,i work as an intern for a construction company and to make corrections to drawings we use red pencil and this works perfectly in my pentel 1000 graphgear pencil however if too much force is used while writing thetends to break quite often other than that this stuff works great,52,36
3077,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,theis very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks it is not a dark red and can be hard to see if not using on white paper it does not erase easily but you can erase it if you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light inand fragile than this is your pick i can not really say i have tried others,71,37
3078,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,i homeschool and was going through red pens like mad decided a pencil would be cheaper and work better so ordered these they work fine but the next time I shall probably try to get them for my 09 pencil the 05requires that you write lightly and to get red pencils to really show on students papers you have to press a little harder than normal,67,38
3079,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,this product is exactly what i ordered and it arrived quickly thebreaks easily but is expected out of red 05 mm,23,39
3080,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,thisis very soft and will break on a regular basis theis very light if you try to reduce the amount of pressure you use,28,40
3081,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,like most i wanted to have a second mech pencil with redfor markup i do not know how hard some reviewers stroke is but these work fine for me with no breakage yet even pressing hard however they are more waxy than blackso when pressing hard they do wear quickly and they do erase but not nearly as readily as normal blackas tothese are red not pantone whatever maybe they are a shade of pink but they are red as distinguishable from black which is all i think they are meant to be,101,41
3082,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i am a teacher and was hoping to use these for grading since i prefer writing with a pencil these did not work out at all for me thebreaks every few minutes annoying i will try a thicker gauge,41,42
3083,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,i can certainly would like use good colored auto pencils to underline my bible and supplement my drawing pads but i found this redto be a little light when drawing and i had to press harder so i like the concept but please make something with more ease of drawing and deeper,55,43
3084,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,thewas not red but a light pink thewas hard and scratchy i could neot even see the lines unless i used heavy pressure,27,44
3085,Office_Products,B000087L7C,4,positive,took kind of a while to arrive it is a fine pentel product some people has complained it breaks easily and it does break easier than regularbut I am sure it is difficult to make coloredas hard as regular i press really hard when i write so i just had to be mindful and it was fine,58,45
3086,Office_Products,B000087L7C,5,positive,if you have to red line or correct tests homework or mechanical drawings this is what you want to use it produces a fine accurate line for any 05 mm mechanical pencil once your peers see your handiwork they will all be asking you for a piece of red led for their correcting pencil it can not be erased like a pen so it is pretty much tamper proof red marking,68,46
3087,Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,i bought the redfor correcting papers but it has proven useless theis very soft and crumbles easily while writing the crumbling is especially a pain when revising papers because i think i tend to press harder while correcting small detailed text features also theis too light and compared to regularthere is no advantage it also does not erase so clearly i wish i had not bought this especially so much of it,79,47
3088,Office_Products,B000087L7C,2,negative,thisis very soft if you push out more than a millimeter it breaks i find i can not use thiswithout feeling the metal of the pencil scraping the paper if you advance it any further thebreaks very disappointing product,44,48
3404,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,as the brits say it does what it says on the tin the switches are nice and a cool blue led is included for nights in the forward berth of our boat the solar panel worked flawlessly and installation on our boat was simple i do not have any way of knowing how many cfm of air this thing actually moves but you can at least feel air movement when you have it on blow in mode recommended for an inexpensive ventilation device if you have sun available,88,0
3405,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,this small vent is intended for installation in a small utility trailer although i can not yet report on how it works when installed i found the battery operation of the light fan and directionality of airflow works well no sunlight indoors so do not yet know how the solar works the fan makes minimal noise when the unit is held as it will be when mounted however that disappears to no sound when tilted as little as 5/10 degrees,80,1
3406,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i put two of these on my 45 foot sailboat one set to suck and the other set to blow it was like a vortex of very mildly detectable solar powered tornado wormholes was created running through my boat from front to back it almost caused me to lose control of my helium indoors only r / c zombie shark but luckily i am an excellent air shark pilot and pulled through i am afraid to set them both to suck as it may because my ears to pop or i could pass out as it sucks all the oxygen out of the cabin but i think i can get out sometime in the 3 weeks it would take to do that i do have a scuba tank that should drop from the over head in an emergency air loss just in case i think the head trauma from the last time it deployed changed things in my brain so i kinda keep it taped up there,165,2
3407,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,this vent does not move much air you can barely tell it moves any air not worth the price do not waste your money ricko,21,3
3408,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,got what i ordered it looks good easy to install works fine how long it will last is an open question,21,4
3409,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,nicerealy works maybe a bit weak for an exhaust van but has worked continually for over a month,19,5
3410,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,product seems good although instructions were a bit ambiguous and not yet certain that it does all we hoped,19,6
3411,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,purchased 2 of these fans for a boat in june they look fine and nightlight is a nice feature they are crap do not buy them unless you just want a nice nightlight the fans will not start and operate unless you smack them even in bright sunlight so you become the switch they have a one year warranty so we will see how that goes,64,7
3412,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,it was great while it worked worked for 1 year and now it will only run on battery solar part does not work,22,8
3413,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,does not do much very little air is moved,8,9
3414,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,unfortunately this product did not hold up as advertised we are looking for something to replace it to fit in the hole that has been cut into our outbuilding any more damage would be bad,36,10
3415,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,do not expect a crazy difference but it does the job it works the light looks cool in our camper van and actually helps our vision at night again it is a small vent do not expect big vent differences in temperature I am happy with this product sawed a hole in roof of fiberglass went right in with some caulk vent is a tid bit noisy again to be expected it really does change the temperature i can feel it if i move my hand under it and the other on the other side that is not insulated and without a vent about 10 - 20 degrees difference consider the price of purchasing the saw hole component when you purchase this i think mine was about 40 at home depot,125,11
3416,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works great for my outdoor she would just the right size and easy to install,14,12
3417,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,thisstopped working after about 3 days,8,13
3418,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,I am not sure if the fan is supposed to spin both ways but mine will only suck air in it will not blow air out which is really what i wanted,31,14
3419,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,lasted 1 year all rusted the circuit board is poorly made and fragile would not recommend this vent,18,15
3420,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,update will not work anymore it has been few months now and every time i go to the boat it is not running few hits and it starts but stops again so need to remove it and thrown away,37,16
3421,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,installed this solar vent in the front hatch of my sail boat about 4 weeks ago it is working as advertised no issues with leaks in normal weather conditions have not tested it in green water conditions although,37,17
3422,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,better battery would make this a 5 star,9,18
3423,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it is ok for a tiny room tiny tiny room,9,19
3424,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it was noisy and only lasted six months not worth the postage spent on it,15,20
3425,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,not worth the money as it moved literally no air that i could sense,14,21
3426,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so i returned it for my money back otherwise it worked and looked nice if it were not for a bedroom application i would probably have kept it,41,22
3427,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,so far so good works as advertised after 3 months the light is a nice added feature,17,23
3428,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,well built and fairly nice to look at airflow is lower than hoped but adequate,15,24
3429,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,terrible lasted one month what a rip off,8,25
3430,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,do not buy this airflow is minimal and hardly worth the trouble it just does not have enough power,17,26
3431,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,good vent i wish it had a way of closing when i turn the vent off installation directions are very general so take your time and think it through if you not at handy person,35,27
3432,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,installed it and met my expectations it does not move a great air volume but is the same with any other solar vent pros you can invert air direccion in / out works at night by means of a rechargable bat and has a cortesy light cons does not move large air volume,49,28
3433,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,i put the su force in my small greenhouse nice features not as much airflow as i expected then it quit working after a couple of weeks i have not had time to try customer service so hopefully they will make it right,42,29
3434,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,i bought three of these to put in my rv they stay on all night running on the internal battery they are very quiet but they do not pull / push too much air,30,30
3435,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,works great is good quality and i like the features however the fan power is a bit weak if you have a small greenhouse it works fine but not for any house over 6 x 8,36,31
3436,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,high quality although full engineering i use it on my salt water coastal cruiser there is never too much ventilization in aboat,22,32
3437,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,using it in she had that is being built will not know till i experience it,15,33
3438,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,works once in a while when it feels like it too many switches confusing design blue light is inadequate and when the fan decides to come on it hardly moves any air at all,34,34
3439,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,i did not like them they are not stainless steel plus the inside is made of very chip plastic i guess i got what i paid for,26,35
3440,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,this works awesome in my vehicle never leaked once properly installed even driving 65 mph on the freeway in a driving rain,21,36
3441,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,used in an 8x12 storage she had to keep humidity under control it is not going to win any prizes for air movement but it vents enough to do the job during the summer looks better than most options,37,37
3442,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,i would like to have it in place a while before i pass judgement the last one different mfg let me down after about a year,26,38
3443,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i live aboard a 40 feet sailboat and these vents supply me with outside air when conditions dictate all of my hatches need to be closed the addition of the lightng feature is the future will prove a plus it is surprising how much light is put out,48,39
3444,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,looks good and runs fine so far no more condensing on the boat interior instructions are poor on setting switches for anyone installing them the reason they say 4 1/2 inch hole is that 4 1/4 is to small it is not a tight fit in the 4 1/2 hole leaves room for doing an epoxy coating onor hatch coring,62,40
3445,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,it does not work plain and simple instructions are pretty much useless and there is no way to mount this without taking the cover off and drilling your own holes,30,41
3446,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works great for venting rvs that sit out in the hot sun,12,42
3447,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,noisy but circulates as long as the sun is shining on it,12,43
3448,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i installed this myself and it works great,8,44
3449,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,very low flow but does the job i used it to vent an outhouse stink pipe and it works good battery does not make it through the night but it is mostly needed for hot days,34,45
3450,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,cheaply made does not seem to have much airflow do not know what it was meant to ventilate certainly nothing larger than a shorbox,22,46
3451,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,works well clean and easy to use and install started up right away we are using it to vent a greenhouse,21,47
3452,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,I am still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so i can not vouch for their efficiency but i wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is not 45 or 5 as stated in various comments here the instructions that come with the fan say cut a 45 diameter hole using the template provided the template measures 425 not 45 i cut a test 425 hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat so do not order that 45 hole saw and mandrel for 50 i used a 7 adjustable circle cutter that i got at harbor freight it worked fine i am replacing the plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so i have the luxury of doing this work in my shop the only other comment that i have about the fan is that the ss cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates i have quite a condensation problem in my boat so i am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust I shall keep you posted,201,48
3453,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,this solar vent was very easy to install and can potentially replace one meant for a 35 hole on my boat this replaced a 45 vent leaving a little bit of abut there is a beauty ring included that hides any size difference quite well the light is not enough to read by but will help you see the other switches in the dark the fan direction can be changed and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night it looks great easy to install I am very happy with it so far it was 3 times cheaper than those available at west marine so time will tell how well this truly holds up in a marine environment,130,49
3454,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,these are great low profile and work just fine my issue is this the exterior screws are rusting after only a week outside i doubt they will last very long the worse part the rusty water is leaving rusty streaks on my sailboatsruining my gelcoat and causing expensive damage to the paint i dunno what to do update today about one year later they broke seems they are not as waterproof as i had thought,77,50
3455,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i used in in mobile storage transport trailers does good job of keeping humidity in control hawaii 80 no mildew since installed,23,51
3456,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,to slow battery did not charge well instruction not clear it can be good for someone but not for me,20,52
3457,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,bought this sunforce stainless steel solar vent for my new vinyl storage she had to be cooler inside i think it would be a better unit if the electric fan in it ran faster i felt outside just under it and it does move some air just not enough i guess well built and durable housing also,56,53
3458,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,right out of the box it was slow to operate and you could see that the fan was not running true it wobbled and made a slight rubbing sound within a month it quit working due to a broken wire from the motor looking for a less expensive to the nicro i guess you get what you pay for,59,54
3459,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,the sunforce 81300 stainless steel solar vent appears to work as advertised helps to lower temp in rv in hot weather and circulate air when rv is not occupied without having to plug rv to power sold by amazon with free shipping at b000bynglu,46,55
3460,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,we are using this in a small hothouse and it works just great it was easy to install and seems to have reduced mid day temperatures significantly been working for about 3 months with no apparent problems,37,56
3461,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,this solar vent stopped working within six months of installing it and being after june 2012 amazon will only give me a partial credit and i pay for shipping and sunforce can not even return my phone calls or emails do not waste your money and now i have a hole in my she had,53,57
3462,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,short and sweet works great in my small greenhouse looks expensive i would buy this again if i ever need one,21,58
3463,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,i thought it was a bit pricy but the thing does work the light works as well this is not a tornado fan but is a small solar fan which we will use to move air through our cargo trailer,40,59
