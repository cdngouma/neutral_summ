0,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are very thin pull off easily without residue rare the only odd thing about these is that on the crease it actually had cut out slits along it so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket / shirts,45,0
1,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,sweat went right thought within almost 2 hrs of wearing it not the best,14,1
2,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,so far they have not really worked will not stick to the fabric of my jacket,15,2
3,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,i have tried several brands of shields and most do not stay attached all day / evening this purchase resulted in a great product that stayed put for as long as needed love them and am hoping that i receive an equally excellent product when i need to reorder,46,3
4,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,they do not stick well to the fabric bunch up not comfortable,12,4
5,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,it did not stick to the material of my shirts,10,5
6,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,my wife thinks that these things are great,8,6
7,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,thedoes not adhere to clothing very well it is basically pointless to use this product very disappointing indeed,19,7
8,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,these shields were too flimsy did not sick and bunched up will not purchase again,15,8
9,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,the shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket i had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well just be mindful when you take the jacket off / put it on i will continue to use these much improved from older versions that would come off,56,9
10,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,perfect for the victorian era ball now i do not have to wash the whole dress after every event,18,10
11,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,very hard to position not worth the hassle,8,11
12,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,theseems great but once i started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat it is kind of a give and take on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side it is not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck,70,12
13,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,great product i used these for a series of interviews that i would not have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview they worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used,35,13
14,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,i bought 3 brands of dress-shield and i tried these last these were thinner like the 2nd brand and i understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin they are useless people who buy these sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time money and embarrassment if you perspire avoid these if you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes good enough,75,14
15,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,helped prevent stains but did tend to slip a little,10,15
16,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,i can see how these may not be the best for a shirt however they have saved me on dry-cleaning for my work blazers a nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it is awesome to get a few wears out of each during either a big client meeting or a hot spring / summer day these will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure,63,16
17,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,these are good in theory but they do not stick to my clothing,12,17
18,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,barely sticks to clothing ends up bunched and then unattached,10,18
19,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,the adhesive does not seem strong enough several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when i applied them to silkier fabrics on the plus side these pads are quite thin and quiet,41,19
20,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,it is not sticky and the material is poor,8,20
21,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,they did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay,23,21
22,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,I have only used this once it worked fine,8,22
23,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product very bad quality for the price i paid,14,23
24,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,greatbut held up poorly kept peeling off and sticking to my skin no bueno,16,24
25,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,great concept in theory but i find they do not fit well in blazers as I had intended to use them,18,25
26,All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,these are perfect to protect your clothing from sweat and staining and odor i use these in blazers mostly they are perfect i will say that if you are sleeves are tight this shield will be difficult to apply / stay in place when you put the blazer on they are the perfect size for the underarm and you can not tell they are there these are must-haves for long work days,66,26
42,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,i like it but it is to low when i try to watch movies it is dim so what I am saying here is it is height is bad but otherwise it is preety good,31,0

46,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,elastic clips were inconsistent on both pieces we purchased the inconsistencies allowed the tablet to not only slide back and forth but would slide right out the side and ultimately would hit the floor as although it had no case at all,42,4
47,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,does not work it is just another universal case just as someone else said you have to remove it from case to use camera,23,5

73,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,for the price it offers more protection than the soft cases but the tablet fell from the arm of a recliner and the screen still cracked because the case does not lock if you have children or pets i suggest a case with a locking latch,45,31

100,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,advertises the case is for the trio stealth g2 however in order to take a picture you must remove your tablet from this case before you can take a picture most cases you can leave your tablet right in the case while taking pictures also this case does not stand when reading as shown in picture it falls over just for those two reasons alone this case is worthless,68,58
101,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,advertised for trio tablet however there is no hole for the rear facing camera so you can not use the camera if the tablet is in the case,27,59

103,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,i really like this tablet case it fits the trio stealth-10 perfectly the claws hold the tablet very snugly to the case there is no room for play that would allow it to fall out theis very vibrant and i love the black elastic band that holds the case tightly closed and the bonus stylus fits perfectly in the ear plug outlet so it will always be available,70,61
104,All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,the cover is nice but the fact that it was suppose to come with a free bonus stylus and it did not was a let down,25,62

109,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,i liked it a lot it looks really nice on a hand and it does not look cheap the only thing that was bad few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly so i had to fix it with pliers so that it would not fall apart,50,0
110,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,it is okay and i like it however it is cheaply made,11,1
111,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,the bracelet is very pretty but not well designed it does not stay in place,14,2

113,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,i purchased this bracelet and ring combo for a teenaged granddaughter because it is so unique also it is a cute and inexpensive gift to give for no special reason or to add to her christmas gifts i hope she will love it,41,4
114,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,very I shall fitting ring too small bracelet too big,9,5
115,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,this is very flimsy i bought it for my daughter to wear to her senior prom but the ring broke off before she even got the chain part hooked,29,6
116,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways i steel like it but is crapy,17,7
117,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,product as expected but although stated it would be slow was even longer than expected as other items ordered from over seas on the same day can a week sooner,30,8
118,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,the ring part broke off from the chain the first time i put it on,15,9
119,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,broke i kept the ring part because it was cute laughing out loud,11,10
120,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,got thistoday and it was already broken,9,11
121,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time i wore it,19,12
122,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,i bought thisas a joke for my grandmother knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only 200 when she received it the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring or the bracelet part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo instead of soldered together even if you want to make someone laugh or buy for throw away jewelry do not,68,13
123,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,a sleek exotic piece they were beautiful on my model and my date was complimented all night i will check and buy from this company again,26,14
124,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,thiswas well worth what i paid for it it was good quality for the price and i received it very quickly,23,15
125,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,this is a really cute accessory the ring is an incomplete circle so you can adjust it just right the chain to the wrist is a good length the one real drawback is it is actually pretty hard to connect he clasp on the bracelet part without help because of the weight but i salved that by replacing the clasp with a magnate,62,16
126,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,kinda big i have small wrists very cute although,9,17
127,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,this thing fell apart like 10 min after i gave it to my girlfriend i would not recommend this to anyone do not buy this cheap thing we did not expect a high quality piece of jewelry as it was for halloween but it did not even make it to the party,50,18
128,All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,no sizes on it biger than my fingers,9,19
129,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,hate these pens the pens are not multicolored and the ink runs out after a few uses would not buy again,21,0
130,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i am a nurse so i thought these pens would be great and easy to access attached to my badge holder this first one exploded the first day i used it all over my scrubs and i looked like a slob all day i thought it was just a freak accident so i decided to give another one a try the same thing happened there is definitely a flaw in the design and i will not be using them again,80,1
131,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i use these quite frequently to take notes since i do not have a smartphone the only complaint i have is that sometimes if you push the pen into it is cap too hard it will break this is only a problem since the cap is what attaches to the keychain aside from that although they work fine great for carrying around in a pocket,63,2
132,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i have no need to write with pink purple or green ink blue is ok but black is the best,20,3
133,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i need a pen attached to my keychain at work at all times i have always used the mini rsvp pens from pentel most stores in my area are not carrying them so i found these sorry but i hate them they are very small for writing and since i attach them to my keychain the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day my other pens never broke thicker plastic if you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok i will not buy these again since i have found the pentel pens i want on amazon oh and the chain they come on is a joke totally worthless,120,4
134,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,I shall have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion as described and intended however i was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket and it works very well for that i unscrew the little keychain attachment and the lid stays on in my pocket so I am always ready to write in a notebook i carry i frequently have a better pen but not always this one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen otherwise it is a little too stubby the product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter but it works well for what i wanted,130,5
135,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,honestly if i had known the cap would fall or pull off so easily i never would have purchased this product i should have looked for push button or twist pens instead these pens are small fit well on a keychain and writes okay but i almost lost the cap s quite a few times due to the price point it is not worth the time returning but i will not buy again,70,6
136,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are the perfect size to put in my diabetic meter bag thank you so much,17,7
137,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,good deal for the number of pens definitely wrap a strip of tape around the head of the pen to keep the pen from falling out of the cap if you keep them on your keys / if they will be yanked around a lot,43,8
138,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these come in handy when you do not have a pen ready just put it on your key chain and you will always have a pen handy amazinglove it I have given away 6 already close friends and others i tell them where to buy them keep up the good work with fantastic ideas,53,9
139,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,love these little pens they work great with post-it note holders,11,10
140,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the caps came broken this is the second time i ordered these just because i like the size and i can not find any other brand,25,11
141,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,pen constantly slips out of cap preventing me from keeping pens on the key ring more of a pocket pen than anything,22,12
142,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,worthless product and i assume because it is cheap i lost 2 pens already in 2 days so obviously i bought the pen caps not the pens because it is the only thing it stay very lose and weak,37,13

146,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pen does not stay in the cap using it as a keychain is useless because it falls out too easily,20,17
147,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,exactly what i wanted hard to find in office supply stores,11,18
148,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,got these for my husband who makes deliveries and needed a pen to attach to his lanyard they are good but as they are used over time one fell out of the cap and got lost however considering how inexpensive they were I had still buy them again,47,19
149,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,not happy after giving these out in stockings a few of them did not light up,16,20

151,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i still have nowhy 6 colored pen with all black ink,13,22
152,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wore them attached to my lanyard after less than a week the pen did not stay in the cap the fit is not tight enough,24,23
153,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,the pen writes well the cap does come off easily so it is not suitable on a lanyard or keychain it is perfect to put inside a purse or pocket,30,24
154,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,I am always in need of pens when going out to events dinner movies when i have a small purse with me these are small and perfect they are 3 inches long black ink i will buy more well worth the money,40,25
155,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,i love these these are great little pens and i have already re-ordered more they write very well and i love the different colors i am using them inside small survival kits,32,26
156,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,great little pen just what i was looking for,9,27

158,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,this work great with my passport love them,8,29
159,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i needed very small pens for wallet and small handbags these are almost perfect the cap separates from pen barrel too easily a dried thin strip of water-proof fabric glue inside opposite sides of cap takes care of grip for cap now to keep my daughter from adopting them,49,30
160,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,too small and pour plastic broke in one week,9,31
161,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,loved the pen at first worked great and convenient to keep on my badge for work always had a pen to sign documents with however the caps continually fell off not worth the buy,34,32
162,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are great as they fit in your pocket i use them on a lanyard for taking notes in the field and they do not hang as low as a regular pen would amazon seems the only place you can actually find this pen size,45,33
163,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,exactly as ordered perfect for lots of places where a pen is too large,14,34
164,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted to hang it from my lanyard but the hardware did not hold up and i lost the pen,20,35
165,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,time will tell whether the caps fall off but so far so good the pens write well no skipping they do not feel cheap in the hand the little o-ring on top of each cap is small but i did not have a problem fitting it onto a small flashlights o-ring after i removed the chain the chain itself is not sturdy to the eye or feel essentially useless i would not trust it to hold otherwise I am pleased,76,36
166,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pens themselves usually worked fine for me but the caps do not attach strongly enough to the pens for them to be a good keychain pen i lost all of these within about a month because the caps where the keychain is attached just did not stay attached to the pens,52,37
167,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i use them allways one in each bag,8,38
168,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,no ink clogs easy to put cap on and off great for nurses who never can keep up with pens,20,39
169,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,do some geocaching they are not the best quality but they are great to leave in a larger geocach container for other cachers to document their find,27,40
170,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i work in a hospital and purchased these to wear on my badge i was hoping for a pen that would be easily accessible and would not get lost or misplaced greatbut not so great product for it is intended use i could not make any of these pens last more than a week before the pens started falling out of their cap with normal use some of the caps cracked and some of them just stopped clicking onto the pen it is pretty frustrating when you try to grab your pen in the middle of examining a patient and there has nothing dangling there but a pen cap,106,41
171,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,i do not know why i did not look at the reviews first i wanted to have pens on our keychains so we always have one the cap fits the pen so loosely i really do not think it is going to stand the test of time if you are going to make a keychain pen maybe you should make it so it will work on an actual keychain,64,42
172,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,the pen does not like to stay in the cap,9,43
173,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,they all fell apart rather quickly and got separated,9,44
174,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i wanted these pens to keep on my work badge / key ring so i would always have a pen handy but the pen constantly falls out of the cap so i lost 3 pens within a few weeks before i gave up they would be better if the cap stayed on and if they had colored ink to match theof the case,63,45
175,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,thewritersedge dot com space pen store reviewed this product and found it to be of excellent quality yet recommends that you go to our website and take a look at the authentic fisher space pens that write upside down through water dirt oil and in freezing temperatures,48,46
176,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,the pens are not tightly held to the caps so they are lost within hours seriously all 6 were gone within hours of attaching to my key chain,28,47
177,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,plastic cracked and broke in less than 24 hours,9,48
178,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,cheap and a greatbetter in some ways than the nite eyez ones because you do not have to unclip anything to get your pen just pull free of the cap and write my wife clips one to her scrubs pantleg loop plus they are dirt cheap lose one goes through the laundry no tears,54,49
179,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i used these for work peds nurse for labeling so i always had a pen handy attached right to my identification i even attached one to my wallet but the pen itself eventually fell off clickable minis may be a better option if you expect a lot of movement / use of whatever you have it attached to convenient otherwise,57,50
180,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,cap will come loose after a few weeks in your pockets thus i end up with a cap on my key ring without a pen on it if these were threaded caps it would be perfect,36,51
181,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i am definitely impressed with the pens i quickly put one on my work keys and on my car keys never have to borrow a pen again within a week both pens had fallen off without me realizing it caps need to be tighter,44,52
182,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,just what the doctor ordered when you need a pen and do not have one some more words to get past the minimum what a silly,26,53
183,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i like that these pens all have black ink the orange green and more ink pens that you find in some of these sets have limited value if you are not a teenage girl these pens are half the length of typical pens but you can flip the cap over to lengthen them for comfortable writing the small size makes these great for carrying in a pocket when you are on the go and the cap style prevents leaking construction is cheap and lightweight but they are a decent value at less than a dollar per pen the keychains seem pretty flimsy and i discarded them did not really want that feature anyway,110,54
184,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,pens go in her pocket so when a patient calls she has got the pen right with her to write with great product she loses them a lot i will be a frequent flyer on this one,36,55
185,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,i am a pe teacher and need pens to be handy for quick writing i was totally disappointed of this product the eons will not clip back into the cap after a couple uses it got to be who can find that bright orange pen in the grass first activity save your money not a good product to attach to a key ring,62,56
186,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,maybe I am just hard on things in my pocket but these things break very easily on every one of them the screw that connects the pen to the key ring pulls out of the cap stripping the hole I have tried using super glue to put it back together which works for a little while also the pen does not stay in the cap very securely much prefer the nitepocket pen by inka,74,57
187,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these are great for my purposes i always need a pen that is easy to carry around and I am the type that like to carry as little as possible so these are great because they fit in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans i never noticed them until i need to write something down I am not sure why the description listed the product box with product dimensions 65 x 28 x 04 inches but the pens are 35 inches long and they are all black ink i was worried since the description mentionedred / blue / black / green / purple but these are describing theof the casing not the ink i needed simple blue or black but cringed at the description of the colors i can not believe that I am excited about pens,131,58
188,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are great for keeping on your lanyard and are always handy perfect for teachers and the colors are great too,22,59
189,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,especially for pre-teens kids b4 their growth spurt all grandkids enjoy these in their xmas socks along with a small empty book they can fill with their ideas,28,60
190,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,these pens are perfect for attaching to a lanyard so you always have a pen with you the chains are reasonably strong I have only had one fall off and that was when it got scrunched in a corner the pens are moderately tight in the cap they do not fall out with normal use but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be friction locked allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap the pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks such as writing a signature or jotting down a note there is no way you would want to use it all day unless you have small hands,128,61
191,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are not meant for writing papers or business i gave away as little tokens and i can tell you that right now my co workers still have these little cute pens hanging from their desks they are fun and great since they can be pinned on a refrigerator magnet they do not write bad either,56,62
192,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,i should have bought the retractable kind of mini pen without caps that can be lost,16,63
193,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,although the pens write nicely attaching the keychain to the cap of the pen was a horriblei keep losing the pens throughout the day because they are not designed to stay in the cap under stress,38,64
194,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,these pens are a greatbut because there is no twist to secure the pen in place it is subject to dislodge and be lost other than that it is a very handy tool,36,65
195,All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,like the true utility pen the problem is that taking your keys in and out of your pockets the pen will pop off i fixed this problem with these buy wrapping a piece of tape electrical ortape around the part where the cap seats on the pen now i need to really pull hard so i hopefully will not lose them,62,66
196,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love these i got them to make my parents crazy and it worked,14,0
197,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,looks real and stays on my lip great almost gave my parents a heart attack when i wore it to go eat supper with them it does stick a little if you use it on your lip because of the moisture from your mouth also would not suggest eating with one on your lip food gets stuck on the sliding thing quite easily,62,1
198,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are a little thicker than i expected but they work wonderfully,12,2
199,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,they definitely serve their purpose and look realistic although they are not made for daily 24 hour use they are excellent for pictures and testing to see if you would want a piercing the colors you receive vary so do not expect an exacti got more pink than i wanted but i was okay with that i definitely recommend them,61,3
200,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,pretty came 5 days late but nice two purple three silver,10,4
201,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,just do not buy it it does not look real it looks so fake and you do not even get different colors they are all silver and break at the slightest touch,29,5
202,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,i thought i was getting differenthoops yet i got all silver and broken hoops horrible product very disappointed,20,6

204,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these were great and look so real but super easy to lose if you are not a very organized person,19,8
205,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,the hoops are huge and they did not come in multicolor all hoops were purple way to big to wear anywhere but upper ear lobe,25,9
206,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,if you wear it for to long it irritates the skin where it is and it might leave you with a scar but would buy again,26,10
207,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,work exactly like they say they do work well as a faux septum / cartilage piercing although it was a little too big for my nose to wear it as a nose ring,31,11
208,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,this was an amazing buy it came in fast and nothing was broken or missing i received three gold one red and one purple i wore it around town and i had to go to walmart and my friend saw me and asked if it was real i did not want to lie so i said no it is a fake and she said it looks good on you i was quite surprised someone actually thought it was real i love it I am going to buy more and hope for more colors,90,12

211,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,too big i think for it to pass as a real nose ring,13,15
212,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i really like them and use them a lot i got 2 gold 1 red 1 purple and 1 pink i was hoping for on to be black but it was fine would recommend does not leave a mark but can tend to hurt for a while if you leave on for a pretty long time,55,16
213,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love it it comes with 4 and came really early,11,17
214,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,these left awful soars on my daughters noise way too tight,11,18
215,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,arrived a week early which i thought was kinda nice until i saw the quality of the product itself it came with only four even although the product clearly says five and they were all blue no variety ofthere and they are all broken either the silver clip part fell out or is jammed open honestly the worst purchase I have ever made i do not even want new ones or anything to do with these guys ever i would only recommend these to people who want to waste money,89,19
216,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,this is a great product shipped 2 weeks early and looks real i got them to feel like i have piercings and to trick my friends because I am not allowed to have piercings yet anyways this is a great product that looks real the only problem i have with the product is getting them on they are so small that it is really hard to get it on your lip in the right place they are so small you have to practically rip you lip off but when on they are secure and feel great also if you are like me and are sensitive to certain materials this is for you i am very sensitive to certain materials and this i was having a reaction to so be careful but the product is great and looks real and theis fantastic i got 5 rose gold colored rings they are beautiful i can not blame the small size to get on your lip although because it makes the product more secure when on so overall i am very satisfied and give this product 5 stars,185,20
217,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i absolutely love them came 7 days early and even although u can not pick the colors i received two red two pink and one purple sense i do not fancy pink i just used nail polish and painh the pink ones black and held them till they were dry enough to set down and then when dry i put a clear coat on and they look like they came black i also altered purple to silver and then to blue i just used nail polish remover and then changed theso super simple and i totally recommend them do not threat if u do not get the right,108,21
218,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i just got these in today I have had multiple piercings in the past and my skin always rejected them so this is a great alternative for me it came with 1 black 1 green 1 pink and 2 red rings they are comfortable and easy to use and look like the real things great to use as a nose ring lip ring or septum ring,65,22
219,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are a little uncomfortable but they work fine for fake piercings also that you do not chose your own colors which sucks and they took a while to get here but they are good,32,23
220,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,they came in way before he estimated time slot and every time someone noticed it they thought it was real perfect for pranks or to see if you want to get the real thing in the future i am very satisfied even although i only got silver which is thei wanted,53,24

228,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,took less than a month to get here i got three black one red and one green perfect i am 100 pleased with my order they do hurt slightly but it goes away after time or either with some distraction i am wearing mine for a septum piercing and i find it will feel better if i take it out and turn it around so the flat silver part is on the other side of my nose i have had them for about 3 days and so far no hole in my nose,93,32
229,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i originaly thought they would come in assorted colors but they all came in this really nice light purpleso I am not that upset as for wearing the actual product itself it feels a little painful when you wear it for long periods of time i wore it as a lip piercing and it felt a little weird after an hour or twoi could talk just fine but i could not drink with a straw because it would shift around uncomfortably but the feelings easy to ignore if you distract yourself from it,95,33
230,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,i wish all the colors that were shown in the picture were what you received,17,34
231,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,most of them were broken when they came in the mail,11,35
232,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,you do not get 5 different colors and they break very easy not worth your money,15,36
233,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,highly recommend for anyone not wanting to have to pierce looks real and easy to use,16,37
234,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,one of the worst things I have bought on amazon tiny rings and no variety i read the reviews and they said mostly got silver I am like oh ok I am cool with silver nope i only got all pink i hate pink these are completely useless to me do not waste your money find another seller,53,38
235,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these hurted just a lil but i forgot about it aftrer a while,13,39

238,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,i am so disappointed in these not only were they only pink and white when i was led to believe there were multiple colors especially what i really wanted which was black but 3 of them were completely broken and would not spring shut one of them the inner part was completely out of I shall be going to a different sender next time they were cheaply made and way bigger than expected,70,42
239,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,it is pretty good just hurts after a while,8,43
240,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these are awesome they look very real and I have been convincing everyone i meet the only problem is that the rings really pinch your skin but you do not feel it after a while i also did not get muchvariety i only received 3gold and 2 black rings which is completely fine with me i can not complain because those colors make the rings look even more real but otherwise they are great i also received it about 3 weeks earlier than expected,81,44
241,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i bought some of these and they do not hurt and they did not put a hole on you no matter where you put them i wore them all day long on my lip because that is where the original piercing is and ther was no hole left by these fake ones the reason i wore this was because i was taking a break from my real piercings i was quite comfortable with these and i will buy them again,78,45
242,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i only got blue and purple but other than that they are great,13,46
243,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,slow shipping and it hurts too much when i wear it and it is easy to lose,16,47
244,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are perfect for what i wanted them for and they look very good the only problem was that they did not come in multiple colors just five blue ones if the lack of different colors does not bother you then i would definitely recommend these,43,48

247,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,although they make a good fake septum piercing it came with 4 pinks and a red was really hoping i would get one in eachas advertised in the picture,30,51
248,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,it took a while but i got them they are easy to use but i guess it is too big for my lip i use them as nose piercing i lost 2 1 does not quite work and the other 2 are the ones that work well as soon as i got them i wiped them with rubbing alcohol just in cade,60,52

254,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,these earnings are really cute they are a little difficult to maneuver at first but you get the hang of them very quickly the quality is wonderful for the price i highly recommend this,35,58
255,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i was kind of dissapointed that they gave me all silver but it freaked my mom out which i wanted,20,59
256,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,do not buy came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored,11,60
257,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,i recieved 6 but they came in pairs of three colors pink red and silver it was not a problem however i wanted silver ones and the price of this was great so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra they came in a small package the delivery was fast and overall i consider this to be a good purchase,62,61
258,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,just got mine in the mail 4 gold 1 silver not the colors i wanted but can easily change theby using nail polish or markers and they fit perfectly for my nose a bit tight on the lip tho but works great,44,62
259,All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,all the earrings that i got were pink i wanted multicolored,11,63

261,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,sponges are very soft perfect for blending they do expand when wet just a bit cleaner works great too,19,0
262,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,great product for a great price easy to clean and good product,12,1
263,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,they are ok a little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult,17,2
264,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,gave it 4 stars because the product is good but i found out I am not a fan of sponges for applying makeup i like brushes better,26,3
265,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,four stars because thought they would be bigger overall there okay i still need to try them out so I shall update in a few,26,4
266,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,not worth a penny sponges broke off handles within days do not waste your money,14,5
267,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,good price but not very good quaility in this sense you kind of get what you pay for sponges are very stiff,22,6
268,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these sponge brushes make blending my facial makeup a breeze every time i need to do a heavy contour i reach for these brushes rather than my beauty blender i find this product easier to manipulate they are sturdy and well built and everything arrived intact the makeup brush cleaner is also very very useful i was easy to see when a brush was truly clean due to the residual makeup being very visible against the purple silicon this bundle is a great value for the price and i would definitely recommend this product if you frequently contour or blend your facial makeup,103,7
269,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,only one of these sponges i was satisfied with and that was the teardrop the other two seemed a bit flimsy when i used the cleaningthat came with the sponges it tore through the sponges so i am no longer able to use them not very satisfied with this product wish it was of better quality,58,8
270,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like i want,17,9
271,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,one of the pieces was not entirely glues on and broke off when i was applying makeup to it but everything else was fine,23,10
272,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,cheap handle came out of all of them,8,11
273,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,waste of money too small to evenly spread anything and soaks up all my product,15,12
274,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful they were smaller than i expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator blendor they get the job done and i love them,36,13
275,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,it feel a little to harsh for my face,9,14
276,All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,brushes are poorly made and fell apart after only using it twice,12,15

281,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it really lasts so i love it it can withstand food drinks washing rubbing and more it lasts on my lips for more than 24 hours so it is worth a shot,30,3
282,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,nothing looks like what i saw in youtube / facebook,8,4
283,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,does not peel off well gets stain all over fingers lightstays on for few hours at most not worth the money sadly a disappointment it did make for a funny facebook live post because it does not work like it should,41,5
284,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i did not like the tintit was too light the lipstick stain did not lady as promised,18,6
285,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,these are great before going out to a big event it is very pigmented and it will literally stay on all day i usually apply mine with just a little lip brush and let it dry completely before peeling it off thelasts all day without having to worry about reapplying anything else,53,7
286,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is not long lasting at all once you drink or eat it just disappear,15,8
287,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it was not a rich red like the advertisements show also would horribly stain my teeth,15,9
288,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,the top almost popped off at first use the applicator part had a rough piece of plastic so could not smooth it onto my lips super funny texture and unfortunately left a weirdi really wanted to like it but it was horrible on all accounts,46,10
289,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i bought two different colors of these i am that girl that hates wearing stuff on my lips and reapplying throughout the day these are great i use a small lip brush to apply that i bought cheap from cvs make sure your lips are mosturized before using apply it slowly covering lips and do not close your mouth and let lips touch until dry it will look funny but do not worry i let it dry for about 5 - 10 minutes then peel off it looks great i sometimes put chapstick over top of it if i want that shiny gloss look after about 6 hours it starts to wear off for me but it will be different for everyone i love these for nights out or events where i do not want to keep reapplying lipstick plus my husband loves it bc he can kiss me without transfer and i can eat and drink with no problem last pic i posted was after 4 hours of it on and eating lunch cherry red was applied that day i recommend to all the lazy girls that still want to look great,187,11
290,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this does what it is supposed to do note that if your skin is dry peeling off this lip treatment may hurt a bit so i just rubbed with tissue paper,31,12
291,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,love theof this product i just do not like how it is hard to get on evenly,17,13
292,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,the stain did not work for me but it worked for my mother I am confused on the product,18,14
293,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,it worked kind of it did not peel well was to thin to grab easy andwiped mostly off after and the rest only lasted anor 2was pretty and it was cheap,36,15
294,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it does what a stain does in the begging a little goes along way once you get to the end then it is a little stickier but overall pretty good,30,16
295,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,it is very pigmented really hard to put on it is sticky and takes a long time to put on but overall it is really good i like it,26,17
296,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,very hard to apply very hard to wait 20 minutes for the tint to dry the tint also did not actually peel off but i had to rub it and finally rub a damp towel over my lips to get off all the pieces thewas lighter than i expected and it was not long lasting,57,18
297,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is impossible to get a clean line the container was approximately 25 full so you had to tip the head back and tube upright in order to get the goo out thus no mirror view because you are looking at the ceiling took over a month to arrive and it totally sucked it deserves no stars,57,19
298,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it does not go on easily too clumpy and stiky,9,20
299,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,takes to long to work then just looks like i ate something red,13,21
300,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,shipping took like a month and it does not work good it does not stay that long it taste nasty you are better off buying a lipstain,25,22
301,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,coolbut deff not as easy to put on as we see in videos ends up on teeth n stains your fingers but does leave a nice stain on lips when everything else is cleand up,35,23
302,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i love theof waterproof lipstick that does not get on anything but this one does it was soo liquidy pretty sure that is not how it is supposed to be and the top part was torn off but i fixed that after a long time of keeping it on my lips i pealed it and the lipstick did not take affect at all i was really disappointed this is not how it is advertised,72,24
303,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,my daughter uses this occasionally and likes it,8,25
304,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip and gets on teeth when i smile,23,26
305,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,cuteand staun but is really messy,8,27
306,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,eh there are much better brands this is loaded with chemicals and i can not help but feel like i am doing my body a disservice it takes a lot of time and patience to get on evenly and just is not worth it,42,28
307,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit this brand peels off nicely,18,29
308,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i bought two of these the red one is completly unusable it is so clumpy does not go on smooth the taste of this product is gross i would not buy again,31,30
309,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,owmygee my liptint arrived this morning and it is so nice it look so good on my lips so happy for this product surely going to get another one,27,31
310,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i loved this product it works quickly and almost instantly at first i did not know if this was the peel off one but it was and it stayed in for te whole day i strongly recommend this,37,32
311,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it was in perfect condition when i recieved it and it arrived like a week sooner than expected theis just what i wanted and really lasts all day i love it,33,33
312,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i like the product but i do recommend using a lip brush rather than just the squeeze tube for a more precise and even application,25,34
313,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it is super messy to put on and really really sticky i had to apply it like every hour because thecame off very quickly and the my upper lip did not not get the samemy bottom lip did very sad it does not work on my skin,50,35
314,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,these are not meant for tan to dark skin ladies i think my lips are somewhat dark so you can barely see theon my lips i picked out the darkest shade too but it is still too light for a tan girl like me,45,36
315,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,love theand it is final look a little bit sticky when putting on but easy to peel of do not hurt at all highly recommended took 1 month to arrive,30,37
316,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,do not waste your money this stuff is horrible it got all over the place and stains everything fingers teeth cabinets consitancy of product is awful has huge globs that come out seriously do not waste your money,36,38
317,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love this product it was super new the shipping was way faster than i had thought it would be the product got here in perfect shape overall the lip colored stayed on all day i would recommend you to buy this,45,39
318,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,applying lipsticks would not be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo,11,40
319,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,this is a terrific little addition to the make-up case it is a little challenging to use the first time but after some trial and error it works great first you should use a cotton swab to apply it this gives you a lot more control which is important as this is intended to stain and does it takes a while to dry and you must keep your mouth open or you will have a mess on your hands cotton balls under your tongue help help with the extra saliva not attractive but effective you can also use a hair dryer to speed up the process however the longer it stays on the better the results interpreting it off use a nail brush to scrub your hands if you keep coconut oil on hand it works great for removal on average thelasts around 8 - 10 hours with eating drinking and smoking I have recommended this to several friends and my sister and will definitely be purchasing more,165,41
320,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,terrible it feels like chalk on your lips,9,42
321,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,just received mine was very excited I am not allergic to anything put this product on my lips it is was burning and made my lips swollen will never try this product again,31,43
322,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love it i ordered the cherry red it is so pretty and peeling it off was oddly fun and satisfying it came super early and in great condition it is a little smaller than i thought but it is worth it the application was fairly easy and it looks kinda messy but the end result is gorgeous,57,44
323,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,seems like it would work really well but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency,19,45
324,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,i can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect,12,46
325,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,too thick to put on properly was hard to get out of the bottle the top is poorly made so if you have to push hard enough to get the product out which comes out in a giant messy blob it popped off and stained my nails and hands worst mess i ever paid for and if you get your lips wet the stain never stops rubbing off it stains your lips but it is a dry mess also do not use with your favorite lip gloss it will put theall over your wand,95,47
326,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,this product is alright it does drain the lips however it goes on clumpy and sticky and it looks like you became a vampire and have blood on your lips it takes forever to dry and it does not peel off like it is supposed to i would not recommend it also if you have cuts on your lips it may burn use with caution,63,48
327,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I am pretty satisfied with this product it is a bit tricky to apply because it is gooey so you have to apply in a quick swift motion i watched a tutorial on an application suggestion and that helped i left it on for 10 min and it dried with awesome results it delivered a nice deep cherry red it even stayed on even after eating dinner i would buy this again,71,49
328,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it works really well easy to apply if you just take your time and lasts a long time it also came earlier than expected,24,50
329,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it looks like i drank some cherry kool-aid and it stained my lips red it is nearly impossibly to get it all the same shade it is super splotchy plus you can not stay in the lines of your lips well at all and it takes like 30 minutes to fully dry definitely not an on the go lipyou need a mirror and about 30 minutes to apply and let dry not impressed at all,74,51
330,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,overall thelasts a long time on your lips but it takes a long time for the product to dry on your lips and after you peel it off which is a mess it just looks like I have had a glass of red kool-aid,45,52
331,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,highly recommended it is not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil aloe natural fruit essence and also with vitamin e i have very sensitive lips so i choose the lipstick that i am using jeny,39,53
332,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,it is thick and messyimpossible to apply properly the way you would any other lipstick or lipstain there are much better choices i would not buy it again,27,54
333,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i love this product i got it in cherry red and the finish was like a beautiful bright red lipstick and it is a pretty good sized tube I have only had it on for about an hour but it has not come off at all and it feels like you have nothing on my only issue was that some of it was leaking out of the sides of the top but it did not drip on anything or make a mess when applying so it was not a big deal I have been trying out different lip stains to recommend one to my best friend for her upcoming wedding and this is definitely at the top of the list,115,55
334,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,very bad product tathurt my lips and blood came when i remove,12,56
335,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i got the cherry red i really like it isthe longer you have it on the darker it gets i really like it a lot,26,57
336,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,i think mine came defective the gloss came out of the tube extremely thick almost like old glue it was virtually impossible to apply theis pretty in the end but the mess is not worth it,38,58
337,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,so although it is messy to apply it really works and does not leave lips dry just put some chapstick after application and your lips will look beautiful,29,59
338,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,zero stars i was not happy with it at all i first seen it on facebook and it looked like something i would like but no i was safly wrong came late hard to put on dries way to fast and it does not taste very good,45,60
339,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it provides long lastingand safety on my lips every time i use it,15,61
340,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i like this lipstick the only bad thing it is that is not very easy to apply the smell is delicious i would recommended if would be easier to apply and if it would not dry fast,35,62
341,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i live how it stays on all day,8,63
342,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,love it but it makes a big mass,8,64
343,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it is pretty cool it came perfect and theis nice i will definitely purchase again super glad i bought this,22,65
344,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,a great value and a terrificpayoff to be honest the only issue i had was waiting for the product because it did arrive a month late which does not surprise me since it only cost 3,37,66
345,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,i received it today and tried it on and live it perfectit looks great,16,67
346,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,pros works really really well i applied it last night around 8 pm to try it out peeled it off and was left with a beautiful stain did not bother washing it off before bed and woke up this morning with beautiful lips and no transfer on my pillow either cons it tastes really bad like there is something extremely bitter in the gloss before you peel it off and if you do not get all the pieces off right away it lingers on your lips and has a horrible bitter taste but i mean it is not meant to be ingested or licked like a lip gloss is so maybe that was my fault would i buy it again absolutely shipping was decent i ordered it the 26th of december and got it on the 4th of january,135,68
347,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,excellent receive the product in a perfect condition,8,69
348,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,as soon as i tried squeezing the product out applicator popped off and all of the product came out plus someone previously opened it because the safety seal was broken,30,70
349,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,super disappointed with this goes on the inside of my mouth when that is obviously not where I am placing it super icky and the stains i try to clean off from inside of my mouth causes the entire stain to be removed,41,71
350,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,went on thick and gloppy ugh not easy to apply at all very disappointed i do not recommend it,19,72
351,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,theis lighter than expected and does not stay longer,11,73
352,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,feels like glue and i do not know if it is toxic my teeth are pink s,15,74
353,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,nice kinda hard to rub an lips but it so awsome love the resolts,14,75
354,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,i like the fact that this lip tint gives you a vibrant natural rid lip tint it smells good but taste horrible I am glade i bought it it works with every skin tone including women ofladies i recommend this product,42,76
355,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,could not stand the feel of it while it was drying it grossed me out,15,77
356,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,do not use this unless you have a very steady hand and are possibly a professional makeup artist my sister gave me some and i thought it was lip gloss got some out of the lines as it were and yes it definitely lasts my hands and lips and in general the lower half of my face have been bright red for hours now if you can get it where you want it I am sure it would be a lasting and lovely lipbut you really need to get it on perfect the first time or you end up looking like a toddler who ate a crayon,108,78
357,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,it is a really cool concept the application however is a mess i would recommend using a qtip or lip gloss applicator versus just using it directly from the tube the stain does not turn out that red once it is peeled off it honestly looks like you just ate a popsicle so if you are into that look this product is for you overall it requires too much time to put on i have used it twice in the year that i have had it,83,79
358,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,does not seem to be something i would wear long time and the material does not seem to stay on or look a certain way,24,80
359,All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,worst product i have ever purchased in my life not only is this a sloppy mess that does not really work but it burns to put on,26,81
390,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,either i received the wrongor they are knowingly sending out something completely different i received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them no flowers or leaves at all and the beads do not even look like the little ones in the picture either so I am getting a refund for this disappointment,54,0
391,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,when i ordered these the description said silver the ones i got were gold they have since changed the description still i was not happy,25,1
392,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,the gold on these pins is very yellowy gold i initially did not like theat all but they ended up being pretty in my hair so i wore them anyway for my wedding,34,2
393,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding the pins looked very cute i wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette and i gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well the pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding great product for a good price,66,3
394,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold overall it looked great and is reusable,26,4
395,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,I am actually pretty happy with these they are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I am not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy but overall it is not a huge issue they still look so pretty i used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well i plan to use them for my wedding now as well i do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well but i could not find them anywhere,89,5
396,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,i was looking forward to these and in the silver / white version and instead i got this ugly yellow golddisappointed will not use these,25,6
397,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,i got these to match my jewelry and maid of honor and they were perfect i loved them and they stood out nicely against my blonde hair they stayed in really well throughout the night and i got multiple compliments on them,42,7
398,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,these hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day during my trial my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle i bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair we decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive these hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost i definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day,103,8
399,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the metal had a cheap look to it did not end up wearing it,13,9
400,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,they are very beautiful and of good quality unfortunately i only received 2 out of the 3 pins the package looked like it had been returned overall beautiful,28,10
401,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,2.0,negative,the gold is very cheap looking i wanted these for my wedding but they look bad,16,11
402,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,i ordered these for my wedding day and they worked great easily adjustable to perfect your look and such a nice but simple embellishment,24,12
403,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,the goldis very gold almost cartoonish gold but i have dark hair and the accentfor my wedding is gold so it will work out fine but it was a bit of a shock when i first saw it quality product,43,13
404,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the gold reminded me of willy wonka gold,8,14
405,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,wore these for my wedding took forever to arrive but looked very nice,13,15
406,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,so cute i love them and so cheap good for bohemian look,13,0
407,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,they were really cute but left my fingers green,9,1
408,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,leaves a small green lining on your fingers but that should be expected for how cheap it is the green is not even noticeable if you leave the rings on and one did break within 2 weeks sadly but I am still loving the others,43,2
409,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,i would have gave it five stars but one of the rings bent not that it was a problem because i fixed it like that but still not the best quality,31,3
410,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,just like a set of forever 21 rings,8,4
411,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,great gift good variety of rings with a nice finish worth the money by far,15,5

413,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,it did take forever to arrive but what can i expect it was super cheap and i think also free shipping I am very satisfied with the quality of the rings,30,7
414,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,they were broken before i got the chance to open the bag,12,8
415,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,all the rings are different sized and some fit some do not,11,9
416,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,the rings snapped easily and the midi rings were not very adjustable,11,10
417,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,i totally thought these would be cute for the summer / pool / beach i would not want to take these in the water the paint on it is all chipped and cracking there were 2 pieces that had jagged metal sticking out from the ring area 3 pieces were adjustable and 3 were not the ones that were not adjustable fit on my knuckles and we are not comfortable the metal is garbage the paint is chipping and the sizing is weird i might be able to use a couple as toe rings not worth what i paid for them,96,11
418,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,came in as pictures the material is not flimsy cute rings,10,12
419,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,they are made out of plastic reminds me of costume jewelry for a 4 year old,16,13
420,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,so i received my rings early which was a big plus they came in a small package and i was very pleased to see that they were perfect although the rings seem to have the black paint chips or something like that stuck on the inside,46,14
421,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,they are cute they are super affordable they are just little trinkets after all i got mine to hopefully spruce up some shots of manicures / nail art I am doing for me not to wear for real,34,15
422,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,poorly made broke as i put them on the first time cute style it it was made out of something else dont waste your money,25,16
423,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,only one of them broke and i did not like that one anyway laughing out loud they are surprisingly sturdy for what you are paying they are all different sizes after a while thestarts to get a little coppery these rings are pretty good for the price,43,17
424,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,i like them but they came it says it came in from wish,13,18
425,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these are okay cheap metal so potential breaking,8,19
426,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,these are really cute they kind of bend but it does not seem to be a bad thing one of them bent almost all the way open while i was running around at work but it did not break as far as accent rings go they serve their purpose paint them with clear nailpolish so the will not make your fingers green,59,20
427,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,these rings are a cute design but the quality is that of a quarter prize machine at a grocery store save your money and wrap tinfoil around your fingers,29,21
428,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,these rings are very cheap the metal is almost plastic-like the designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped only three of the six were sanded leaving sharp burs on the other three i am dissapointed but contented with the few rings of the set i can wear i would still buy from this seller as their service is wonderful and everything else I have bought from them has been excellent,76,22
429,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,i was so excited when i received these they are such a cute design but they are so poorly made that one of them broke at a weak welding / soldering point less than 3 hours after putting it on,38,23
430,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,plastic like not what i expected most of them broke you get what you pay for,16,24
431,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,love these little rings but you get what you pay for all the open / adjustable rings break within the first two wears the solid bands are a bit stronger realize these are a trendy short term accessory,36,25
432,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,very very poor quality all the rings broke and crumbled after 2 days,13,26
433,All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,broke the second i pulled them out of the package,10,27
434,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i was skeptical at first but i love azorro hair brush straightener it works super amazing wish it would let me post my picture with the before and after well worth the money and support is amazing,34,0
435,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,my hair is quite short so i use this on my top layers with much success on the shorties underneath i still have to hit it with the flat iron as my hair grows back out to chin length i look forward to only needing this brush it is quicker and effective,51,1
436,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,purchased this about 2 weeks ago and needed to give a review on it i really like it a lot it is a great addition to my styling products so it has a great feature of shut offing if it is not in use for a long time it heats up in seconds and keeps the temperature constant i love how it makes my hair look and feel i can do my hair in seconds,73,2
437,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,was not the same brush shown in the picture did not work when plugged in sent it back,16,3
438,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,horrible did not work and burnt my hair do not bother,9,4
439,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,pulled out my hair and did not straighten at all,10,5
440,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,does not work on curly hair as it states,9,6
441,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,this works great it is much better than a regular flat iron,12,7
442,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,heavy and awkward to use you almost can not use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings it does make a little difference but not enough to really notice the bristles will scratch your neck if not careful would not buy again,43,8
443,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i really like this brush and despite the fact that my hair is short it still worked quite well 10/10 would recommend to a friend,25,9
444,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,the product inside the box seemed like a duplicate brush did not have the temperature indicator on it plus did not even work when plugged in,26,10
445,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,hair does not get as straight as advertised it seems to snag african american hair,14,11
446,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,unbelievable piece of junk i used it maybe six times i wrote them and explained the condition of their product to them and they ignored me,26,12
447,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,tangles hair too much other than that great product,9,13
448,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,this hair brush did not work for me and i would like to send it back,16,14
449,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,i was not sure this would work since i have extremely thick curly hair so here it goes it does work i let my hair dry naturally and used the ionic hair brush it really did work but not as well as my flat iron the pros is that is great for touchand it is easy to use this will be my everyday straightening tool but when i want pin straight hair i will continue to use my flat iron the cons is that my daughters have already taken it over and i may have to order another one for myself,103,15
450,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,love this product it heats quickly easy to use and provides great results worth the price,16,16
451,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,too heavy and bulky and I have burnt myself several times using it i only used it 4 times now it is collecting dust,21,17
452,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,it works a bit better than i expected still experimenting,10,18
453,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,great for straightening your hair i use a comb just to get tangles out prior to the use but like it better then a flat iron,26,19
454,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,like it just not pleased with the number of the heat overall it is good,14,20
455,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,did not work and my hair is not even curly just wanted it to smooth,13,21
456,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,works good on hair that is not too naturally curly,9,22
457,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,this brush works amazing on my course dry hair i only need to run it thru once and move to the next section of hair there is 1 draw back the buttons to raise and drop the temp are on the side where your fingers are when using it,49,23
458,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,easy to use and i get great results which is important to me since i have very coarse frizzy kinky unmanageable hair,22,24
459,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,it was a gift for our daughter she tried it but it did not work on her hair it left it as frizzy as it was before she started,28,25
460,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,it really works great but the only problem i have is the buttons should be in a different place because i held it i was also either adjusting it up or down and off because my hand presses the buttons as i held it to do my hair other then that i do like it,55,26
461,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,not impressed i have short hair with swoopy ends the brush is not able to do my ends at all,20,27
462,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,perfect it is a bit difficult to use on shorter hair but i did expect that,16,28
463,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,not happy with the quality of this product at all and being i paid so much for it makes me even the more unhappy,24,29
464,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,i ended up returning it it was so big and bluky and it did not stop the frizz it actually made my hair more frizzy but the company was really great with my return and if you have thick hair this would probably be perfect,46,30
465,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,i am so happy that i bought this it really does straighten your hair and is so much less time consuming than a hair straightener,25,31
466,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,it is an excellent concept but this brush just does not get hot enough to do my hair and i had it maxed at 415 i have thick long and kind of wavy hair and when i read the manual for the recommended heat and i had it maxed at 415 and it took a good 10 times through the same section to get it even mildly straight plus i believe it states that it is static free def not,77,32
467,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,i had some difficulty using the brush if my hair was not 100 dry and tangle free when using the brush i kept touching the temperature controls and changing the temperature i got this brush so that i could straiten my hair everyday but it is a bit to difficult to do that,51,33
468,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,it takes half the time to straighten my hair and not get burned,14,34
469,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,good morning i live in brasil and i boughy on my vacation after30 days it is broken and o use only 3 4 times i sent this product to my son he lives um united states is ir possble to change,42,35
470,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,works great my daughter has curly hair and this straightened it qith minimal frizz,14,36
471,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,i purchased 3 two for me and 1 as a gift i hope it works but i used mine 1 time each they both stopped working amazon refunded my money and i bought a better unit thanks amazon,37,37
472,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,i was really disappointed in this hot hair brush the power button is right in the middle of the handle where your hand naturally is placed when using the brush so you are constantly turning it off super poor design i had been looking for a brush that was actually a hot tool rather than just a hot air brush but i noticed that it took way more effort to straighten my long thick hair with this than with a flat iron it would not tolerate very much hair in the bristles which is discouraging because the brush head is rather large even after straightening with a flat iron using the brush to give it some lift body and/or curl i just could not make it happen without investing much more time than i had patience,137,38
473,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,it broke one week later when my aunt used it it is basically a blowdryer,14,39
474,All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,gave as a gift did not get hot enough,8,40
475,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,very very dim also thetemperature of the lights are cool blue wish i could return,17,0
476,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,this is such an awesomei do not have a real makeup vanity to put everything on and also do my makeup i hung this on the wall right next to where i have my makeup stored and it is perfect for doing my makeup or eyebrows it has a light so it is very easy to see the one side is magnified so it is easy to see when you are plucking eyebrows or eyeliner i put it up so the installation is very easy i received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,99,1
477,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,the amount and quality of the light provided by the thin strip that encircles the mirror is inadequate a good source of light from somewhere else close to your face is needed the hardware works well easy installation looks stylish useable area of mirror on the small side,48,2
478,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,just like in the hotel very nice and makes me feel pampered no more leaning way over the counter to see in the mirror and i love that it pushes back out of the way i would recommend this mirror lights up nicely i did receive a discount to review thisand this is my honest opinion not biased,60,3
479,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,supporting hardware does not seem very sturdy but it works very well mirror functions perfectly my problem is the lighting which i needed for shaving in a dark location i could use a brighter light hence a 4 against 5 batteries were not difficult to install overall a goodproduct,50,4
480,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,disappointed when i pull it out to use it will not stay in place,14,5
481,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,terrible product the quality of this mirror is awful i bought this after my old wall-mounted mirror fell and broke and i thought the light would be great the light flickers and will not stay on and even for the few moments it is on it is so dim it is worthless i have taken it apart twice and replaced the batteries not easy to do either and no improvement the mirror surface is also pretty small and magnification is not good i tried emailing the seller twice to see if my unit was just defective but they never bothered to reply,101,6
482,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,i love this mirror i did not want to spend a ton it does exactly what i need it to looks great too,22,7
483,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,wall extension seems flimsy but i never got far enough to find out the battery case extremely difficult to twist open once it is the edges of the open case are sharp yep it cut me returned for refund,39,8
484,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror was easy to install and works fine but the reason we bought it was the lighting the leds are very dim and almost useless,26,9
485,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,mine appears to be defective needed a wrench to screw the part that holds on the mirror i could not do it myself also very difficult to take the mirror apart for battery installation,33,10
486,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the product appeared to be exactly what i was looking for but two weeks into ownership one of the brackets on one of the hinges broke there really is not kind of hack or easy fix either appears to be shoddy materials and/or manufacturing,43,11
487,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,was what i wanted and worked great,8,12
488,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,broke rivit so need to send back,8,13
489,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,the screw jackets are hard to install but i do not fault the manufacturer for that i think it is my walls overall great purchase,23,14
490,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror is just fine however the perimeter light is so soft or low that it is pointless do not buy this product for the light feature you will be disappointed,28,15
491,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirrors and extension are great the light is worthless,10,16
492,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,got this for my 92 year old dad so he can see better to shave works well and arrived on time,21,17
493,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,now i can see myself without my glasses,9,18
494,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the mirror is far too heavy for the extension arm and it is very wobbly i could never get the mirror case open to insert batteries so i can not rate the usefulness of the lighted feature,35,19
495,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,good quality mirrors both the plain and magnifying sides good quality construction the light leaves something to be desired,19,20
496,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,very flimsy and takes a long time to balance also poor lighting,13,21
497,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,great mirror the light is worthless do not buy it if you need a light,14,22
498,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,light is not bright magnification not good will give away,10,23
499,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,impossible to open the mirror to install the batteries i guess i have to return it worthless,17,24
500,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,works for our small bathroom not as bright as i hoped,11,25
501,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,it was a bit hard to open to get the batteries in but once done the light is really quite bright not sure why others said the opposite installation was very easy and it seems well made not at all flimsy,41,26
502,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,this product is heavy as it is expected to be but the screws and the mounts they give you need to be better i have this horrible fear that the cheap drywall screws that came with it are going to break and i am going to end up with 7 years bad luck the mirror is beautiful although and the led is just bright enough that i can use it and not be blinded by it like some mirror lights overall i probably would buy it again I had just invest in a better mounting screw set,97,27
503,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,the led light is not as strong as it sounds like it should be the construction is not all that sturdy either the mirror part is wobbly and I am always afraid it is just going to fall off onto the floor,38,28
504,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,this mirror works great the light is not too bright,10,29
505,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,this has never worked the switch is bad and it will occasionally flicker but will not stay on,18,30
506,All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,all in all it is decent for what it mainly is a mirror the magnification is exactly what i was looking for the light was a perk but it is not very bright and really does not light up anything extra that my bathroom light does not so i do not really use it the arm is a little loose from where it attaches to the wall it swings slowly back towards the wall but this could be from how it is mounted but basically it works just fine for what i need it for,89,31
556,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,kinda cheap and i got an uglynot going to be getting anymore these are for toddlers,17,0
557,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,that i received was not listed but i still like it it took a long while to arrive but it was still cute when i received it there has a wire going through the cloth so you can manipulate it all you like and it stays on fairly well however beware that when the wire breaks you basically have to throw it out or remove the wire,66,1
558,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,love it i wish you could choose the colors although i received a polka dot black and white and polka dot teal and white,24,2
559,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,this is cheap and a waste of money,8,3
560,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,this is nice i just wish i could choose the colors,11,4
561,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,really cute but was a different material than i expected it to be i think it is satin,17,5
562,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,you are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be alisted not worth the money,21,6
563,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,it is a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it is supposed to be,36,7
564,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2.0,negative,i got some ugly funkyand while it looks cute on me it is really small i have a rather big head and so it does not reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model it is also made of cheap wire so be careful with it,53,8
565,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,I am very disappoined i ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material what am i going to do with three of the exact same headband,27,9
566,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,it came a lot earlier than expected i just wish i could have chosen theof headband,17,10
567,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,it is okay for the price got it sooner then expected wire started to poke out as soon as i put it on but easy to fix wish i could pick thebut i still love the one i got it is tan with orange dots,46,11
568,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,do not like it at all from the looks of the pic it was suppose to be one of the denim headbands and i received a light pink polka dot one i have no use for it,37,12
569,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,very cute but i do wish i could have chose the,11,13

573,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,it came quickly and works great i got one that was cream with dark pink polka dots,17,17
574,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,all I shall say about this is i believe it is meant for kids not adults,15,18
575,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,really thought these were coming as a set was really disappointed to receive 1 single head band,17,19
576,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the maroonis nice and the blue is not bad but i will not use the other two now that i know that the magnet does not work i was really sad to figure out it did not work but it still was not a bad price for the maroon and blue and they look okay without the magnet feature,56,0
577,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i love theand everything but when i opened it half of it was spilled everywhere and i could only use the red and silver extremely disappointed i love the other colors and it wears nicely but i just really do not like the fact half of my order was unusable,51,1
578,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,i love the colors but the magnet did not work at all good thing i had ordered another magnet to go with these i tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked,39,2
579,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,problem was not with the polish itself it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all i tried everything so i am disappointed,27,3
580,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,i recieved the package and they looked fine i did not open the individualboxes when i recieved it since it was a gift for my niece when she opened them the next day one of the bolttle was broken from the top andwas leaking out and starting to dry already the others worked great i just wish that the other one was not broken,67,4
581,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,i do not recommend it it is clumpy and hard to put on cleanly,12,5
582,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,love this magnetic polish i have worn the silver / gray magnetic for just a day and already receiving complements on the shimmer,21,6
583,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,this product is terrible i tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work the polish is clumpy like it has sand in it or something so it can not be used as regular polish either i tested the gold and the blue very very disappointed i would have asked for a refund but i bought them awhile ago and am just now trying them,67,7
584,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
585,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i got a 3d magnet gel polish i tried them on my nails i work at nails salon and i know how to use that the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality seem they had sands inside and can not work at all especially the silver and gold one i will never buy it anymore bad and bad,63,9
586,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,looks great and simple to apply just hold the magnet for longer then the 10 seconds it recommends roughly 30 seconds and it works nice,25,10
587,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i was so excited for these polishes to arrive today unfortunately two of the four colors are unusable they were mostly dried into a big clump i even tried using gel thinner the other two colors worked great and the magnet worked perfectly on them,45,11
588,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,i love this polish it is beautiful and exactly as described the shipping as fast and the seller is super nice,20,12
589,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,beautiful colors do not think the magnetic thing woks well but the colors make up for it,15,13
590,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,beautiful colors the cat eye does not seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me I shall practice more update after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4 i kept them in the original box all the time so it was not light that was cutting them,59,14
591,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i purchased came quickly two of the products look as if they had been previously opened the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out i give 2 stars one for each good product the blue and silver,40,15
592,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i bought these solely for the star shaped magnet i found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish I am going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if i can get the desired results still holding out hope on that i can not give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is it is lose runny and it pulls away from the nail horribly by the time i was done applying it the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that i eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing and i still had bare spots the formula is subpar the only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately which would end up being more time consuming i do not recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure so on top of the bare spots i can not even see the start mark i can not wait to scrape this off my nails,180,16
593,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,initially i ordered this product and received a duplicate colour ie blue red and two silvers instead of gold and silver however customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end i received all four colours i have used the blue red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark slate colour i have not tried the gold yet but generally i like the sensationail brand a lot,88,17
594,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this stuff is awesome the colors are very pretty and the magnetic stuff works great even comes with the little magnet wand,22,18
595,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i can not figure out how to get the magnets to work right they seem to barely work which just makes the polish look sloppy,24,19
596,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,the colors are pretty was not sure i would like the dark colors but after trying the blue i discovered they are pretty have to master the magnet although did not get it centered the first time,37,20
597,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,it took me a while to get the hang of it but this polish is quite awesome i got so many compliments on the starburst people were in awe and wondered how i did it,35,21
598,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,these were awful i love sensational products and normally they will last a week these only lasted a day or two before peeling off and the design looks nothing like what has on the package,34,22
599,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,birthday present for daughter she loved the set,8,23
600,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,there were horrible we have used other polishes by this brand and loved them but these magnetic polishes are dried out and clumpy seller would not comment back on returns such a waste as I have seen these in videos and they look like they would work great,45,24
601,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i opened the package of the blue which was completely sealed took out the brush and it was all wonky and clotted i cleaned off the mess and it was bubbly and lumpy and the brush resembled toothbrush bristles it was impossible to get a nice semi-even coat of polish with this brush then i tried the magnet thinking well at least i get a nice magnet from each of these nope did not work the gold also was clotted and wonky but not as much and the brush stiff like a toothbrush but the magnet worked on that one still not a nice bold star pattern like on the box but more like thin straight lines i do not want to open the other 2 right now because these are very smelly and I am sensitive to that i purchased these a while ago so it is past my return window or these would definitely be going back the colors were great although,160,25
602,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,do not buy i use this brand of nail polish all the time and these are very inferior compared to the norm they were clumpy goopy and completely unusable when i went to request a return it said these items not eligible for a return either old or used but either way do not waste your money,58,26
603,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,terrible one bottle came with the brush bent completely up unusable another bottle came with hardly any polish in it at all my daughter was very disappointed the other 2 bottles were fine and the magnet does work,38,27
604,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this was part of a gift and she loved it,10,28
605,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,horrible this stuff was crap the magnetic properties were a joke if i could rate it a 0 i would 2 out of the 4 bottles were a dried out mess of goo beauty brags said that they would send me 2 new bottles or reimburse i got nothing from them do not purchase this junk,53,29
630,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,what a piece of crap this is i have 2 6 mon old kittens one sniffed it and walk away and has never returned to it the other nicky tried to scracth it and it just swung around and smacked her in the face to wit she bit it and walked away made very poorly and cheapjust a piece of crappy rug glued to a piece of cardboard i should have gone where i always do [ ] or even walmart,78,0
631,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,the carpet on this is really short and the strip overall is too narrow i tried hanging it on several doorknobs and even anchoring it on the floor to no avail,31,1
632,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,it is somewhat pricey considering shipment anyway my can does not use it as intended she likes it when flat on the floor,23,2
633,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i tried it in several locations on the floor on the door and in their faces i rubbed it with catnip and tried to charm them with treats and they still looked at me like i was smoking crack what exactly do want us to do with that thing mom my girls will play with pretty much anything except this thing i went over to petco about week later and bought a super-cheapie carpet-covered 2 stand clawing post with a feather toy and the girls said now that is what we are talkin bout mom in my opinion do not waste your money,100,3
634,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cat loves her scratching pad and it was the best 5 I have ever invested chooch is not much of a scratcher she does like the side of my bed and the antique chenille sofa in my living room but she has a stretch scratcher and this scratching pad is right up her ally she would not touch it when it was hanging from a doorknob but she has very happy with it on the floor after she scratches on it she loves to sit on it as if to keep anybody else in the house from claiming it,97,4
635,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,are you kidding me cats will definitely use this thing to scratch their claws on so get one and save your sofa if only for a little while,27,5
636,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,cats pulled the looped rope off pretty fast ended up mounting it to door way they always clawed on still claw at it but not damaging my door frame now,30,6
637,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,both of my cats love this scratcher i believe they are both drawn to the scent that is infused in the scratcher i hung it on my bed post where they both like to scratch now they scratch the scratcher instead of my bed great product very inexpensive as well,50,7
638,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,for what ever reason my cats refuse to use this a carpet sample on a stiff plastic backing is all this is,22,8
639,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i knew it would be small and cheap but it is literally something you can buy at my local dollar store it is a bit thicker than cardstock with felting on it it hangs on the door knob but because it is so light the cat can not gain purchase on it to scratch it it is essentially like my cat trying to scratch a hotel do not disturb sign total waste of 750 pay double and buy something substantial this is total cheap crap,84,9
640,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,thisis exactly as described and fits well over a door handle however my cat shows zero interest in it even when i put it on the floor for easy access,33,10
641,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,disappointing cats are not interested at all sort of flimsy,10,11
642,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,greatjust can not get the cat to think so,10,12
643,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i purchased 5 of these and hung them around on the doors where my cats tended to scratch my cats push them aside and scratch on the door anyway,29,13
644,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,smaller then i expected but the cats are happy so far i will update as to how long it actually lasts in the future,24,14
645,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,my cat definitely do not like this one they prefer the ones where i can add the catnip this one is cheap but the cats will ignore it i use it on the floor in front of the litter box now,40,15
646,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,not really satisfied my cat does not like it does not seem too much like a scratch pad not long enough when hanging on door but fair price thank you,28,16
647,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,great product cats seem to prefer it on the floor rather than hanging from the door although,17,17
648,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats seriously are obsessed with this they always dig i have two unclawed cats at it and my third with claws with flip it all over and roll on it and claw into it too I am thinking about buying another one as they really just love it that much,50,18
649,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i hung it up and my cats ignored it i put it on the floor and they liked it,19,19
650,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,my cats do not even use this i sprayed some catnip mist to try to get them interested and they just go lick it and walk away maybe it is just my cats i do not know but i feel i wasted my money,42,20
651,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,i placed this directly next to the couch that the cats like to scratch most of the time they are willing to attack this instead it is not intensive scratch therapy but it is only 2 and not nearly as messy as cardboard scratch pads in the same general price range i have one on a doorknob and another one just lying on the floor two of the cats prefer the one on the floor the other one enjoys reaching up to attack the one on the door it has been six months now and the scratch pads are both still in perfect condition despite being used regularly you would never know that they are used this is the perfectif 1 your cats scratch your couch and 2 you have 33 in your cart and need a 2for free shipping,142,21
652,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats love this they finally stopped scratching my wall,10,22
653,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,wanted to break the habit of cats scratching at the door frame i hung these off of a couple of doorknobs lo and behold my cats ignore these tried rubbing catnip on the pads no luck good thing they are cheap,40,23
654,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,brought for my boyfriend cat have not gotten a chance to hang it looks like a good buy I shall let you know when they visit,24,24
655,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,this is very thin and my cat hardly pays any attention to it but it does look nice hanging on my door I am going to spray catnip on it hopefully she will use it more great for the price especially as an add on,43,25
656,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,protect your doors our cat was shredding the weatherstripping on the front door in her attempt to get our notice to let her in now she scratches on this pad and it makes enough noise that we know she is out there and can let her in it has prevented further damage i highly recommend it as it is flat and we can swing it to the side to close the door solved our problem,75,26
657,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,huh the cats completely ignore it maybe they should make scratching pads out of nice leather as that seems to be much preferred in my house to these cheapo pads oh well at least those little beasties have not discovered the woodwork and i wanted a new sofa anyway,48,27
658,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,cats have not used this even although i have multiple hanging at different locations and different heights throughout my house they would much rather use other scratchers i have,26,28
659,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,cats had no interest in it whatsoever i even tried spraying it with catnip spray very cheaply made but that is why the price was so cheap i can not hold that against them it may work for someone else but our cats were way more interested in the actual carpet and never looked twice at this scratch pad back to the drawing board,64,29
660,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,this was the most stupid cat scatcher made,8,30
661,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i should have known that hanging something lightweight would because it to swing around on the door handle when the cat tries to use it so i attached it to the carpet using velco she likes it and uses it now,41,31
662,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,for 250 what do you expect it is not the best scratch pad i ever saw but it can go anywhere hang it lay it down attach it to another surface and it does not make a mess like cardboard scratch pads it is obviously made from the scraps left over from indoor-outdoor carpeting but like i said it is well worth the money paid the only thing is some kitties might not prefer the carpet suface but that my friends is something you have to find out yourself overall aok,85,32
663,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,my cats ignored it hanging on the door and i think it was too short for them to get too once i put it on the floor they use it now,31,33
664,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,our cat quail was not interested in this i should not have bought it when i could have just attached a cord to a free carpet sample i do not hate it maybe other cats would like this style and it is very inexpensive i just do not like it because it did not work out for us,54,34
665,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats are happy to scratching on door knob i mean hanging on the door knob lols,17,35
666,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,there has not much to it but it works fine,9,36
667,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,this may be the only scratcher my cats have never touched i do not know what has wrong I have got another door-hanger scratch pad and they love that one it might be my cats although and not the scratch pad,38,37
668,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,nice scratcher for kitties who enjoy vertical surfaces for claw maintenance our new addition finally decided he liked the horizontal cardboard better which rendered this one superfluous wow do you know how long I have been waiting to call something superfluous,40,38
669,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,i used this on a door to the third floor in the home that i never leave open but the cats will let me know also when they want to go up there by scratching and i had taught them to touch the door knob when they want up there sounds crazy,52,39
670,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my cat went to right to the scratch pad just as soon as i hung it up she tried to use it an her paw nails got stuck in the carpet material she has tried it a few times and can not use it i turned it over to the back side and she will kind of use that overall pretty disappointed,61,40
671,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,pros inexpensive unobtrusive cons basically carpet on cardboard flimsy cat does not like it if you cat is obsessed with carpet then i guess this product is for you if you cat is into scratching the furniture thiswill not distract him for that i sprayed tons of catnip on it and my cat looks at me like i am nuts and on drugs spend more money and get a better cat scratch pad,75,41
672,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,well my cat loves to scratch things but this was definitely a waste of money he has never touched it sucks,20,42
673,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my two cats do not uses it good price but it did not work oft my kitties maybe it will work for yours i got 2and that was a mistake,29,43
674,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,our kitten played with it a bit but only a little bit it is too flexible to be used as a scratcher,22,44
675,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,does not attract cats at all thankfully it was inexpensive because our cats have not gone anywhere near this thing since we have bought it,24,45
676,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i have 2 hanging sisal cat scratchers and a cat tree with sisal legs that the cats use constantly i have never seen my cats touch the omega paw scratcher and the scratchers still look new,36,46
677,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,since i bought this product my cat no longer claws my furniture if you have a cat or cats i highly recommend this product,24,47
678,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,this backseat barrier kept my dogs from coming up front for about one hour until they figured out that they could just easily jump right over the top of it this might work for a very little dog or a car with an extremely low ceiling or a dog that does not have much desire to make it is way into the front seat but I am not sure why you would need this in the first place if your dog was not constantly trying to jump into the front while you are driving i thought this was going to be the answer to all of my dog transporting problems but it is just a waste of money,114,0
679,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,while the main portion of the barrier is well made it is too short and flimsy to keep my border collies and golden retreiver from jumping on top and over it the upper netting will not stay in an upright position partially because the two stabilizer bars holding it up broke the stitching holding them in place so they are now useless get the outward hound version for less than ten bucks and save some money,74,1
680,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we bought this product because our dog kept jumping into the front seat the product is a little flimsy and she can still jump over it but it is helping us train her to stay in the back it also keeps her safely contained when we have to slam on the breaks overall it is a good product but possibly a little over priced,64,2
681,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,this is a durable product that even works for big doges it is somewhat complicated to install and the top round wood rod keeps coming out so i removed it the barrier still works fine 100 effective but a little difficult,42,3
682,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,worked great for my 2014 toyota corolla i had to be creative on how i hooked up the bottom strap but it worked great kept the dogs in the back seat safe and sound,34,4
683,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i have purchased kurgo products before the quality is nice it keeps the dogs in the back seat but they can still see what is going on in the front seat,31,5
684,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this kurgo does not work with all vehicles,8,6
685,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my two goldens jumped this in a heartbeat back to drawing board this actually hindered getting them back into the back seat as they did not have as much enthusiasm going back to their seat,34,7
686,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,it was okay did not love how it fit in my car could not seem to get it secure enough now matter how much i tightened the straps,26,8
687,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this is very difficult to get attached to the seats it is flimsy so the dogs just went around it with some serious rigging you could probably get this to work or if your dogs are not very adament about sitting on your lap essentially you get what you pay for,49,9
688,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,a little complicated to get set up but i installed along with the seat cover and dog bridge works great to keep dogs in the back seat which is critical since we foster rescues,35,10
689,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,worst thing every the dogs can just pull it down and run over it,14,11
690,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,52 lb springer spaniel plowed over it guess he really wants to ride shotgun he also did not like looking thru the mesh one we tightened his back seat harness and he could see out the front window clearly he was a happier dog concept is terrific but not for us,51,12
691,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my dog had already put a hole in the mesh part of it ther than that it is a great investment if it were taller it would be better,29,13
692,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,lasted about 20 minutes then my dog chewed through the side straps and was back in the front seat,19,14
693,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,keeps my dogs in the back where they belong,9,15
694,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is fantastic being that i am 71 years old it took a little while to put it on but i am so happy with it now my dogs will be safe and i can quit worrying about them when i take them places well worth the money thank you,50,16
695,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,excellent stops our dogs from coming to visit us by standing on the armrest yet does not stop them seeing out the front window space to keep a water bowl and ball without them rolling around in the back,38,17
696,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my very athletic dog has managed to get around the barrier so not all that useful,16,18
697,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,for small or medium size vehicles bought for our 2016 ram mega cab and does not fit received product quickly but did not try to install until planning our next trip with our pets needless to say it was a few days after the return period expired reading the reviews and description sounded like it would fit wrong also noted that once installed and tight it prohibits the passenger from putting the seat back in case they want to sleep or rest would not recommend for large trucks if installed elastic bungee chords might help lowering the backrest,96,19
698,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,unfortunately this did not work with our very spoiled labs,10,20
699,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,not a perfect match for my car volvo but has enough straps and connectors that i was able to make it work anyway seems sturdy definitely deters my dog from clambering up front while I am driving,36,21
700,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,strap tore pretty quickly i am going to look into alternative options,12,22
701,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is the second type of backseat barrier that i have purchased and the only that i would recommend the construction is very sturdy particularly if you insert the optional metal bar and should hold back most dogs,38,23
702,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,quality made product my dog climbed over it in less than 5min,12,24
703,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,the rod that goes across the top for stability is too short could not get it together and,17,25

705,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,put this in my suburu outback it did fit nice but it did not hold up at all to the dogs hanging on it easily jumped over and they chewed thru the bottom connection cords it was money thrown out the window took about 10 minutes for my 25 lb cocker spaniel to destroy it,55,27
706,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,not for everyone but it works for me i have 10 dogs most are trained to stay in the back two will get in the back and immediately run through to the front this prevents them from doing that could they jump over could they destroy it yes to both but my dogs just are not motivated to do that this is doing exactly what i needed it to do it all depends onl your dogs,75,28
707,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this was made nicely but it did not fit my car very well also i wasted a lot of time because there had been a design change that was not reflected in the instructions in the box or on the web,41,29
708,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this was a christmas gift to my husband and he is very pleased with it,15,30
709,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,a big help keeping our labradoodle out of the front seat on long trips,14,31
710,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,worked in our 2014 toyota highlander to keep our boxer in the back and separate from the kids she only tried to get over once when we stopped but was not able to get over all the way great price and good value for what we needed it for,48,32
711,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,difficult to install not all of the items described in the instructions are actually on the unit that said once it is installed it is the only device i have found that keeps my 80 lb dog off my lap while i am driving,44,33
712,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,easy to install after a while we did not need it anymore,11,34
713,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,yes my dog can jump over the top no i do not let him but for the price this can save a never ending car struggle if you are working to train you dog to stay in the back seat,40,35
714,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,excellent mother is so glad keeping her dog in the backseat,11,36
715,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,the only way to secure it up higher in an suv or any car is to remove the headrest to get the barrier to secure the straps do not have a buckle to remove and snap in to head rest my head rests are not designed to be removed therefore the barrier can not sit high up my dogs are still jumping over the barrier and sitting up front very disapointed,69,37
716,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,even tho it says it is for our car the dogs who are small medium size goes right over the top of it does not work at all,24,38
717,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,do not waste your money it is flimsy and loose not to mention bulky all the straps and buckles are a pain as well,22,39
718,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i always have my dogs with me in the car and am very pleased with this barrier it is super easy to install unlike other barriers i have used in the past and because of it is fabric design it is silent I have had the more elaborate barrier that had bars but that one tended to always come loose and then would rub on the seat or jiggle noisily none of my dogs have jumped over the barrier and they seem content with the see-through design at the top so they can look out the front window i do have a golden retriever german shepherd and a springer spaniel the barrier may not deter a dog that is determined to ride shotgun however we also foster dogs and i bring the fosters along to the dog park the two foster dogs that we have had since i purchased the kurgo did not attempt to jump over it either,157,40
719,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we really love this pet barrier we have had several others in the past and this is by far the best the last one was metal and looked like a cage or the back of a police car it was hard to install and take out and would not stay in place we just returned from a trip from florida to virginia and back and the kurgo worked perfectly it is easy to install and fits up against the seat so you do not loss any floor space as we did with several other barriers the price is less then any other we have bought and is really worth the it the kurgo arrived even earlier then we were expecting overall you will love it and you we highly recommend it,131,41
720,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,while it does the trick it is a little too high it blocks my vision a bit when i am backing up well made however and worth it,28,42
721,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,I am sure it would have been fine if it were complete i did not even get a receipt invoice in the box very surprising had to go out and purchase a bar barrier at the last minute,35,43
722,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we definitely need this pet barrier our dogs jump back and forth all the time this seemed to help but only 3 days after installation one of the dogs tunneled through and broke a strap straps need to be stronger otherwise it is a good investment,46,44
723,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,works well however very difficult to install the directions are not very clear it should install in a few minutes however because of the lack of direction it takes awhile,30,45
724,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this does not work in our suv it does not stay up in the postion needed to keep our big dog in the back it does keep groceries from rolling forward,31,46
725,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,if you have 1/2 a brain you can install without directions contains up to 3 dogs in the car at least that is how many are in this family good quality does the job as detailed very satisfied,37,47
726,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this pet barrier will make my dog safer as we travel it was easy to install and is very sturdy,20,48
727,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,buyer beware the pictures shown are not what you get you do get a kurgo backseat barrier but it is the one on their website i have yet to install it so i do not know if it works for me yet,41,49
728,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i bought this because it said it could seprate the back seat well it does not i went to kurgo actual site and they do not claim to have a model like that complete waste of my time installing and money i reccomend doing more research before purchaseing this,48,50
729,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we needed something to contain our new 1yr 8mo old 67 lb rescue puppy i searched the web to find something reasonably priced that would fit in our lincoln navigator our car has the 7 seat option and we often use them all i found it easy to install and high enough to keep our big boy in the back we also ordered the solvit 62316 waterproof suv cargo liner could not be happier with prime shipping,75,51
730,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we have a golden retriever / aussie shepherd mix she is just about ocd about going back and forth from the front to the back seats when driving our murano suvs the kurgo has been installed pretty easily and does a good job of keeping her in the back while the car is in motion if i park and leave her in the car in appropriate weather she will get to the front seat by squeezing between the doorpost and the front drivers seat no problem the only thing i wish was different is that there was more of the see-through mesh instead of the black nylon canvas blocking hers and our view between the seats,114,52
731,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the barrier gets the job done for our 9 month old golden retriever it keeps her in the back seat and much less of a distraction while driving both traveling and local driving has become much more enjoyable for all of us we can still see her and give her a pat now and then she loves to ride with her chin resting on the top of the barrier however according to my husband it is not very easy to install and remove and takes some time so ours remains in my car all the time which I am not very excited about,102,53
732,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,my dog jumped right over the top we have a very active shelty did not use till we went on a trip too late to return,25,54
733,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,let me add my voice to those who say that these things are worthless it took my three month old puppy less time to run over this barrier than it took me to install it what a ripoff,38,55
734,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i first tried this product on our pickup however the seats were too high and the barrier did not stop our dog for a second then i installed it in our suv and it is working well it is a little confusing to install but taking the directionsbyworked ok and it took me about 45 minutes all in all i think it is a good product and does help keep the dog in the back seat,79,56
735,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,i had a hard time getting this to stay in place my dog jumped right over it it may have worked better on a vehicle with larger seats,28,57
736,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike,19,58
737,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,subaru forrester with sunroof when the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down they like to take turns leaning on the center console and would slide forward when stopping she sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the giant and he tries to escape to the front not good nor safe the metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof they would hit the glass of sunroof those seem to be semi-permanent whether that is because take up to much room to store or to hard to install and remove i do not know all do not buy decision makers for me when i discovered kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs it does easy to install and remove even folds and slides back into storage bag easily dogs were happy they could still look over headrests and we are all riding safer we are happy and have already recommended to someone in the parking lot,162,59
738,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this product is not only difficult to install it also does not work my lab jumped over it with no problem it just makes it harder to get him back in the back seat,33,60
739,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,we take our terrier everywhere in our grand cherokee when we leave him in the car to job or eat he hops in the front seat he is a major shedder and likes to leave imprints on the car windows with his nose this device was difficult to attach it took a number of tries to find a way to fasten the lower parts biggest problem however was the ease with which our dog found ways to go through the barrier when we left him in the car it worked well to prevent him from climbing onto the center console while we were driving,104,61
740,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i received the backseat pet barrier and could not figure out how to install it finally figured it out and it works pretty good on the expensive side but nice product,31,62
741,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this pet barrier works great for our dogs they do not even try to come through it fit perfect in my dodge calliber our dogs are not small one is 110 lbs and the other is 80 lbs i think for the price it works great,45,63
742,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i put this behind the front seats in my xtended cab pickup truck my standard poodle just climbed right over it since then the material is tearing where the metal stays are poking through might work for a small dog but not mine,43,64
743,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the kurgo backseat pet barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound very enthusiastic portuguese water dog out of the front seat this was critical to me because my car a saab has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as i was driving a rather unnerving experience as soon as she saw the barrier my dog did not even try to wiggle through it sent a clear message and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet the barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat while simultaneously barring access to the front seat one caveat the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror so I am planning to remove it it unfastens easily this product is a great value and will probably last a very long time owing to it is sturdy construction and strong materials I have owned it for about a month and could not be happier,182,65
744,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my girlfriend was able to install it in no time and it works great although her dog does not like it,20,66
745,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i have a 100 lb lab mix who likes to play co-pilot while i drive and cuddle he likes standing between my seats which is dangerous for me and him and we have bumped heads too many times so I have been shopping for a barrier i have a 4 door sedan and therefore i can not install one of those big metal barriers which are very unattractive my only complaint is the installation it was a pain and difficult to understand and I am not sure if it is installed correctly instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat other then that it is not as tall as i had expected / hoped my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive but at least he has contained to the back seat,145,67
1012,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,we have a dog that always wants to chew on the bottom of the bed post we tried several different things but were forced shut the dog out of the room until we found this product it works great and has given the dog full run of the house again,50,0
1013,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,most effective product i have found i used it on an outdoor tree that one of my dogs was found of eating i have both a large lab and a small aust cattle dog both were curious at first but neither were found of the smell and left the tree alone product is also effective at repelling humans i gaged nearly each time i applied it i did not try the product indoors thus i do not know what lingering influence it would have on people largest downside i see is the need to reapply occasionally i reapplied to my outdoor plants once every 10 days,107,1
1014,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,cleared my sinuses right out taste and smell does tend to linger seems to deter my cat pretty well suggest using in well-ventilated environment,24,2
1015,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,the reviews are right this does not really work my puppies did not like the taste however they still licked on it they would just shake their heads after they lick it then lick on it again i would not buy it again,40,3
1016,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,i used this for my puppy that was teething and biting everything that was in sight i used this spray and saw results immediately she had stopped chewing furniture rugs plants shoes even my other dog ha very harsh smell but be careful you can actually taste it which is very bitter soapy taste to it blargh otherwise it worked well for my pooch,64,4
1017,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,we have got a young lab that will chew on anything and was pulling up / chewing up our neighbors solar yard and walkway lights i sprayed this all over the new ones i bought to replace the damaged ones the dog left them alone for about 3 weeks then i found one back at our place but not chewed up i sprayed it reset it and resprayed all of the other ones again this does seem to work,77,5
1018,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,awesome stuff it stopped my puppy from chewing on the molding around the floor knawing off our paint and huge chips of wood our wooden chairs and anything else we did not want her destroying i also recommend telling them no that is not your toy and then giving them one of they are toys that they are allowed to chew on and say chew on your toy to help redirect that behavior it is natural for dogs and especially teething puppies to want to chew on things and they need to have something they can chew on but this spray really helps to let them know what they can not touch it is really powerful stuff definitely hold your breath when spraying it a mask would probably be better because if you breathe it in while it is airborne it will linger in your mouth and it tastes horrible,142,6
1019,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,not only did it not deter my puppy he actually likes to lick it this was no help to me,20,7
1020,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,spraying this on things actually attracted our dog she was obsessed with licking it in fact even more than before sigh,21,8
1021,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,when i sprayed it i tasted the bitter in the air i think it had more I shall affect on me than it did my pet it did not deter the chewing i used it unsparingly and repeatedly to no avail,40,9
1022,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,it was a waste of money for my puppy he seemed to like the taste it would actually attract him wherever i sprayed it,24,10
1023,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,this was ineffective in preventing my dog from chewing things i ended up buying cinnamon oil food grade which finally did the trick,23,11
1024,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,alright so i tried this on two of my pets a shih tzu and a miniature pig i mainly bought it for the pig as there was a spot of carpet she had been picking at lately and i wanted to discourage it before it became a problem well this stuff arrived and i figured i should test how good it is or rather how bad it tastes both pets generally take anything from my hand that i offer and then spit it out if they do not like it so for my test i tried a plain old scrap of paper sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu he ate it and then asked for more then did this with the pig as well same result they both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was i going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff i repeated the process once more to be sure i then put some on my finger and they both licked it clean needless to say i decided not to spray it on my carpet since both of my pets seemed to love the taste,201,12
1025,Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,2.0,negative,it does not work as well as other products my dog does not seem to mind the taste when you spray it on things the fine mist goes in the air and you breathe it in and you can taste it it is horrible it also has an awful smell to it,49,13
1026,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,these are perfect for my little girl and she uses them on cold days they stay on unlike many others we have tried,23,0
1027,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,once your dog gets used to these boots they are very helpful to the pup like the double strap still slips but does not get cold,25,1
1028,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,i bought these for my pooch he has an eleven pound shihtzu the extra small boots were loose around his paws and he was very uncomfortable wearing them he has rubbber boots that fit more snuggly and has no problem wearing those the velcro strap also does not do much and they came off just wearing them in the house the only good thing was i was able to return them for a full refund with no questions,76,2
1029,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,my dogs front paws are larger than the other two i specifically measured and bought the right size size seems just a bit bigger so the straps can not be tightened enough it started to flap out during the walk and i was shocked to see the he got a bleeding blister from his old wounds it would have been better it fit and stayed on in one place but it goest flap flap flap i may need to come up with anto some how tighten it you may want to buy a smaller size because of above price is too steep for me to just try and throw away was looking forward to it hmm 2 stars,119,3
1030,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,much better than other boots I have bought stay on and durable,11,4
1031,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my four legged friend has dirt free paws after wearing this,11,5
1032,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,it took a while to figure out how to get them to stay on but once i did they have my 19 year old shih tzu even occasionally run on the slippery wood floors,34,6
1033,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they stayed on my pups feet for a few blocks and then they slipped right off my dog is about 10 lbs,22,7
1034,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,can not get my dog to wear them he keeps trying to shake off his feet i have a chihuahua and he has picky about every thing,25,8
1035,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these seem to be made well but the sizes are really big for being extra small did not fit on the dog very well so i have not really used them much,30,9
1036,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,simply did not stay on the paws of my pug not sure if it is a breed-specific problem but were useless to me also do not look very durable,26,10
1037,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,just as described but my miniature long haired dashaund was able to shake them off in a few seconds no matter how i put them on might work better on a less hairy breed or a dog more tolerant of things on them he likes clothes but was not digging the shoes,53,11
1038,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,velcro ties do not adjust and fit properly on my dogs paws i thought these were water proof but did not meet up with my expectations a bit disappointed constantly have to check to make sure boots are on dogs paws while walking in the snow occasionally slipping off paws,51,12
1039,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these fall off of my dogs feet no matter how tight i get them,14,13
1040,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,dog was able to undo and remove instantly,8,14
1041,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,they do not stay on when it snows or on rough terrain no matter how tight i make them,18,15
1042,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,the boots are not waterproof and do not stay on purchased them for our 18 pound pug they are a little large the problem we have is they will not stay on because the velcro is stiff and is not elastic at all our other dog boots from fashion pet are the same except they have elastic with the velcro at the ends and they stay on the elastic does not hold up although the other problem with ultra paws is they have a large foam pad stitched on the inside back of the boot which serves no purpose and actually made the boot not stay on at all removed the pad with a seam ripper and we now have a 30 chance of returning with them on,126,16
1043,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,well made but my beagle would not wear them,9,17
1044,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the quality seemed good but they were too big and i had to send them back it is hard to know how to order them online,25,18
1045,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,keep my dogs feet so warm love them,8,19
1046,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,easy to put on and my dog does not object to them,11,20
1047,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,completely failed to stay on and have turned into an occasional chew toy,13,21
1048,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,quick delivery delayed a little bit by a massive blizzard boots are good although we may have benefitted from a size smaller because they do fall off if they are not on tightly very easy to out in and take off which is huge when you have a squirmy dog who constantly wants to go out,55,22
1049,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i got x small my 10 shihtzu fits great in them velcro closure makes it easy to put on and tighten up his paws are a little lost in the boot we need them for the cold temps so he can withstand the snow while going out to do his business,52,23
1050,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,got these for my 25ish pound miniature schnauzer who loves snow but is having issues with snow andballs forming between her toes when i take her snow shoeing these work better than i thought they would if you take the time to make sure they are on tight they stay on very well it was pretty funny watching her try them on for the first time have your phone ready to make the video once she hit the snow however she got it and off she went just like a puppy again,94,24
1051,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,although the sizing was a bit off slightly large despite closely following the instructions and measuring twice these dog boots were exactly as described unfortunately the dog was less than impressed with them was afraid he would do more damage to his hips trying to get rid of them than simply walking without them it was worth a shot and I had bet the effectiveness heavily depends upon the dogs personality not docking the review for that just one star off because of the sizing issue,83,25
1052,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,unfortunately I have had an extremely hard time keeping these on my pups feet they fall off within a few minutes of a walk,23,26
1053,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,1.0,negative,does not fit my dog and a full refund does not cover shipping cost,12,27
1054,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they looked nice but even small or xsmall was to big from my dog so i returned them before my dog would have broken a leg,26,28
1055,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,reasonable product but the x-small were huge on my 75 lb chi-weenie,12,29
1056,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,these boots were way bigger than advertised it seems like someone could actually design boots to work on dogs but nothing I have seen is designed well the only upshot was is that my dogs spent more time trying to get them off which distracting them from digging more holes in the yard but it only took five minutes for them to get them off,64,30
1057,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the boots are really nicer than expected however my dog hates them and tries to pull them off,18,31
1058,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,the price was great and the shipping really quick i do recommend this seller for that reason the booties work most of the time on our elderly dachshund keeps him from slipping on our hardwood floors however they do tend to slip off because they are not formed to fit a dogs leg outside they tend to slide around until the tread is on the top i think these would work much better and stay on longer if there they were shaped to fit the bend of a dogs leg where the ankle is i think i might bend them and put a stitch there to give them a boot shape instead of mitten shape they really do help although and it is so funny watching them get used to walking in them,132,32
1059,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,the xs were way too big for 4 lb yorkie they looked like ridiculous hotpads on her paws she could not walk in them the bootie hotpads fell off immediately come in a package of 4,34,33
1060,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,they do not stay on during short walk,8,34

1069,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i bought these for my puggle pug beagle mix she is very hot / cold sensitive and this winter we have been having has really taken a toll on her when we go out to do her business she literally shivers and holds her paws up off the ground we live in the midwest and it has not been above 20 here for over 30 days now after getting used to these going outside is not as painful for her now she can scamper all around without having to lift her paws while she stands the only complaint i have is the measuring system these were an x-small and i measured as the instructions said to but they are still quite large on her so just be sure to note that they do run a little bit bigger than what you would expect the xx small would have fit better but these will certainly do other than that no complaints with the product,157,43
1070,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,these boots are durable warm keep her feet dry and most importantly stay on her feet definitely a must have,20,44
1071,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,2.0,negative,i followed the sizing guidelines and believe it or not my 70 pound german shepherd required x small boots they are the correct width and they fit snugly over her paws but they are far too short and they do not go up past her wrist so they frequently slip off the top material is easily penetrated by her claws and they are coming apart after just a few days,69,45
1072,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,we live in minnesota and have many sub-zero days when it was impossible for our bichon to stay outside more than 30 seconds with these boots she does not mind the cold at all they allow us to go for walks even on the coldest days she was cooperative about using them right from the start and i can get all four on in 30 seconds just make sure you pull the fastener really tightly and they will not come off,79,46
1073,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my yorkie likes them at the begining she had a little problem walking but now she is used to them and they are good for the cold weather keeps her paws dry and warm,34,47
1074,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,we hit 40f yesterday and even although our shih tzu is not crazy about wearing them ultra paws save his feet but i do not like wearing mittens either on most walks 1 block round trip or less he usually throws one or two off so i have to keep my eyes on the road but the ultra paws have made it possible to take those winter walks and pee on all his favorite snow banks one nice touch i noticed was a pad sewn into the inside on the upper part where the velcro wraps around the leg it makes it a bit more comfortable for him when i wrap those velcros around his ankle one of the straps was split and i had to use another strip of velcro in order to use the boot,136,48
1075,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i tried several brands and they would come off when my dog was in a full run these stay on in long distances the tred could be a little thicker and they make the paws sweat but other than that they are golden,43,49
1076,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,my buddy could not stand on the tile or hard wood floors his legs would just spread out these gave him immediate traction they were a miracle i tried socks which were fine but kept falling off these stayed put until i took them off to walk him outside,49,50

1079,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,4.0,positive,i have a toy french poodle four years old and his name is chunky roberto around twelve pounds usually in winter he was getting his paws and fur wet and i decided to give this product a try is a plus to make sure about the size triple check i got the xs and worked perfect make sure you tight enough so when your pet run the will not come off still working with chunky to put it on he does not like it and i understand is not his nature but once outside he walks and run as nothing first time shoes for my dog it was not bad good for after rain and snow not very wet paws,121,53
1080,Pet_Supplies,B001F6XPLY,5.0,positive,i have a 13 lb cavalier king charles-poodle mix i ordered the x-small boots her paws measured 1 1/2 the boots looked a little bulky when i first saw them but once i got them on and tightened both straps they seemed to fit well having 2 straps to secure them makes a huge difference there is also foam on the front and the back to help secure the boot around the leg as others have mentioned these are not great for snow more than a couple inches deep i let my dog run through the snow which is about 6 deep and she did get some snow on her legs right above the boots however the boots were tight enough to prevent snow getting inside leaving her paws completely dry we will definitely be using this when we go on walks in the winter,144,54
1081,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
1082,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,these work great holding not only the hose end of my high-powered dryer for the corgis but can also support the weight of a hand-held dryer for our papillon the clamps are very stiff and if you have any problems with lack of hand strength this product will be a challenge to use,53,1
1083,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,the clamp is strong i need 2 hands to clamp it down the black little plastic covers at the clamp tips slide off easy i suppose one could glue them back into place with some glue-epoxy just have not gone through the trouble of doing that yet for at home use it works fine anything fancier and you are in the professional grooming business i suppose like an extendable flex arm which rotates on / from your ceiling around the dog d have not used it but a few times,86,2
1084,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,I have used thisonce and so far I am loving it my american cocker puppy squirms a bit when she has on the grooming table after getting her bath the groomers third arm allows me to keep both hands on her while still being able to dry her off cuts my time in half very sturdy well made product,58,3
1085,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does my only minor complaints might be that for a woman the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality you should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps will not completely protect theof the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table i would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on overall a good quality product,110,4
1086,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
1087,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i actually returned this grooming arm it was not strong enough to hold the hose,14,6
1088,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open clamp does not really work well too heavy,11,7
1089,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,love this for my hand held hair dryer much better than holding under my chin for fluff drying,18,8
1090,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,very sturdy but the plastic covers on the clamps are cheap thin and fall off easily when the clamps are opened i have secured mine with electrical tape,28,9
1091,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i work as a dog bather and do a lot of force drying some of my larger project dogs have been difficult to dry taking about a half hour with a reducer cone and two motors going it was a lot of hair i bought this to stretch dry some of my hairier clients to really fluff them up for a groom the first day i attached it to my table it got used on a matted doodle and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat the doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker so did that golden it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile if you are thinking of buying a stretch dryer or a big stand dryer try this first i was ready to spend 200 on a stand dryer when this 40 tool fixed all my problems,177,10
1092,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works great my only complaint is i can not take the hose off the clamp and put it back by myself,20,11
1093,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
1094,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this product does what it says it will do free up one hand so you can dry and brush the dog at the same time my only concern was that it was very hard to squeeze the clamp to attach it to the table,45,13
1095,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,exactly what it says it is very pleased,8,14
1096,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,exactly what i needed to help me dry my old english sheepdogs i tried to fashion one of these for myself and it was an epic fail this one works perfectly,31,15
1097,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
1098,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works perfect now i can keep both my has on my dogs / cats,12,17
1099,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i use this to hold a shower head to wash my dogs in the sink in the laundry room it gets rusty after 6 month because of the splash of water so i just bought a new one photo attached,40,18
1100,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,wanted to like it i could not squeeze the handles when i was able too clamp it on it would pop off,22,19
1101,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is ok it holds the dryer hose well but the extension is not long enough to clap onto theof a table and dry pets from the top down which is important when grooming yorkies cresties and shihtzus this is not a must havebut it serves it is purpose well,50,20
1102,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this thing was in my cart for a very long time i thought it was too pricey for what it was and was looking for cheaper things to use i ended up buying a cell phone clamp which worked great for my metro quick-draw force dryer but when i bought the big-daddy metro force dryer it would not hold the heavier hose i finally bit the bullet and bought it and it makes my home grooming so much easier it is very study but forgiving when moving it i usually take the nozzle off my hose and turn it all the way down so i can use it as a fluff dryer love the size too mine came all black which i like better than the orange,126,21
1103,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,clamps are too hard to open mine broke off where the clamp piece meets the flex pipe after only a year,21,22
1104,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,works protective rubber tips come off and tear very easily,10,23
1105,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it does not fit the hose with an attachment on it and the clamps are so stiff i can barely get it on the end of the hose without the attachment,30,24
1106,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,very difficult to position and to squeeze the grips do not use on plastic,15,25
1107,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,strong grip bend to where you want it holds in place,11,26
1108,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,is there a softer version of this very handy tool i can not even press the clips open enough to clip onto my grooming table and yes i do open my own pickle jars the clip on the other end is also so strong that i fear it will crush the hard plastic at the end of my dryer hose i would recommend this product only to the incredible hulk,69,27
1109,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this did not hold up my nozzle to my dryer at all,13,28
1110,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,my wife wanted a hands-free hairdryer holder and this fit the bill perfectly i mounted this to a cabinet door in the toilet area next to my wifes sink it is been hanging there for a few months and has not fallen yet despite a few head bumps on my part,49,29
1111,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps take super strength to open i could not do it donated to goodwill,15,30
1112,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm did not attach tightly to the table moved around and the arm was so stiff it took two hans to adjust,23,31
1113,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,this is a very bad design i am going to return mine,12,32
1114,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,need strength in your hands to work these clips but once attached great,15,33
1115,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,excellent sturdy and able to hold the weight of a hand drier also only problem is needing to have strong hands to open and shut the clamp but then if it were not tight it would let slip the thing it is holding would not it,43,34
1116,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open much too strong a grip i do not bother using it at all because it is so difficult to use and i am not a weakling,29,35
1117,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this is great frees up both hands for combing / brushing,9,36
1118,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,received as advertised works great great packaging fully recommended seller,10,37
1119,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this thing is poor quality for the price the reviewer that said replace the rubber tips withtape was spot on as soon as i tried to use the clamp the rubber tips slide off and cracked junk the arm itself is weak the weight of my dryer makes it drop down so i had to mount it high and place dryer on the bottom so gravity would help position instead of fight it i paid 32 at 15 it would have been worth the price at 32 it is not a good deal,95,38
1120,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,too hard to to bend or open the clamps men probably can do it but i could not,17,39
1121,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the clamps do not want to stay clamped to anything and if you do get it to stay put as soon as you move the arm the clamp let us go,29,40
1122,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,it is very nice and really helps to dry the coat of show dogs there is one small issue however it takes awhile to loosen the clamps and until that happens it is really difficult for me to open the clamps wide enough to use but then I had rather have it this way than the reverse such that the clamps open easily upon first purchase and then become too loose after use all and all a good buy,76,41
1123,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamp on the bottom of the table does not hold tight you may turn the flexible arm upside down and use the other end of the clamp and it will do the same it is not tight enough for when you move the dryer hose around there has constant fixing and adjusting something that you do not you should not be doing when a dog in on the table,66,42
1124,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the rubber clips always slip off the arm can not hold up the weight of a human hairdryer clamps are very stiff,21,43
1125,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is great for what it is suppose to do but the clamps are really hard to open and after being clamped on the table for a while it left a mark but it is worth it if slight damage to your table is not a big issue also my table has a vinyl coat on the top so it is easy to damage it with something like this the coil part is easy to maneuver and the clamps swivel making it pretty simple to get it right where you want it,90,44
1126,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
1127,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i do love this product and it is very helpful but i do not use it as often as i thought i would still it does the job,26,46
1128,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,grooming my 3 yorkies takes time this dryer surely cuts that time in half only drawback is the really hard spring in the clip almost have to use two hands to get it open enough to clamp on the table other than that it is a great deal,47,47
1129,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,not flexible am unable to aim the dryer end where i need it to be the grip is too tight I am afraid it will break my dryer hose end,29,48
1130,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i actually used this arm to mount a video baby monitor near the crib to get the best vantage point without hanging over the crib itself this arm worked very well each clamp is strong and stays in place i was even able to temporarily unscrew one clamp to cover the arm with a baby mobile arm cover to match the room decor the arm itself positions well and is stiff enough to stay where you set it just what i needed,82,49
1131,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm is so stiff it is impossible to move it around to dry different areas of the dog if you just want one to stay in one spot it is great if you want to dry the whole dog it is a huge disappointment,44,50
1132,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,it does a great job i do not have a problem with it at allit is easy to mount and i can angle it just where i need it my hands are free to do the dogs thanks so much,40,51
1133,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,saved me a fortune as i use my blow dryer with this instead of the expensive forced air dryer and since i have show quality persians and exotic shorthairs to groom daily i am totally satisfied fits perfect on any and all my grooming tables or counter tops,48,52
1134,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is too hard to open and grab the blower it can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently but not to travel as i needed,30,53
1135,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
1136,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies other than really is working,24,55
1137,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a simple product and it does what it says it does my biggest complaints is that for a me the clamps are very hard to squeeze open anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps the other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time i used them overall a very good quality product the product has been great for me,78,56
1138,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,thisworked as discribed and was a life saver in my work with the dogs i have to groom it is everything it claims to be in it is advertisement and a definite must for all groomers who have more then 4 pets a day to wash and groom,48,57
1139,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,i bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs it does not really work and i have not been able to sucessfully use it yet and I have had it for about 2 months it will not stay in place the clamps just slide around on the counter maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that was not smooth the clamps are really hard to get open so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job on the bright side i can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose,100,58
1140,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the basicof this grooming arm is good but what you will not realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate the clips are extremely difficult to open in fact they are impossible for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands it was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room unused,83,59
1141,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,does what it is supposed to do but expect the black plastic endcaps to come off the first time you use it i intend to use some epoxy to glue them on permanently this is the only issue that kept me from giving the device a 5-star rating,46,60
1142,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i mean who could not use a third arm when trying to dry a dog this product is perfect for freeing up your hands and your concentration when drying your pet it is well-made with heavy bolts and clamps it is flexible yet it stays in the position you set it to get your work done each grip comes with holes on both sides which allow you to bolt this product to your grooming table you will want to do that otherwise you will not enjoy it is full benefit meaning you will have to use two hands to reset the grip if you need to adjust it during a drying session nuts screws and washers for securing it to your work station are not included in the packaging it would be nice although if they were,131,61
1143,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
1144,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
1145,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i used this with a blow dryer on my grooming table to finish the head and face of my dogs i was afraid it might not support the weight of the dryer but it is not even an issue no matter where i position it or twist it it holds it wherever i place it i did not have the money for a conventional stand dryer but i think I shall be just find as long as i have the third arm,80,64
1146,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i purchased third arm mainly so that i can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat totally what it is intended and designed to do for me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top i needed to use two arms than i clamped the blow dryer to the top arm but than when i had a wet cat ready to blow dry i could not move the third arm i tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off eventually i was able to screw it back on after i blew dry my cat without third arm but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod hitting on impact me my cat and the mirror in front really useless if you use metro dryer the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod it is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder i could do without,190,65
1147,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,the ramp does not lie flat on the back seat of my toyota corolla when my lab walks up it the ramp buckles and my dog slips off he could get hurt using it wish i could find a way to make the space larger or return it as is it is just taking up space in my storage she had the ramp has scratches on it from when my dogs nails tried to avoid falling off the uneven surface he slipped off it and could have gotten injured it does not fit on the back seat of a corolla,99,0
1148,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,this is a sturdy half ramp and stays in place it is used on mywith the doggie door my senior sheltie feels secure and has no problem walking on it i also bought a solvit telescope pet ramp forstairs it too has worked out well very pleased,51,1
1149,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,i recently found out my darling terrier olivia has arthritis she can no longer jump up into the car or our bed i bought two ramps one to keep in the car and the other for the bedroom she weighs 30 pounds and it is difficult for me to lift her so this product is invaluable for both of us it was so easy for her to figure it out i praise her each time she uses it and she seems to enjoy her new adventure the only recommendation i have is it would be helpful to have a handle to grab on to when attaching it to theof the car with the leash in hand one has to manipulate the ramp with only the other which is awkward,130,2
1150,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,i bought this to help my dog get on the bed and he uses it every night each morning iit up against the wall and go to work so he does not get on the bed while I am not home he can jump off the bed just fine now i control when he can get on things and when he can not it is scratchy on the surface like sandpaper but he could care less he hardly waits for me to get it in place at night so he can walk up it to get on the bed it is very light and i can move it easily from one place to the other it also looks nice so i do not have to hide it in a closet so people will not see it worth the money,136,3

1152,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,this ramp did not do it for us it would not stay securely on the door ledge and even if it did it was way too steep it is also very bulky the surface is sandpaperish which i suspect did not feel too good on the dogs feet,48,5
1153,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,our 15 year old cat loves to scamper up this ramp to reach his food bowl in our kitchen we put nonslip feet on it so we could increase the ramps height and incline and decrease how far it sticks out in the room smaller footprint unlike the ads picture of the ramp ours does not have a wavy surface,60,6
1154,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,i injured my back and am unable to lift my 18 dog at this time i needed to find a solution to this problem since he is not a jumper i searched for a ramp that would work in my back seat i have a 4 dr sedan of my mid-size car not a van or suv this solvit half ramp is a littler narrower than most and it works for me at a slight angle he is able to go up the ramp to the back seat by himself the majority of the these ramps were made for vehicles other than sedan cars fortunately the width works for me the ramp is well designed well constructed and extremely light at 7 s the light weight design enables me to place the ramp in the front seat area so i can use it again for unloading for me the car storage works better than the trunk because of my back he is able to get out of the car reasonably well very pleased with my purchase,174,7

1162,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,there ramps are great i have two others inside and outsdie had them for years they work great for my little dog who had both leg surgeries,27,15
1163,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,I am sure the product is ok but we did not even get to use it before our dog died i was not happy that amazon would not take it back even although it is still in it is original box unopened because it was past the time limit,45,16

1170,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,the ramp is too steep for the back of my suv when i went to send it back to the seller is would cost me 20 at the post office or 33 atnot worth it i will just have to keep it since i only paid 44 for it,51,23

1173,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,would not recommend because it does not hold stable to anything you have to brace it with your foot to keep it from moving while you use it depending on what you are trying to do that is not very convenient,38,26
1174,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,its just perfect for going to the dog park,9,27
1175,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,although the ramp description says it can be used on a couch / sofa there is no way to attach to the couch or cushions so it kept falling off this defeated the purpose which was a safe avenue for my dog to get on the couch very disappointinghas been returned,52,28
1176,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,it is too wide for our kia soul car doors just do not open wide enough,15,29
1177,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,no i thought it would be sufficient to ramp from floor to bed too steep for my little yorkie he will not use it instead I am using it to block access to different areas,33,30
1178,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,this is great ramp because it is one-piece and lightweight i use it to help a senior yellow lab get in and out of my car this ramp is a bit shorter than other dog ramps so perspective buyers need to keep in mind the degree of incline in situations where it will be used,55,31
1179,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,returned it it would work for theshown in the picture but that is about it,16,32
1180,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,i have two mastiffs with knee problems whenever i buy dog products i look for reviews from owners of massive sized breeds this ramp is wide enough and just long enough to make the 12 inchup into my mini-van easy for them it is also wide steady and heavy enough 7lbs not to be wobbly or to bounce,59,33
1181,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,did not work for the sofa inside too steep but is ideal for saving the backs of my basset corgi and mini dachshund when coming from the patio through the doggie door,32,34

1183,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,i do love this ramp it was easy to install and my 16yr old dog can use it with ease rather than climbing steps,24,36
1184,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,i returned thisdid not work at all for my dog i do not see how it would work for any large dog,23,37
1185,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,the ramp came quickly and it is very sturdy i have a subaru outback and it barely fits in the passenger door i have to anchor it with my foot at the bottom so it stays put so my dog can climb into the back seat i probably will try to put something along the bottom so it will not slide it would be great for a van where the door slides open instead of just opening,76,38
1186,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,this ramp did not secure very well to my stairs therefore it was not safe for my pets to use the width of the ramp was good which was what attracted me in the first place but i had to return it because it did not fit well,46,39

1189,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,i bought this ramp because i needed something for my dog that was not too bulky or heavy for me to use the material on the ramp is very slippery and my dog scratched it up and fell the first time he tried to get in the car then it had scared him so he would not try it again my dog is medium sized 50 lb maybe it would work for small dogs i would not recommend this ramp i ordered a ramp with removable carpet from my local pet store and it works great,96,42
1190,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,this is not well designed and clumsy i would not recommend thisto anyone with a sedan as it is too wide to fit in a back seat door opening,30,43
1191,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,thiswas too large / wide for the door opening for my suv probably works best for vans or sliding doors,20,44
1192,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1.0,negative,not a regular door so it is useless not a normal car with the width of a normal car door no way,22,45
1193,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,a little cumbersome to haul around for a small dog would be great for a large dog and a van,20,46
1194,Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,my daughter owns a vw jetta the back seat door does not open wide enough for the ramp to fit,20,47

1198,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2.0,negative,smells terrible guess no company makes good flea and tick repellant for what i pay it should also repel flies the other one i used was just as bad,29,2

1202,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5.0,positive,i love this stuff i first purchased this product at tractor supply because it was on sale i used to live in an apartment complex so my two dogs would play with about 10 other dogs daily it was a dog oriented community and we loved it of course they got a lot of fleas within the first few days bad enough to where there were fleas in the house and in my bed so i had to try something i did not want to pay the outrageous 40 for the good stuff so i figured I had give this a shot i have one dog who is about 15 lbs and another who is about 35 - 40 lbs so i got this to use with both of them it was amazing within a day if not hours all the fleas were gone from my pets my house my bed thank god and the product actually smells pretty good an orangish citrus smell my dogs do not like when it is applied but i think that is because they do not like the squeezing noise when you apply it overall great product it is the only thing i will ever buy in the future plus it is a great price,201,6
1203,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,seems to work on my 13 pound weiner dog it does appear to take a few days before it kicks in but overall i think it is effective and not too pricey when it is on sale the smell lingers but eventually it goes away no issues with dog being lethargic or having any allergic reaction overall good product,57,7
1204,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,i put this product on my clean dogs bathed the day before 5 days ago and have yet to see any marked difference the poor things are still scratching,29,8
1205,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,did nothing to control fleas on our sheltie if you have a similar long hair breed you might do better trying a different product,24,9
1206,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,this product did not work on either of my two dogs i was very disappointed that it did not provide protection against fleas and ticks as advertised,26,10
1207,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4.0,positive,i read before buying sentry pro that many of these topical flea medications can have alarming side effects i did not use quite as much as recommended rather gave my dog a really good flea bath and made sure she was dry before applying the product i have not seen a single flea since and the dog had fleas pretty bad i think it is important to mention i took several days to clean the house from top to bottom with borax and bleach and put a cheap flea collar in the vacuum cleaner bag in the days immediately after recognizing i had a flea problem i wonder reading the negative comments if fleas infest the house if any product can be effective likely some people find it easier to use the more expensive brand and if i had the extras money perhaps i would have also but i am satisfied as the product did what it promised,157,11
1208,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5.0,positive,i use this product as a preventative measure and because the price is unmatched my dog has had no fleas and she spends a large amount of time outside i will continue to buy this product,38,12
1209,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,1.0,negative,i used this thinking it would prevent fleas but it did not work at all local pet store person told me that only advantage or frontline are really formulated to take care of fleas,33,13
1210,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2.0,negative,I have used this twice on 2 different dogs it works ok on one but does nothing for the other i will not buy this brand again,26,14
1211,Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,2.0,negative,bought this product because i like the sentry dog shampoo it smells good and has been one of my favs lately because of the flea season even although i use flea control on my dogs on a monthly basis it still happens in my place i bought this product and the flea trap planning to kill all both on the dogs and in the house none of the products still fleas on the dogs probably it is time to move on to the expensive brands,84,15
1212,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I have used the software for years and highly recommend it to our customers for the price it is untouchable it is easy to use installs quickly and does a great job of teaching the language in question i can not understand why anyone would actually pay ten times as much for one of the other brands that at best is marginally better and at worst is largely the same richard bangs co-founder mountain travel sobek host and producer for the pbs series adventures with purpose,82,0
1213,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i was the senior buyer for the whole language and education software category at best buy for 5 years in that time the instant immersion brand consistently outsold all competitors we never got any complaints product returns and it was far and away the best selling product in our language assortment in my opinion it is a really great product it sounds to me like the other reviewers above have either a not actually used the software or b have ulterior motives and are associated with one of the instant immersion competitors that sells for ten times the cost we assorted numerous other language titles but none of them had the sell through needed to stay in our assortment,118,1
1214,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,there is no way you could learn any useful spanish from this cd it is not worth it i would not pay a dime for this horrible product do not waste your money,31,2
1215,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,if you want to learn straight vocabulary then this is your product however if you wish to learn how to speak spanish then do not waste your time or money it does not teach you how to construct sentences it basically teaches you random vocabulary and in the later lessons uses huge sentences in which you will only be able to pick up on the random vocabulary words to guess what they are talking about in short this will leave you in the dark on the bright side i now know how to say kangaroo in spanish,93,3
1216,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i have been trying to learn spanish for years most of the products were simply too boring for me to stick with it this product has a ton of content for the money there are 6 different software programs on 6 discs the only complaint i have is that you need to swap discs for each level good and bad in addition to the software there is an audio cd as well as a dvd that you can play on a dvd player and an extra game i have not figured out the game yet but it is an adventure game that you need to navigate in spanish there is no manual so it is not easy to figure out the software programs have gameshows trivia and many photos of items that you need to identify in spanish overall i give this product 5 stars because of the value you simply get a lot for the money,156,4
1217,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this product leaves you to educate yourself the first cd level 1 disk 1 has a word list an easy game a more difficult game and some other material there is no suggestion as to how you are to use these materials or proceed through the lessons it is a stretch to call them lessons since that suggests some degree of organization i give this product one star because you can not post a rating of zero,78,5
1218,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this product leaves you to educate yourself the first cd level 1 disk 1 has a word list an easy game a more difficult game and some other material there is no suggestion as to how you are to use these materials or proceed through the lessons it is a stretch to call them lessons since that suggests some degree of organization i give this product one star because you can not post a rating of zero,78,6
1219,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i recieved this and it is a grate learning tool it is easy to follow and easy to use to learn with thanks,23,7
1220,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this would not even be worth a dollar you will not be able to learn spanish with this invest in rosetta stone instead do not waste your money with this cheap knock off what you will learn might be a few simple vocabulary words and some terms or sentences but you can learn those for free from free programs or apps or even from dora the explorer on tv you would learn more from exposure to telemundo than you will from this do not buy it,83,8
1221,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,seems like the program itself is ok but i was looking for something to use while commuting the cds are not compatible,22,9
1222,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,great price point easy to use kid friendly reviewed by teachers and it was recommended used by all ages jr high hs and adult,24,10
1223,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i like the fact that i can sit in my living room with earbuds in my ears in the middle of a group doing their own thing and learn repeating over and over spanish i like how vocab is in a male voice and then a female voice switching with each click i get to hear the pitch differences which have been so helpful i am happy that info is delivered incrementally and you can go anywhere you want basic to difficult and back again you can even wear it while you sleep and learn it subliminally if you like or learn it in your car using the mp3 disc it is very versatile,114,11
1224,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,works great arrived quickly and my wife is well on her way to speaking spanish much cheaper than rosetta stone,20,12
1225,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,great quick and easy way to learn spanish on the fly does not concentrate on the reading of a language,20,13
1226,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,maybe it is me and I am just not capable of learning a foreign language as an adult funny i did not have this hard a time with high school german i just can not seem to learn from these spanish software programs this is the third I have tried for me i have had the best luck with repetitive audio programs i can listen to in the car or while running in my ipod maybe it is just that as an adult i do not have the time to sit and do a program and get nothing else done,96,14
1227,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this set has been around a long time and always a great way to supplement other spanish language courses worth the investment,22,15
1228,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,my seventh grade homeschooled daughter has been using this product to learn spanish it is easy enough to set up that she was able to do it all on her own we would purchased rosetta stone at a much higher price but she likes this one better,46,16
1229,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my husband and i bought it for our niece in law and she has not said not one negative word about the software to us we guess she loves it,29,17
1230,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i brought this product to help in college but it was a waist of time because it only teach you the basic for example 1 to 20 this product does not help you at all the software looks cheap and the games are boring and pointless do not buy unless you just want to know random greetings and numbers,58,18
1231,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this system is helpful for both beginners and advanced students it is as good as other systems that cost you much more i think that spanish should be learned by any who wish to succeed in business in the coming years and this system gives you a good start,49,19
1232,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i purchased instant immersion instead of rosetta stone which way more expensive i started to like it until i found out that there is no written material no book no pdf nothing most would agree 99 of any class I have taken had / required a book this one does not but it needs one I am sending my instant immersion back,57,20
1233,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i took spanish in high school and college so i know and understand what some may consider to be a lot but i am far from fluent i would say i can talk with a child and even then i am not fluent this program did not help me in my goal to become fluent it did help me increase my vocabulary but as far as becoming a spanish speaker this program did not help i also found some errors with the translations an example is the english speaker said i am from a town and on the screen it said i am from a town called madrid like i said i know some spanish but this program has not helped me to become fluent when i read the reviews it was as good as rosetta stone but the tech support was not there i find this not to be true i have gotten the test demo from then and thought it to be more helpful,166,21
1234,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,thank you for sending it on time but the box was destroyed when it arrived because whoever packed it wrapped it in a paper grocery bag really maybe next time put your merchandise in something a little sturdier so when it arrives to your client we do not get damaged goods just a thought i have not been able to start learning spanish because for some reason the disks will not play in my computer or dvd player even although the box clearly states that it is compatible so I am not thrilled but it did arrive on time beat up as it was,101,22
1235,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,it is kind of a fun program my boys 3 and 5 love computer games and to them this is something of a game the vocabulary lessons are presented in a manner of here are some words now you repeat them now you answer which is which that seems to work pretty well i have not yet gotten to any grammar lessons yet so i can not say anything there at this time one factor that i really like is that the program has two spanish speakers so that you can hear two different tones of voice and accents pronouncing the words we will keep using this and i hope to come back and update this review when i have gotten to the grammar lessons,123,23
1236,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,wasted 600 dollar rosetta stone does not work level 1 works but once the words became anything longer than 6 letters it is basically useless and only frustrates you my mom is from spain and is completely fluent and the voice recognition kept on saying she was not saying it right and later she had one of her spanish friends try it and it did the same do not waste you money if you do i will sell you mine,74,24
1237,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i bought this product for my daughter who is struggling in spanish in college after one week she understood and spoke spanish better than she had after two years in high school her test grades improved and her conversation grade improved the teacher noted her improvement instant immersion spanish 12 and 3,52,25
1238,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,we purchased this product to give us a basic introduction to spanish right off the bat none of the disks would work with a mac i tried three different macs and encountered the same frustration the disks simply will not mount i can not review the effectiveness of the language lessons because we could only open the workbook do not waste your time we will be retuning this product to the store / manufaturer,71,26
1239,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you do not need to spend hundreds of dollars on the other people who spend so much on advertising their product this one is the real deal easy to use ipod / iphone friendly my husband is already speaking a lot of spanish after a month it is truly incredible he is ready for his trips to several spanish speaking countries,58,27
1240,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this program is definitely a good investment to learn basic spanish or just brush up it costs far less than comparable programs like rosetta stone i wish there was more vocabulary in it but i have learned a lot and am able to make and understand basic conversation my favorite part is that i can put it on my ipod and take it with me wherever i go,68,28
1241,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i do not see someone learning the language there is very little actual instruction it provides very limited practice and relies heavily on oral input without accompanying written word brief lessons are followed by a game approach basic guessing results in high scores not worth the money I shall try rosetta stone instead,51,29
1242,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,I have tried several times to give this set a fair shake but i just do not like it it feels sort of like a cut-budget rosetta stone software i do not feel as although I am learning anything the lessons are disjointed and sometimes confusing and there seem to be way more discs than there should be a language program like this can not be taking up that much memory all in all if i needed to really learn spanish I had go looking elsewhere for an effective product,84,30
1243,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,my children and i are using this to learn spanish we love to compete with each other on the quizzes on the dvd we have not been able to use the computer discs although because our cd drive broke but we are learning a lot from the dvd however the girls accent is thick and a little hard to understand at times but since they put the words on the screen you can figure out how to say it,79,31
1244,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,have not yet begun in earnest looks very adaquate for what i was looking for the games make it less onerous,21,32
1245,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this is a slow and tedious way to learn a language and i am running on win7 with an i7 processor and 8 gigs of memory so it is the program not my machine it slowly reads a lot of short old tired videos from the cd the product appears to be a recycled jumble of mostly old language disks two are more modern and move at a reasonable pace some disks require installing programs such as flash and quick time i do not like programs that use because flash contains spy-ware tracking that you have to go to the adobe website to disable some disks seem to repeat the material on others but in a different format if i had demoed instant immersion first i never would have bought it,130,33
1246,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,you get out what you put in this system let us you learn words and phrases then match them to pictures and audio with games it would be great for a child to use i had found it necessary to communicate with spanish people who refuse to learn our language i had put it off long enough and now use the system for relaxation after a long day at work this is the first type of system i have used and for the price you simply can not beat it do not waste your money on a more expensive system before trying this one,101,34
1247,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i can not stress enough how absolutely terrible this software is it freezes my computer within 15 minutes of putting it in a help box constantly comes up saying that there is a timing error the quality is bare minimum do not waste you are money on it,45,35
1248,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,save your money just save it and spend on rosetta stone if you really want to learn spanish thanks this is tourist stuff too simple,25,36
1249,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,I have used rosetta stone and I have used this immersion program and this one just can not compare it is repetitive to the point of annoying the graphics are awful and it does not have the intuitive learning progression the rosetta programs have definitely a poor choice,45,37
1250,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,I am very pleased I am getting better with my spanish all the time it seems much easier then any other program I have tried,22,38
1251,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,first time user of this product gives a good introduction to the language plus it s fun for the price would recommend to anyone,22,39
1252,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i have use rosetta stone and i think this is very similar definitely try it the price is better than most other programs,23,40
1253,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,thank you it was everything you said it was I am glad i decided to purchase this such great service thank you again will purchase from this site again,28,41
1254,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my son purchased this program he is an emt and wanted to learn spanish to help his patients he said he loves the program you can not beat the price it repeats words back to you so you get the correct pronunciation my son-in-law is spanish speaking and bought the spanish to english program his english noticeably improved when he started using the program it is like anything else you have to keep doing it i would definitely recommend this product,79,42
1255,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i was pleased when god led me to this product i had wanted to purchase the rosetta stone software but found it too expensive then god showed me this software in a catalogue although i have only used disk one of this program i can say that it is a fun way to learn a language the pictures make learning the the vocabulary easier i took spanish while i was in school now more than ten years later I am using this as mostly a review i like instant immersion and would recommend it because it is fun and you can not lose at 3500,102,43
1256,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this is a great product it is very user friendly and lots of fun i think it is well worth the cost i have recommended this product to my friends and co-workers,31,44
1257,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,disc is damaged has loud humming noise that is very distracting while trying to learn shipping and packaging was however quick and efficient,22,45
1258,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i got this program so i could keep my fluency at about the same level over summer break i was really hoping for a basic program that would simply teach you spanish and allow you to listen to spanish conversations and try to interpret them but this product is clearly aimed at elementary school children it is laden with a heavy graphical interface i would not get this program if you were serious about learning spanish i just could not use it because it is so ridiculous it does not even make sense it might just be better to get rosetta stone but rs costs like 500 dollars you pay for what you get i guess it also never really immerses you in spanish even if you were to ignore the interface it is still a very poor learning experience maybe if you want you child to try and learn spanish this program would be good but from my experience nothing works better than traditional classes and actual conversations with spanish peoples,169,46
1259,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,upon starting the software learning regimen i found it easy to navigate and fun to learn for all the negativity written about this software I had have to say those people are out of there minds what you learn is spain spanish for what you get compared to the price it is a no brainer for those of us who did not learn rudimentary spanish in school this is a great product i come from a spanish background never learning the language i did not have the discipline to learn until now you really need to converse with other spanish speaking people to get it to sink in practice makes perfect i am already thinking in spanish overall I had say it is worth the investment where else can you learn so much for so little wonderful product that is highly recommended,137,47
1260,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i bought immersion spanish a few weeks ago and when i uploaded the first cd to my computer it was just that-instant it has a male spanish speaker and a female spanish speaker who pronounced the words each in different ways to give a clear understanding of how to pronunce the words it has a clock like list of lessons firstwords food colors phrases countries shopping time numbers and body on cd 1 you click on the topic you want to practice after you practice you can click on a word practice session or an easy or hard game session it has a speaking practice where you can speak and listen to how you pronounce the words it also has a dictionary you can print when I am done with level 1 i will progress to levels 2 and 3 of the other cds i think it is easy and to the point great,154,48
1261,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i found instant immersion to be ok i mean it is no rosetta stone but of course rosetta stone costs hundreds of dollars so this is a great value for what you get i find that it is probably most helpful as a supplement for a beginning spanish class if it is been a couple of years since your last class and your basic spanish is rusty like me or if you just want to learn a few conversational phrases for a trip or to be able to communicate on a very basic level way more interesting than just having a book or a cassette i would hardly call it immersion however unless they sent several spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program which they do not by the way it is nice that it works on both pc and mac i do not see that a lot with software especially when it is fairly inexpensive,153,49
1262,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i started with disc 1 which reviewed vocabulary i really enjoyed playing the easy and advanced games at the end of the program however i had major problems with disc 2 after returning the product to the store and getting the same program i thought it was my computer i opened disc 2 on another computer although i could open the program i had trouble exiting the program and saving my scores disc 2 contains vocabulary to memorize but without the easy and advanced games at the end i found disc 2 to be very boring although disc 1 was fun and easy to use i do not recommend buying this product,113,50
1263,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,there are a whole bunch of comparisons between this product and rosetta stone already but I shall throw my two cents in I have got both and found this product cheap in every sense of that word rosetta stone was definitely the better product of the two and was more what I had call immersion instant immersion is not immersion it is mostly memorization more so than rosetta stone this is not a product you could really learn the language from I had say it is best use is for a student in a low level spanish class to get a little more practice also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp for instance azul becomes athththul or azcar becomes ah-ffffu-cah overall this product works okay as practice if you are taking or have taken some other spanish class you almost certainly will not learn spanish from it at least alone then again it would be hard to learn it solely from rosetta stone so at least this is cheaper,173,51
1264,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,in this audio you can hear the lady swallow breath and even hear the spit in her mouth it is disgusting on all levels I am surprised they could not delete these sounds when doing the final edititing all i can hear is her taking deep breaths and swallowing very thick spit either the lady is dehydrated or is diabetic ew,60,52
1265,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,i picked this product as a less expensive alternative to the allegedly more robust language software offered by rosetta stone since i had studied spanish years ago i thought this package might help me restore my former skill with the vocabulary which always seemed to be my weak point admittedly i failed to remember that since this is a cd-rom it runs from the dvd and i was not expecting the program to run as slowly as it did but my bigger problem was the interface the lack of instructions even rudimentary ones and the blurred accents of the native voices that i was supposed to mimic it is possible that this product might be appealing to small children since it uses cartoonish characters for me after several hours of frustration i decided i would have to try another approach,138,53
1266,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,my daughter chose the rosetta stone-more bells and whistles but instant immersion spanish is plenty for me as i try to learn spanish i am glad i bought it enjoy the ipod program while on my daily walks and look forward to pursuing at my own pace on my computer without feeling intimated in a class room setting and much cheaper too i also have been very pleased each time i use amazoncom-i checked other sites and this was best price and service,82,54
1267,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,i got this to help me pass my spanish college class i love it ],15,55
1268,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,disclaimer i am reviewing a copy i received for free through the vine program this is a good program and is worth the selling price i think you can read the other reviews comparing it to rosetta stones and other vendors spanish language programs this is a little cheaper but still does quite well at least in the limited time we have spent with it we have not gotten too far along yet,73,56
1269,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i have used rosetta stone and this product i agree that neither are quite what they promise which is an easy way to learn a language for someone to compare this favorably to rs is highly suspicious to me after multiple failed attempts to get this product to work on my mac i went to a pc laptop to actually check it out this product compares to rosetta stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak this is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list perhaps that is worth the money but do not confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from rosetta stone my problem with rs is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary so in that sense this would be a nice complement to rs the audio cds included in this are actual lessons thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing it is really not comparable to rs at all and any comparison is incredibly unfair they should take those claims off of their packaging I shall be demanding a refund for the mac incompatibility but otherwise would make use of the money back guarantee save yourself the hassle,199,57
1270,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i like it but it seems more like a game than a real teaching tool the cd roms do not break down the language like i would have liked them to they teach you the names for colors or objects but do not put it into a sentence for you and I have learned that spanish speaking is backwards so that does not really help speak the language the cd for the ipod is wonderful although it really breaks down why the language is the way it is that 1 cd is worth the price of the whole hope this helped,97,58
1271,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i bought it because i need some basic spanish for a trip i found it useful to have different methods of learning audio ipod sentences common phrases matching games guessing games and a video i think i got enough of what i need to travel to mexico i was comfortable enough to understand the key words from what people were saying i did use the tech support site and found my answer in their onlinei even asked a question and got an email response in about 3 hours that contained useful stuff but also had links to the exact answer pdf document for my needs i am glad i did not spend the money on more expensive products that would sit on the shelf when the trip was done,132,59
1272,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,this progress takes a lot of time to work through but it is very helpful to develop conversational skills it covers travel questions and answers shopping and day to day activities it builds one lesson to the next which is also helpful if you follow through the program you can learn converstaional spanish a person will not get fluent in a this language with this program but it is helpful if you are unable to enroll in college courses it also is good to use between breaks if you are taking a college course it funtions well on the computer and i had no software issues with this program,108,60
1273,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,takes a bit for slower computers to kick up the cd-rom drive I had suggest loading this on you hd if possible seems ok on computer with faster processor and cd-rom / dvd drive the first disks take a little fishing around with unlabeled tabs but this could be intentional to get your mind into another space fun and easy to useincludes flash card type games lots of repetition of vocabulary and as much on pronunciation as you would like covers general travel conversation including medical emergencies and business a great start for starting to learn a new language can not beat the price would suggest for students who are considering or will be taking spanish in high school and/or college it is good to familiarize yourself with the language sentence structure and more before jumping in and this is at your own pace is not mexican spanish but castillian spanish good to use if you are going to take a trip as the basics are very helpful even if shopping great way to start learning spanish and you will find there is much cross-over to mexican spanish italian potugese and more on your own if you go onto learn more languages,193,61
1274,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,well worth the money disc includes many spanish words and phrases and let us you listen as well as see the words in print it allows you to take quizes and receive a score you can record the words in your own voice after listening to the words on the disc you will have to have a headset to do this,60,62
1275,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i do not think there has much i can add to the other reviewers here there has lots of vocab but not a lot of grammar the option to listen to vocab lists on an mp3 player is nice and convenient and let us me review while driving the flash cards are good reinforcement I am not finished with the whole set yet but even when i get there I am certainly not going to be fluent that is impossible but i think this would be a great companion to a spanish class i do not think there is enough grammar to be a stand-alone course although I had like to see more grammar lessons bottom line if you are trying to learn spanish go ahead and give this a try at this cost you do not have much to lose,127,63
1276,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i purchased rosetta stone spanish level 1 and completed it i was ready to purchase level 2 but it cost so much i wanted to try spanish immersion immersion is much simpler and is not comparable to rosetta stone it is good for learning nouns but no way could you learn the language for example in rosetta stone you say a word or phrase and if your pronunciation is good enough it accepts it at first i thought i pronounced words good enough but rosetta stone made me keep saying them till i got it correct in immersion you pronounce a word it records it you play it back and rate your own pronunciation,114,64
1277,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i like this langauge learning system much better than other ones I have tried such as fluenz i have not tried rosetta stone too expensive likes colorful clickable graphics menu system excellent organization colors numbers foods phrases and more both male and female speech examples for all games are fun and easy to learn some games show how the word is spelled as well as spoken works with apple products including ipod and iphone professionally done dislikes there is one bad recording for hola on the dvd did not automatically run upon putting in the disk have windows vista had to manually begin install am i actually learning the language yes at least the basics overall this company is on the right track,120,65
1278,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i have wanted to learn spanish as a second language for years i have used tapes cds and software but i always found them boring and i did not stick with them what is different about instant immersion spanish is the fun you have while learning the language while the approach used in this software is similar to other more expensive programs it is less of an investment than if you bought one of the high priced programs and still comparable in quality for someone beginning to learn spanish instant immersion spanish is fun and effective it would rate this program a high value for the price,106,66
1279,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,without a knowledge of spanish i was able to skip all of the work to the end and get 90 - 100 on all the quizzes if answers are multiple choice then the correct choice is always much too obvious this makes it impossible to get good feedback on whether or not I am actually learning anything i found myself making flashcards of the material and doing it myself there is a satisfaction guarantee from the publisher on this product and i will be sending it back free spanish flashcard software and literature i found on the internet was much more productive,99,67
1280,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,you know if you think you want to learn a language but are not sure then instant immersion is a great place to start it does not cost a lot and it gives you in miniature what the big boys rosetta and tellmemore give you will not feel swamped likely and you will get a feel for what software language learning is like i sampled the spanish version and i am asssuming the other languages offered are similar remember too one learning source will not deliver fluency it is a long slog instant immersion is a good way to start,97,68
1281,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i bought this package thinking it was similar to rosetta stone i liked rosetta stone but do not believe it is comprehensive or rigorous enough to teach the basics of a language not worth the price it is a great introduction to pronunciation of simple everyday words it would be great for a junior high school student taking the language in school with a text but no way does it teach grammar it is a good supplement this software package was similar in that it did not teach any grammar and had no structured lessons in how to form sentences the only two disks i found useful were the first two which introduced many common words the rest of the disks were just haphazard phrases which might be good for intuitive learning but it was by no means in depth enough to learn the basics if you are a tourist trying to just get by for a few weeks this might be useful but if you really want to learn a language take a college course i would not mind if i had paid under 30 for this but i feel it is overpriced at 49,190,69
1282,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,this software is for the very beginners even the level 3 disc 2 does not fligh very highyou are not able to watch conversationnal videos like you do in other brands on the market in the same range of price i tried to play the cd oskar lake and could notit sounds very complicated i went to their website nothing helpful,61,70
1283,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,the title on the instant immersion box asks why does rosetta stone cost so much more it is because rosetta stone is so much better than the instant spanish immersion program i am a spanish and esl teacher i have used both programs rosetta stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face you will be fluent in any language after using rosetta stone however this instant spanish immersion program does not use immersion it teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other you can quickly progress through the cds without learning any grammar how can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences well after you waist 4000 on this product and try rosetta stone you will find out what i am talking about level 1 in rosetta stone will teach you more about the spanish language than a few cds in this cheep program why do i need 3 cds to teach me the numbers 1 through 20 that is rediculous not even my four year old is interested in the program [ ],193,71
1284,Software,1600775411,4.0,positive,i chose instant immersion spanish for introductory level spanish for my high school daughters they are in the process of working through it and enjoy it as a consumer the things you should know about this are the following it is easy to use there is not much guidance about how to use it but not much would be necessary since you are being immersed it is the same as if you were simply left in a spanish-speaking country and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the cds from level to level it does keep track of your progress as you learn thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at spanish for the price it is an excellent program to read a review of this curriculum and nine other spanish programs available this year see this site [ ] we use this product on an ibook but it can be run on windows as well,162,72
1285,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,this product is as good as the expensive and well-known brand why pay more,14,73
1286,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,dvd did not work or play what a bummer i guess i get what i paid for,17,74
1287,Software,1600775411,2.0,negative,very bad if your trying to learn how to speak spanish do not buy this,15,75
1288,Software,1600775411,5.0,positive,work as described great product for the price recommend,9,76
1289,Software,1600775411,1.0,negative,i got suckered there is nothing on the cds they are blank,12,77
1290,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,the dvd installed the map software on the computer with the usual intuitive mac interface the first time i ran map install it prompted me to download an updated version which i did this took 20 minutes i had the 2 gb micro sd card in the gps when selecting maps to upload the interface told me how many gb they would take up and how much room i would have remaining i selected washington and oregon and clicked install the upload to the gps took about an hour the maps look great and the device just works with them without any frustration or complication i tried using the map manager software and also found it intuitive to make and upload waypoints have no fear mac users,127,0
1291,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i first saw this map source described in the amazon description of the nuvi 265wt which i purchased the sample map display shown is what you see when using the pc software not what you see on the gps unit the cd contains cartographic data which the pc software is able to display that information does not seem to be transfered to the sd card or the gps is not capable of displaying it that was dissapointing but I am otherwise satisfied with the product i had a magellan meridian before which would only display elevation lines the garmin with topo produces a similar appearing display with perhaps more detail as to water features streams lakes and more when using the topo maps I have found that the 2-d formats provide a more readable display since the maps are essentially flat the elevation lines in the 3-d view are more distracting than meaningful,149,1
1292,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,after checking the many reviews on various websites i decided to go for it and am glad i did to those out there who are trying to decide whether to go with the micro sd or cd make it the cd the bonus base camp software is pretty nice even although i have not completely figured it out yet I am hiking a lot of trails I have previously hiked over the fourth of july weekend so I shall see how it all pans out compared to my green trails,86,2
1293,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,way too difficult figuring out how to use the product I have essentially abandoned the product and wrote it off as a failed experiment,23,3
1294,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this did not work well for thr rogue river trail in oregon not accurate andus down the wrong areas,20,4
1295,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,topography is fine do not expect much about trail information,9,5
1296,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,nice to have but using it slows down my garmin way too much so i hardly turn it on recommend getting the chip instead,24,6
1297,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,as promised simplesimple review good stuff,8,7
1298,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i this does notup comes with antiquated software that is maddening and takes hours dozens of hours to download then is followed three times before i finally gave up with a statement that there was a problem and gives inexplicable impossible to follow instructions i am going to try to talk with garmin but have little hope for it and undoubtedly try to return it to amazon by the way i asked my brother-in-law who is a cartographer and clever with computer software to try to make it work he could not,94,8
1299,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,when i read the product information provided i did not understand this required a very expensive gps for it to have any use at all in searching for a gps that would work with topo i found limited options mostly obsolete low ratings and extraordinarily high price tags it will probably never come off the shelf until we decide to trash it this was a regrettable purchase,66,9
1300,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,one of the few things i bought that i thought was a waste of money,15,10
1301,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this to anyone i bought it thinking it was up to date while loading it i see 2008 in several areas so despite the major hassle of downloading and transferring it I am most disgusted that it is 6 years outdated,43,11
1302,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i found some issues with basecamp loading this map but once it worked it is fantastic very happy with the dvds,21,12
1303,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it does everything you need it for it is kind of annoying that it can hold all of the usgs maps for the whole us on the device at one time especially with all the advancements in data storage on small micro sd cards in this day and age but if you can over look this and the obviously exorbitant cost for something you can basically get for free on your smartphone and this software is only good for what 4 or 5 states it is just quite disappointing to me i bought this a couple years ago for about 100 so hopefully in the last 2 years the price has come down and the storage capacity on the devices has gone up if not i would never she shall out more than 30 or 40 for this software it is just not worth it when you can get all this info for free on a stinking phone,154,13
1304,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,the garmin topo is out of date the trail locations inaccurate but it is the only game in town for topo maps better than nothing but not by much,29,14
1305,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,once downloaded i was extremely happy with this map especially compared to the default map that came with my garmin etrex 20 the only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it was difficult to download to my gps due to needing an update even before doing so it was brand new and already needed an update being a computer user not a computer guru made this process a lot more difficult and lengthy than i was prepared for and it was frustrating that said once downloaded the map itself is awesome and all I had hoped for however it would be nice if it covered more states considering the price,113,15
1306,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i was hiking in oregon a couple weeks ago and suddenly came to a trail detour the sign said closed for restoration so i followed that for a while but then wondered if i was going to miss a connecting trail to get back to the car so i took a gamble and went cross country to get back on the gps-shown trail i eventually found that i was on an abandoned trail that looked like it had not been used in years which eventually took me to the main trail still in use bottom line the maps got me where i wanted to be but the maps could be several years old and some trails me be wrong like this one there is no update service for this product so if you submit changes who knows how you find out if changes were made so I am happy with the maps but be careful things may not be correct,161,16
1307,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i have no complaints with the maps they are great they have all of the details one needs to complete an outdoor adventure however base camp is not user friendly making it difficult to learn how to get the maps on your device and i do not like the way that the maps are divided into sections i would like them to allow customers to pick the states they want and need and make their own bundle,76,17
1308,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,we use the topos for backpacking hiking mountain biking and offroading i finally upgraded after about 10 years i should of done it sooner we never get lost,28,18
1309,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this is pretty much a necessity if you want to do more than just follow roads with the gps or even if you do just want to follow the roads definitely buy the dvd although and you can share it with multiple units,43,19
1310,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i think how you can interface with google earth is cool the software they give you for maps is basic but putting all of your tracks and way points on google earth is sweet install on to my gps was easy and uncomplicated,43,20
1311,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,worthless i could have taken my family out to an expensive restaurant and gotten more satisfaction than this provided to me,21,21
1312,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,i got the topo maps set to use on my gemin vista hcx and the performance is very disappointing the contour line are dark brown over a yellow background the unpaved roads all show up as a dashed line and it is a far cry from the look you would expect from a topo map i spent almost two hours with their tech support to try and tweak the settings to no avail,73,22
1313,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,it took a while to download to my gps about 10 hours very detailed and i have not begun to explore all of it never tried the 100k so i can not compare,31,23
1314,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,i was able to route with this and the trail names actually help out alot i do not like how garmin makes you spend more money on a gps that you already spent way too much for,36,24
1315,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,as advertised items were shipped quickly and packed properly i would buy them again or would suggest to others their purchase,21,25
1316,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,all the detail i expected and more some of the roads are a bit dated as in they are not navigable anymore otherwise excellent in my clunky gps unit,28,26
1317,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,says on the packaging has township and range and section data but there is no way to get the section lines onto the map in base camp or on the device so it was less than useless for me there is no way to use this software to help locate section corners it simply will not do it,57,27
1318,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,just purchased this product and first time that i used it received message that the map was out of date and needed updating,23,28
1319,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,ideal map for the garmin gps once i was lost but now i am found although the map works very well with the device and is complete in detail if the device goe out you will need a paper map lest ye be lost again i have loaded the map onto the garmin 450 gps and into basecamp program and the two work very well together,66,29
1320,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i got the package and attempted to upthe maps to my rino 610 no maps showed up on the rino 610 i attempted 3 more times each time it took one hour to upload no maps were uploaded i went to utube and found out that you need to unlock the maps the code is on a little two inch by two inch yellow paper i could not find the yellow sheet with the code i went to garmin tech support no phone number on their web site so i filed out the form and got the email reply from them it stated 3 days to reply to my tech support request i was going to copy and paste the email but garmin does not what people to copy the emails there were no instructions or written statements about unlocking the maps in the packaging and no instructions or cd with the rino 610 i am returning both products i will never buy another garmin product again i love amazon however,173,30
1321,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,my dvd player does not work so I shall be using a friends pc to get the topo on my gps i must have read through the summery of this too quick or it was cut short because i would never order a dvd i just hope this conveniently scratchable disk does not require gigs just to make my gps work garmins nice n all but it has the market by the delicate bits it is sad i have no choice it did work perfectly after installation,83,31
1322,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,these maps are pretty good but because of the file size it was impossible to get all of the map data onto the memory card that goes into the gps i had to delete some of the areas that i did not think I had be travelling to in order to get the rest of the maps to fit on the memory card i know this is not a big deal but they should find a way to make the maps fit on a memory card and before you think well just a bigger memory card i was using the largest memory card supported by the gps unit which is the case with most gpss you are limited to the maximum memory card capacity as set by the manufacturer other than that like i said great maps with good detail,137,32
1323,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
1324,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,disappointed with the lack of trail info buy this only if all you need is topo info because their is very little to no trail maps at all,28,34
1325,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,expensive program but worth every penny when you are back country unfortunately their are not many options available for the garmin at the moment,24,35
1326,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,it was a good product just lacked in a couple of trails which was not too surprising seeing that they are snowshoe and xc ski trials in the winter and roads and mt bike trails in the summer,37,36
1327,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this is one of those products that you have to sit down and play with becuase the instructions are not great and transferring the maps over to a device is not very streight forward the other reviews about these issues were spot on,43,37
1328,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,I have used the mapsource 100k series since 2002 and purchased the 24k series when i purchased my new gpsmap 62s the 24k series is outstanding well worth the investment i do not know if this is a 24k mapsource feature or a gpsmap 62s feature but i wsa surprised to discover that i can plan a route to a street address by road i did not expect to be able to find a street address with with 24 topo map i wish i would have tried a street address before i installed the 24k series then I had know if it was the gpsmap 62s or the 24k mapsource that provided the capability the maps were great to have while hunting,118,38
1329,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,it can not be installed on other then c drive somewhat accurate but expect divergence with reality and 24k map so do not make you are life depend on it this piece is not updatable as is every map from garmin garmins software both mapsource and basecamp is quite low quality and usability it is slow and ugly if you care do not expect much support from garmin if you can use google map if you have to use garmin set you expectation to extremely low level i did but i am still annoyed i just do not understand how free google can be so-o-o much faster more accurate and convenient and why on the earth i should plan and verify my trips on google maps,124,39
1330,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,the very first track that i tried to mapped out i found is incomplete and incorrect therefore i can only imagine the accuracy of this topo is suspicious unfortunately garmin has a stranglehold not only on the navigation instrument but also with the proprietary software and of course the maps software that you have to own you can not use any other mapping software / product with the garmin gps for the 12995 plus tax shipping and handling i think i have a reasonable expectation the garmin topo would be accurate it is not my other complaint with the topo software is there are no instructions on use i guess the topo engineers expect new users to be intuitive or just learn by trial and error it is sad garmin can not provide easy to use instructions in plain english,136,40
1331,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i feel like i just got ripped off with this product it would be great if topo 24k worked but with no manual and email support that does not seem to go anywhere i have nothing I have been holding on the 800 support line for almost a hour and starting to feel ripped off this is just too expensive of a product to have no documentation 1st it does not want to install on any other drive then c so have a lot of space available just to install it 3 gigs 2nd once i enlarged the boot drive so that the software wouldi tried to use it again with no manual and no help there has little one can do with it unless your into a treasure hunt i think i got some maps on the oregon 450 t but I am not really sure to delete the files the program says find the file you want to delete then delete it what file what has the name of it where is it located oh i guess one just deletes files randomly until the correct one goes away which ever that file is,191,41
1332,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,auto routing yes universal single use mapping trails great except garmin chose brown elevation lines and brown city roads in parts of san francisco distinguishing streets from a high fill of elevation lines is not that feasible as far as preparing to write to a micro sd card a core 2 duo 6300 took 6 hours to prepare a single 8 min write quad core 9550 more than 4 hours more than twice the estimated displayed also firmware update for etrex and 60csx allowing a 4 gig card not quite enough capacity for ca na or wa 24k i made a special card part city navigator nt part topo 24k city navigator nt disables elevation lines when active california is two map files on nt from map hit menu select setup map check or uncheck nt map for your city needs topo 24k is a separate map file for a zillion usgs quad maps by the way even the older city navigator maps cover some roads in death vally that require experienced 4wd operators stripped butte valley road,178,42
1333,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i bought a gpsmap 60csx and the western us topo 24k maps to use for hikes in and around northern california i specifically bought the 24k map version because it has routable trails the problem is that the map is missing a lot of trails for example in mt tam steep ravine is not included around santa cruz all of the trails that make up the skyline to the sea trail are missing these are major heavily used trails and having incomplete trail information really limits the functionality of the maps and the gps unit for hikers i have heard that the 100k version includes all of these trails albeit with less contour information I am really pissed at garmin and will probably be returning these maps,126,43
1334,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,i diligently read all the reviews before purchasing and thought i could handle the technology the directions are not clear to me to be honest I have spent only about 30 minutes trying to figure it out but I am already frustrated it is apparent i will need extra help to transfer data from this to my garmin will add more to this post if / when i can actually use the maps,68,44
1335,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,this really has a lot more to it the the regular topo map from garmin on the regular garmin us topo maps i got everything from the rockie west on a 2 gb card with the 24k topo i had to use 4 gb card for just the 4 states and i had to leave off the bottom of california below la off to get it to fit i put it in a rino 530 the only down side is it take about two to three minutes longer to start up,89,45
1336,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,just got into the geo caching and thought that this would be a handy map for me since i live in ca and do a lot of traveling in the western states havnt had the opportunity to use it yet since i am new to using a gps but hope to use it in a few months,57,46
1337,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,i have put this into my garmin and it is a real treat on those rides where i am utterly lost i mountainbike and often wander from the regular trails exploring what may be an even greater challenge or a bunch more fun this program has allowed me to accurately find a safe and easy route and gets me home,60,47
1338,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,this was my first mapping software purchase so i was not really sure what to expect and ended up disppointed i purchased this as an upgrade to the map that came with my oregon 400 t i feel like the software is second rate I am also disappointed with the map itself some trails i thought for sure would be on there are missing and the trail lines are so faint they are hard to see anyway not worth the money,78,48
1339,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,great product easy to use but does not run on serial gps like the etrex trexlegend serial version,18,49
1340,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,I have purchased the 60csx i love the unit but have many complaints about the mapsource that came with my kit first off the pacific crest trail 2000 that runs from canada to mexico which is to hikers like interstate 5 is to commuters is only listed as trail this is unbelievable also in washington state near shelton there is a campground known as brown creek it shows this as being in the national park it is not it is in the national forest this is a big deal if you are a hunter it is illegal to hunt in the park but not in the forest i have found many areas where the olympic national park is listed inaccurately if there is a better mapping software compatible that is accurate i would love to know about it,137,50
1341,Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,i must say this is a major improvment over the 100k map i use this in a nuvi 650 and a etrex vista hcx do not expect trails and such because that is not in this topo however streets and navigation is on units like the nuvi even on the vista the contours are such that i can use them for bushwacking if necessary i compared this to the free one that a lot of people use and there is no comparision that one had no streets whatsoever in my area i would recommend it if you can afford the price i got an amazon discount with a coupon so in conclusion much better than the 100k great map for garmins if the price is ok for you,125,51
1342,Software,B001RYFYYK,5.0,positive,not sure what i can say about topo maps specifically other than you are going to need them if you spend any time in the back country whether you are hiking or backpacking or just bumming around in the woods the maps are clear and easy to read on my garmin hcx legend they are not cheap but what can you do sure you can look around online for free compatible download-able maps from online sources but i found i could not always get the coverage i needed from free maps simply put if you are going to be using your gpsr for anything outdoorsy on the ground in the western states of washington oregon california or nevada just suck it up and get these 24k topo maps not the 50k1 or 100k1 get the standard of the realm 24k1 topo maps then learn to actually read a topo map if you do not know how garmin provides two free to download guides for using a gpsr one specifically covers using your gpsr in conjunction with a paper topo map these are both good resources and are worth reading especially if you are unfamiliar with the wealth of information a good topo map provides get them here [ ],204,52
1343,Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,based on what I have seen so far garmin 24k topo falls very short i only base that on looking for two trails in the olympic mountains both trails are in gaia gps but neither are in the 24k very disappointed i just spent that much money for something that does not have two very popular trails i think garmin could have done much better,63,53
1344,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,it is almost unusable it took many tries to get past data errors before it would install,17,54
1345,Software,B001RYFYYK,1.0,negative,i ordered this back in march of 2015 but did not try to install it until i got a new computer that took awhile now i have tried to install it on two different computers and i keep getting an error code 2502 i down loaded base camp hoping this would solve the problem it did not i tried to install an update for net but that did not resolve it either 8900 bucks and i can not get the damned thing to work on my new windows 10 systems is there a fix,90,55
1346,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,in arizona around the big lake area in the white mountains i found several forest road numbers that are incorrect even in the city of tucson the map has alvernon way not crossing the rillito river there is a very nice bridge at the river all of these mistakes are in a small area but i know these places how can these maps be trusted in areas one does not know that is unless you do not mind being lost in the forest i contacted garmin and their response was to carry back-up navagational maps so i guess they do not trust their own maps buy national geographic state topos in my experience they have never been wrong,115,0
1347,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i purchased this for my garmin vista hcx and the two make an unbeatable combo i can be on a trail in the mountains and request a route home the route will state something like this go north to forest trail 122 4 miles turn right on forest trail 122 go to farm road co123 12 miles turn right on i25 43 miles arrive at home 123 miles 65 hours the miles listed are the trail miles and not straight line distance when i have passed a national forest sign that says jones park 17 miles and checked the distance on my gps it matches exactly the find feature is good as well want to know if there are any hot springs in your hiking area do a find on hot spring and the nearest one will be listed and you can plot a route to it as shown above overall a very good product that i highly recommend,160,1
1348,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,this product is not very user friendly and took us hours to figure out how to use,17,2
1349,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it for all intents and purposes useless it did not show topographic lines and was very difficult to find a particular place i returned it,25,3
1350,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,although these maps lack a lot of the detail of 24k topo maps they are easy toand use i use an oregon 600,25,4
1351,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,not very good coverage for arizona disappointed in the detail around quartzsite arizona,13,5
1352,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,a definiteup for my gps really helps in navigating in the back country however it is a bit pricey,21,6
1353,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,if you use your gps off road at all it is must have information it makes getting out and about safer and more entertaining your gps unit will need to have memory available for storage shop smart,36,7
1354,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the disc comes with no directions the basecamp program that comes with it is seriously out of date after spending hours w tech support we got everything figured out and i was able to do what i needed,37,8
1355,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,topo maps are missing a lot of information shame on you garmin people depend on the accuracy of the maps that you sell,23,9
1356,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this is the defacto standard map for the serious hiker backpacker mountain biker or off road enthusiest the mapsonto your pc hard drive to work with mapsource theya little slow on my machine when you zoom in or out but i attribute this to the small memory in my laptop,54,10
1357,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,ok i felt i had to post this review because of the other review i also had trouble getting it up and running the problem is not with the maps it is with the software that reads the maps i spent some time with garmin tech support free and very helpful the problem is these old discs have a much older version of basecamp on them to make this work you need to go to garmins website and get current basecamp also free install it before you install the maps one other thing the big difference between these and the garmin 100k topo is that these have routable trails and roads as well as lots more detail this is what you need for adventure planning,125,11
1358,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the maps have great detail they are easy to download to my gps or print out fairly easy to figure out by using the help button,25,12
1359,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,I am very disappointed with this expensive high resolution map i use my garmin 62stc for hiking but there are very few trails on here including the well established well maintained trails prior to this i used the neo treks app with my iphone which had many trails on very inexpensive maps the garmin gps outperforms the iphone but these maps are a big disappointment,65,13
1360,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,was very disappointed in the quality of the displays was expecting the map would look very much like a usgs map instead it seems like a kid with a pen sort of traced the contours more important the shading for open areas against timber is missing so parks and meadows can not be differentiated from forest,55,14
1361,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it will notinto the computer when i try tothe program it will not run even when i try to do it manually,25,15
1362,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,works great with my new garmin oregon 450 glad i ordered this against getting the 100k version which other reviewers have said is about useless I am happy with this,29,16
1363,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the instructions with dvd are minimal and do not work nowhere on the packaging or the dvd does it tell you how much memory is required and that you might need to add an sd card to increase storage capacity the manual for my device is minimal in content poorly written and indexed the online help people at garmin online support contact you once a day i am now on day three trying toa garmin map onto a garmin device,81,17
1364,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,hike and atv in the south west find this to be helpful make sure you downthe up dates,20,18
1365,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,very difficult toon my toshiba lap top then once i got it loaded i went on line to see what program supported the program non was showmen i tried adding it to a couple of programs none will support it feel like i invested money that i can not use,51,19
1366,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,great topo maps but lack trail and road detail below the level of paved roads the maps do not even have fire roads let alone established trails in regional parks the iphone with google maps provides better detail and is much simpler to use there are apps for smart phones that will record routes without having to mark way points besides maps on a smart phone are free and are undated automatically basically the garmin maps and gps off-road devices are dated and difficult to use i have spent many hours and hundreds of dollars on a garmin gps sd card and maps only find they make and interesting paper weight save your money and put it into a good smart phone,121,20
1367,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good maps not exactly a usgs topo but still good with the contours and on the ground identifiers the files are big being over 3 gb however you better have a big micro sd chip in your garmin or other gps,41,21
1368,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the 24k topographic map is functional and works fine the hiking trails indicated on the map are not at all accurate on the several hikes i done since purchasing none are correct the indicated path varies from the actual trails by sometimes more than half a mile not a good thing if you are in deep woods if you want accurate trails for hiking buy something else,67,22
1369,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,unable to make version work that was installed on memory card internal memory version works well although does not appear the same on gps as on pc,27,23
1370,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,this dvd does not open on my macintosh i do not know why or where to find out why there is no manual the garmin website is full of hundreds of products and no good information,35,24
1371,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i think the map is good far more accurate than the default map which comes installed on the gps unit in order to use it on my montana gps i had to copy the data to a memory card i truly dislike the micro sd card it is very small and hard to handle drop it on a backpacking trip and you will never find it,66,25
1372,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the first map i ever got for a trail gps garmin gpsmap 60csx segments are easily loaded to the gps from the pc on which the map is loaded i did not find the colors of the map as hard to make out as some reviewers have said the map does not have as many labelled features as I had like i was using it hiking in the escalante-grand staircase natl monument i found things on google earth for example that are not on the map but these are easily downloaded to the gps if one remembers to do it before leaving home i also found walking on an established trail that the gps tracked me about 100 feet off to the side of it was this a fault of the gps or the map i do not know room for improvement yes adequate to get you where you want to go certainly,148,26
1373,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good price it is a complete set very fast safe delivery have not used it for a couple of years,20,27
1374,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed to find that this was the old version of the product next time i will buy from a retailer so i view the product and make sure it the current version tjm,36,28
1375,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought a new garmin gps for hiking and thought i would order a download from garmin covering all the southwest i am new to the gps world and did not know that this did not include hiking trails so needless to say i wasted my money do not order this if you are wanting detailed hiking trails bob,59,29
1376,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,purchased these maps for a hike in the area of the holly cross wilderness in colorado the maps were quite good except that the trails were either missing or sometimes incorrect i used the maps in my e-trex 20 gps and i was pleased with many options that the gps provided the problem is that even the paper maps often have incorrect trails it is not clear to me whether this is garmins fault or usgs fault in any event even with incorrect trail and a gps you can easily see where your are going and whether the trail is leading into the direction you would like to go i used amazon credit card offer to purchase the maps so for me it was 40 which seems to be reasonable i am not sure i would be that content with the product had i spend in excess of 100 which is the cost of the maps on garmins web page,160,30
1377,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,purchased these topo-maps for off-road exploring in our jeep and loaded on a [ new ] garmin 2595 the 2595 has more than adequate memory capacity for both street and topo maps no chip required thou i have read many folks douse their topo-maps on a micro sd so far I am very pleased the maps accurately depict 90 of the secondary primitive and mining-roads as-well-as geographical features and sites in the area of az where we live have not so-far used them outside of a 150 - 200 square-miles of home-base but in our case for our purposes well worth the price,100,31
1378,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,have been using the maps in northern az getting ready for elk hunt works great in the thick timber great buy,20,32
1379,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
1380,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,these maps are decent although you can get free topo maps i found out that are pretty much as good the only issue i have yet to discover these maps should support the 3d view on the oregon 450 I shall know in about 6 weeks if that is accurate or not free maps do not have that support,59,34
1381,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,i have used garmins map for about a month and find it very useful while the national forest roads are not all numbered they are shown as are the major hiking trails through the superstition wilderness the maps are great for planning hikes knowing the length and elevaton change of any route considered it is also great to see where we have hiked and know what we are facing before we leave the maps work great on my legend hcx we will be getting additional maps for other areas that we spend time in,90,35
1382,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i found this map easily loaded on my computer and then i just downloaded a portion of the map the area i use on my garmin and it works great,28,36
1383,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this map works great for sure the cool thing is you canon as may cards as you would like for various gpss,24,37
1384,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,the maps work very well with my garmin nuvi showing me features that i am interested in to 4wheel on it goes very nicely with the other map programs i have i installed it and one phone call to garmin was all it took to correct one little mistake i made all i had to due was restart the program to make it work,64,38
1385,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,garmin mapsource topo us 24k is a definite improvement over it is 100k series but unfortunately is incompatible with gps 60cs it works great on my pc but on the gps 60cs the contour lines completely fill the screen obscuring the map i upgraded my garmin 60cs with the latest firmware update but the contour lines still obscure the map i am very unsatisfied with garmins topo series of maps,69,39
1386,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,these garmin maps are a total waste of time poor resolution and detail no poi labels not much to like go to above the timber at [ ] and get the real deal,32,40
1387,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought garmin topo southwest easy to install other than that the product is way over priced for what you get I have been using the old delorme topo 30 garmin just does not compare i hunt in southwest colorado roads are miss labeled or just are just not shown continental divide not shown major trails ie continental divide trail rainbow trail colorado trail not shown a lot of garbage that an outdoorsman does not need who needs to know where shopping centers or an atm are when hunting or as garmin puts it on the trail the reason for the purchase was to put a copy on my etrex legend hcx and i wanted to print maps from my pc well i tried printing a map to an hp laserjet printer and it printed the navteq logo over the map i tried to a second printer an hp inkjet same thing after an hour on hold with technical support the technician told me garmin is aware of the problem and i should do a print screen well the same thing printed i logged into my amazon account and sent it back,189,41
1388,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is safe to say that most gps units are not made to be as user friendly as possible and this software is no different however it is not that difficult to use and will help you get a lot more out of your gps having said that it is ridiculous that you have to pay so much to get these maps i got the southwest maps because that is where i live and do most of my hiking but I am taking a trip to backpack in montana soon and it just is not worth it to buy the separate map dvd for that trip if these things were cheaper i would have amazons price is much better than most others but still very high compared to maps for gps units from other manufacturers i guess it is cheaper than buying lots of paper maps but you have to do that anyway because you are crazy if you rely only on your gps when you are in a place where navigation is a serious concern,167,42
1389,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is a map the detail is good for me i did notice that some dirt roads were not accurate when compared with your tracks but that has not been a problem,31,43
1390,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,as with most garmin products this is an excellent map program much more details than the older programs it does take a while to install on your hard drive but who cares,32,44
1391,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,great product very fas shipping i would buy it again if necessary,12,45
1392,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i purchased this software to be able to research and print maps for backcountry exploration by jeep and hiking i routinely use usgs blm and other topo maps but i purchased this to be able to customize and print maps from anywhere in the southwest it is impossible to print maps because the software will put a huge navteq logo across the page when it prints garmin has no solutions this software is garbage and a total waste of money,80,46
1393,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,perfect for what i want very detailed and easy to use,11,47
1394,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,has good features hard to use need to watch youtube videos to help figure it out,16,48
1395,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,very disappointed the map has less detail than the 100k topo map that was pre-installed on my montana garmin should be ashamed,22,49
1396,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this is just what i have been looking for i am a ballroom dancer and have many songs on of old cds whose files do not come up on the computer leaving me with dozens of songs marked track 2 track 3 with no info i need to keep my files in order i just downloaded the free demo version on this program and i was blown away it took only seconds to identify organize and find cover art for some very obscure songs amazing no more mystery songs i am going to buy the full featured version immediately,98,0
1397,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this program is fantastic it will find the correct names and order things should be put in it will find your album art it does it all you can even see videos of your song from youtube the only small problem i have is a lot of music has very poor album art i end up having to search for the album art myself but it does give you album art most are in the 300x300 400x400 range I am pretty picky and want 500 so that when i click on the album art it is nice and big other than that it is a great product and i highly recommend it,108,1
1398,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,the other reviewer does not seem to like this product maybe it is his computer but I am also using a macbook running snow leopard and i love this software it takes about 2 - 3 seconds per song but that is exactly how long they say it should take this program fixed my 3000 song library really fast and there has only like 50 or so songs that do not have the correct album art but it is way better than before and worth the money if your still unsure about this program there is a trial you can get at their webstite that will clean 100 songs i recommend it,104,2
1399,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,i used it for two windows xp computers one one it worked fine with 2 gb ram and on the other it locked up several times 1 gb ram i suspect you might have issues if you do not have at least 2 gb overall i am very pleased with it i cleaned up a library of over 5000 songs with a high degree of accuracy although a handful of songs were overwritten with titles in foreign alphabets nothings perfect but i feel like i got a lot of value out of it,92,3
1400,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not purchase tuneup does not work do not waist your money not worth it company does not care no product support likely to be going out of business soon,30,4
1401,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this program works great does what it says it will do and is easy to use i would recommend it to anyone who wants to clean up their music library it does what itunes will not do,37,5
1402,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product delivers as advertised it does a good job of straightening out tags and filling in all the information to test it first i took 5 songs and changed the tags incorrectly tune-up corrected all of them successfully my only complaint is that it is a little slower than i would like but i have a 9000 song library this is definitely worth the 40 lifetime price,70,6
1403,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this product some time ago and wanted to come on here to warn others against buying this software not only does it incorrectly tag many songs it takes a tremendous time to do so and freezes constantly i have used the program on two different computers including a macbook pro and it has frozen on both it may do an acceptable job of identifying fairly well-known rock songs but good luck if your collection includes hip hop electronic or certain older songs even common rock such as the rolling stones steer clear of this product it will save you a lot of hassle,105,7
1404,Software,B00266PHBI,2.0,negative,this is like the smart phone apps shazam or soundhound for music you already have on your computer but is unlabeled potentially valuable time-saving tool but ultimately disappointing implementation I have used it intermittently for for two or three years every now and then i use it to label tracks i do not want to do manually for example when i rip mixed cds from friends and have more than a handful of unlabeled tracks too often it can not recognize a tune sometimes it tuneup just hangs working but not producing results matching album art to tunes was equally disappointing a lot of the album pics were completely wrong the time you spend correcting the mistakes makes this not worth the expense,119,8
1405,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,tune-up is a very disappointing product it failed to recognize duplicates as it claimed it would worse i had to pay an additional 2000 to tune-up after purchasing it from amazon in order to find unlimited duplicates in my music files which includes over 5000 songs the package as shipped limited de-dupping to 50 songs it located no more than 2 dozen duplicates itunes is still able to reveal over 50 remaining duplicates without tune-up the product claims to find all missing album art but my collection is still missing album art on several dozen albums although admittedly some are quite obscure numerous albums show the wrong cover including covers from other artists entirely tune-up was a total waste of money,119,9
1406,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i actually bought the software in a store and upon installation it promptly downloaded an update this update simply does not recognize my activation code that came with the store software but acts like a free trial version and cheerfully let us me know that i have run out of my free service so i go to the website convinced that this certainly must be a mistake but it is not the new service works as annual or lifetime service for additional fee that is it became a webservice instead of a standalone application but they forgot to notify vendors about this who still sell it as the latter and this makes it a plane rip off the software seems to be a greatbut even when it worked it appeared buggy freezy pathetic you can achieve more by doing everything manually than relying on this piece of s tware,149,10
1407,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,be careful of getting a lifetime membership with tune up because your activation code will only work once or twice i sold my old computer and got a new one and even tech support can not solve my issue of transferring the activation key to my new computer super lame it is as if they are at the mercy of their own slow / glitchy software,62,11
1408,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,the software works on my pc running windows 7 however you have to register and download version 199 and get a new activation code from tech support they are nice and very helpful amazon needs to sell the latest version so you do not have to go through all the hoops this software is not for beginners in my opinion it works but not as expected,66,12
1409,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not bother using this program it might work for you for a little while but eventually it will force you to update and one of these updates will break the program you will spend hours upon hours trying to get it to work again you might get lucky and figure it out after 4 - 5 hours of trying but more than likely you will just be unable to use the program for months and months possibly up to a year while you wait on the program to come out with a new update there has a reason it has so many negative reviews it is awesome when it works but it stays broken a good portion of the time I have never understood why they will not leave good enough alone,124,13
1410,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,this software no longer works with the latest version of itunes it is simply criminal that it is still being sold,21,14
1411,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this software for 3995 and within 2 weeks before i had the chance to use it they went out of business i cannotthe software at all crooks,33,15
1412,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,my itunes library was a mess this product tuned it up works awesome just as promised now my library is up to date with album artwork found or corrected i highly recommend this product,34,16
1413,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,while this software is awesome it is not perfect i can not imagine any that would be perfect tuneup actually shocked me i did not think that there was anything on the market that would work anywhere near as good as this I am impressed if you have any doubt at all download the lite version and test it out that is what i did before i purchased it i have not used the cover art yet but my main concern was missing info for songs and duplicates so clean and deduper are what i have used fyi you can find coupon codes online and get a good discount i have seen coupons so far up to 60 off,113,17
1414,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,tuneup does what I have bought it for it has been able to successfully arrange most of my songs and get the right album artwork and this is not limited to american songs alone I had recommend this to anyone anyday,39,18
1415,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,as a bestselling author of non-fiction investigative books i do not have time to keep my itunes library in any kind of order i took a chance on tune up expecting the worst 24 hours later i opened itunes and found it in astonishing order some album covers were still missing but i found only one error mozart by don giovani instead of don giovani by mozart and this was a minimalist version of tune up bravo sterling seagrave,78,19
1416,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,especially if you have a big messy library with lots of different sources like mine tuneup worked wonders making complete sense of my library and making the de-duplication task insanely easy highly recommended,33,20
1417,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product works very well it does a decent job of cleaning up song titles and other information i had a very large 17 gb itunes library and it is now 999 accurate the only tracks tuneup could not fix i was also unable to fix manually so i think that is pretty good my only complaint is that when it finds album titles and artwork the majority of the time it will offer up greatest hits or other compilation albums rather than the original album on which the track was released,91,21
1418,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,I have been using tuneup for a while now and i have to say i love it it does exactly what it is supposed to do it cleans the track info and album art additionally the concerts feature is great for me because i have a giant library and it is tough to keep track of who is in town and when tuneup is amazing for making your music library more presentable which is great for ios devices because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better they also just sent me a coupon code for friends and family for 40 off at their website for anyone interested in a deal the code is friends40 either way i highly recommend this product,121,22
1419,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,installation works well but keep in mind that unlike the 2009 map that it replaces the 2010 map can not all fit in the internal built in memory of my 260w you will need to decide what to install eg 49 lower states or eastern north americayou have about 5 options the only way around this is to put the rest of the map on an sd card,70,0
1420,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i prefer using the dvd for the update it was an easy process have had a problem with the download process before,22,1
1421,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,there is not a lot to say about map updates for a gps but upgrading my nuvi to the latest maps and points of interet pois was a painless experience i just put the dvd in my mac and then connected the gps to my computer the updates installed and I am set,52,2
1422,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i bought the one time 2011 maps for my garmin 260w gps on dvd and tried to install it after many crashes it finally installed on my gps or so it said when i turned the gps on it said i no longer had any maps rendering my gps into a doorstop i spent hours with garmin support even giving them control my computer so they couldthemselves they failed repeatedly and had me try loading from the temp file as a last resort of course this also failed and now i get to try to contact them again which can take forever just to find someone else there with another badto try of course they will not suggest replacing the dvd as they now have my money and i now have my doorstop i will never buy garmin again,143,3
1423,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i want to update my garmin nuvi 765 t this looked like what i needed after reading the reviews i wanted to make sure i had the most current update i chatted online with amazon and while very helpful they could not verify if this was for 2012 or not on further research i called garmin they gave me the part number for the onetime 2012 update it is 010 - 10989 - 54 and told me the box is blue white and gray the one amazon is selling ends in 03 so it is an earlier version 2009 not the 2012 so buyer beware i love amazoncom but make sure you are getting exactly what you want and do not just go for the deal buy this particularfrom garmin it is about 10 more plus shipping but you will get the most recent update available that is what i am doing,148,4
1424,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i hope if you buy this you wait for it to go on sale or lightning deal i picked it up for 35 bucks for my nuvi 760 for the people that complained that they needed to get an sd card they clearly should have done their homework before buying the upgrade do you expect just any tires to fit on your car just because you have a car seriously of course it is the manufactures problem that they do not have space i think you need about 780 mb of free space say 1 g to be safe to install the full north america map if you do not have an expansion slot you are really sol with this upgrade,115,5
1425,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i got this on the lightning round for 2999 for my older garmin c320i tried to install on my windows 7 pc but windows keep closing the program and it erased the operating system in the gps had to reinstall off of garmin website i then tried on my windows xp pc and it worked great took about a hour to update without any problems,62,6
1426,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,avoid at all costs I have been trying to do this for over 8 hours i am on third attempt locked up two different computers update-installed the disc in my computer waited the download out right before it finished the download it had an error message corrupted data if problem persists contact garmin customer service 3 time it did this i emailed garmin customer service the had me clarify on three different responses which came early morning so i assume customer service is in india i had at least 7 responses and a phone call while i was at work from garmin with no solutions except to retry installing with the disc finally i told him I had just get a magellan or a tomtom he used the old we are an american company and i should reconsider i am very pro american made purchasing but between your customer service probably in india and your product making my gps a useless brick i will shop else where thank you very much,168,7
1427,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have tried to install it for about 5 hours at this point i have tried three computers at first it would crash early on but i was able to bypass the autorun and start the installer manually at this point i was able to get it to download all the updates but it took two hours i have a very fast connection but it was very slow it was within 1 minute of being done when the installer program crashed now when i start over it wants to download from the beginning it is not worth it if i could just return it i would but i have entered my key so i am stuck,116,8
1428,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,my nuvi 200 just did n't have enough room to accomadate the full united states maps so you have to select the next best map to suit your needs easy install tho,30,9
1429,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this was so much easier than the download process from garmin i updated my nuvi 650 with no problems,19,10
1430,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i am one of those who purchased the code sunday may 2 and could not download it it is working fine now i am happy to report and it is updating just fine i docked them a star for the pain yesterday,42,11
1431,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was great roads that i would not come up previously now come up when i enter the address keeping the maps updated ensures new roads are available and the cd was so easy to use i highly recommend it,40,12
1432,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i ordered the 2009 version cancelled it then received the 2010 version in 2 days 2010 version was wrong and i still have to return 2009amazons ordering is constantly wrong,30,13
1433,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i wish i had read more of the reviews and forums beforehand this has been a time consuming process due to the limited information they provide up front and lengthy customer service wait times tried garmins online help and email help but they continue to provide the same steps after explaining in detail it has not resolved the issue no detailed maps found that support routing,66,14
1434,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have downloaded the garmin update into my unit and find that there has not been any update at all the unit still insists that i need to update it and i do not know what to do please contact me if at all possible with either a new unit or a suggestion as to how to make this work thank you,62,15
1435,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,after spending [ ] to update the maps on my garmin nuvi 265 t i now have a gps which takes 5 minutes to turn andup the maps and it is completely silent no sound i checked the volume settings and it is at 80 t no soun bud comes out of the unit try getting support from garmin every time i call i am put on hold with an estimated wait time of at least 30 minutes who has time for that i think i will just go out and buy a tom tom which is what i should have done in the first place instead of updating something 3 years old,113,16
1436,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,easy to use and invaluable provided the updates i needed and did not lock me into anything more than a one-time upgrade as i might get a new gps sometime soon,30,17
1437,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i needed to update my streetpilot c550 since it was several years old i read in other reviews of some horrors with some of the updates i will have to say i had no problem eventhough it took several hours i am now seeing highways that had not been on my garmin previously the only reason i gave it only four stars is the cost of the update the price is rather steep for a one time use,79,18
1438,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,the ordering shipping and receipt process was excellent i am enjoying the product,13,19
1439,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i purchased the 2010 map update for my garmin gps soon after i installed the update on my gps the touch screen function of the unit froze up and ceased to work the unit will find the satellite start up as normal but will not allow any touch function to operate so the unit is now useless i do not konw if the update is responsible for this malfunction but my gps worked properly prior to the installation,77,20
1440,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i received the updates and installed them on my garmin it definitely made a difference there are streets on there that my old garmin maps did not recognize i am over all very pleased with the updated maps,37,21
1441,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i was hoping that this update would map some areas that were not included when i originally purchased my device did not happen to be fair the service that supplies map data to garmin is not doing their job and my friends bmw does not these areas correctly either it will be a few years before i do another update,60,22
1442,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was a snap to install i had tried updates online but had difficulty even getting my unit registered using the cd is much easier,25,23
1443,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,with the prices of gps units dropping it is tempting to just replace the whole unit as the maps age and need updating at full list price for an update that is exactly what i would have done but at a reasonable discounted price 50 rather than 70 i chose to do the update it was easy and went smoothly my 3 year old garmin gps is now as current maps-wise as new out-of-the-box unit my only wish and what would have made this upgrade 5 stars is that the software would also update the operating system of the nuvi and not just the map data the newer operating systems lock on to satellites much faster than the older ones and the map displays have been somewhat improved as well,130,24
1444,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i reside in a rural area of the southeast the garman 2010 map update gives significantly more detail and is much more reliable than the 2008 version although I am not terribly demanding it has not failed to locate any poi that i have requested,44,25
1445,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,the garmin gps software i purchased works as described several changes have been included i can recommend this procust,19,26
1446,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,the map update is listed as compatible with the nvi 200 series but it turns out that the update files are too big for the 200s internal memory it is possible to do the update but only by adding an sd card in the 200s slot and loading the bulk of the update onto that instead of the internal memory there is no documentation or web resource at garmin that i could find to explain this and the process for doing it is not entirely self-evident,86,27
1447,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,this map update is compatible with the zumo 550 i use for motorcycle touring the installation was easy although it took well over an hour unattended to complete i get these map updates every year and find them to be worth the price the update also installed a new version of mapsource the desktop application that allows creating routes that can be downloaded to the gps it is compatible with the existing data files so you will not lose access to routes you may have already created in prior versions an important tip this will only update one garmin unit keyed to the units serial number shortly after installing this map my garmin had to be replaced because i accidentally damaged the touchscreen a quick call to garmin after i received my replacement unit had them reassign this map update to the new units serial number so i couldit into the new gps good service from garmin,157,28
1448,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i do not know how many streets changed in the two years since i owned my nuvi 350 but not enough to warrant a new set of maps costing 60 to 70 for a product costing 199 but what really is upsetting is that i have two nuvi 350s one for my brother and they will not let me update both nuvis with one dvd this reminds me of the days when software publishers overpriced software and got rigid with copy protection schemes they stopped more legal sales than they stopped piracy eventually software publishers got more friendly about both prices and second installations with lots more happy customers for their efforts garmin should have allowed me to use my 60 map update on both nuvis or made it cheap enough i would not feel so ripped off now i am just ticked off next time I shall try tom-tom or wait for a decent iphone app,153,29
1449,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have received my garmin 2010 map updates on a timely basis and am satisfied with the product,18,30
1450,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,update would notinto my street pilot 7200 without tec help after tec help the 7200 did not perform as well as before the update many of the secondary roads were missing that came with the original program i would not recommend this update,45,31
1451,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,unfortunately i made a bad mistake this was not a garmin map it was just an update for the people who has a garmin with a older version of the map as i rated this a very good map and the price was somehow good,45,32
1452,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,bear in mind folks this cd will update only one garmin unit if you have 2 or more i have 3 one in each of 2 cars and 1 in my motor home you will have to buy 2 or more,42,33
1453,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this product updated my nuvi 650 with no glitches whatsoever the dvd installs to the computer first and then installs the updates to the gps the entire process took about 2 1/2 hours all i had to do was enter the key number on the inside of the dvd sleeve i did not have to go to the garmin site as i have seen others say they did there is now streets showing that did not show on my 2008 version,78,34
1454,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in the garmin numaps 2010 america one-time update we moved to a new city and were using our gps to locate stores for shopping the old maps led us to a fabric store and many others that were no longer there we were told by neighboring stores that a particular store had not been there for 10 years we thought the upgrade would solve the problem the first thing we did when we got the upgrade was look to see that this missing store had been eliminated it is still listed on the upgrade as are several other stores that have been closed for 3 years or more i do not really see any difference in the upgrade and i consider it wasted money,126,35
1455,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,upgraded my garmin with no hassle device boot up first time and everything seemed to be working perfectly good job garmin updated 3/26/2012 do not buy the one time upgrade anymore one can get the life time map update for a little more for the life time of the gps it is a worthwhile investment happy driving,56,36
1456,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i must not have looked at it very hard but i was expecting a more up-to-date cd instead of 2011 update is there anything i can do to get a more up-to-date cd for my garmin nuvi,37,37
1457,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,did not include some map updates made between 2007 and 2009 what a joke i want my money back,19,38
1458,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,thanks for the article works great thanks for sending vyu u harto po old gt km u lo re u,20,39
1459,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have an old garmin unit and i did not want to pay for a lifetime map update since I shall be purchasing a new unit in a year or so and all the new units come with lifetime updates while i was waiting to purchase the new unit this one time update seemed like a greatthe microsd card works great i plugged it into my unit and the new maps were included i will use this for a year or so and then buy my new unit great deal,90,40
1460,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,was just what i needed to update my garmin save me from buying a new one now i need a new battery,22,41
1461,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,microsoft mappoint is good for two types of users those who need a super gps and those who need to create maps to go with their presentations and analysis with a gps puck not included ms mappoint becomes a great gps for salesmen delivery men and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner most gps devices fail in this regard they work great from point a to b and could include a detour but forget about going to ten locations it would be great if ms had a self-contained gps device not a laptop which could be programed with the information generated from mappoint by using a pc as the user interface it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen as for the maps it generates we are currently analysing a coal mine and our pitch book was much more comprehensive as a result of using mappoint over copying and pasting googlemaps and the like,169,0
1462,Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,i have been using this program for the past few weeks and am very satisfied with it the software installed and ran without problems on my windows 7 ultimate machine i was dissapointed that the usual irritating microsft activation technology was used if the user just wants a mapping program then microsoft streets and trips 2010 is a cheaper and more practical way to go the programs interface is extremely similar to streets and trips 2010 mappoint is for use by business people who want to research demographics and use other data available for neighborhoods they are interested in the capability for interface with excel is provided and seemed to work well,112,1
1463,Software,B002LLK5CO,5.0,positive,a great piece of software for using a map as a reference user needs a good background in excell or they can be lost,24,2
1464,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,was used and did notcorrectly told by microsoft it wa obsolete so the do not support it an go to forrum for help bad registry keys had to send it back,34,3
1465,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,old version not a terribly relevant product now with the popularity of smart phone and expanding internet cell coverage with free access to really good maps from other companies,29,4
1466,Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this product i can not find 40 percent of the existing addresses I have entered google map finds them even mss own bing maps finds them but not mappoint 2010 I am sorry i bought it,38,5
1467,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i got this product mainly to import maps into word documents the interface works seamlessly the maps are gorgeous and with a high level of detail perfect for a multitude of applications including illustrations for flyers maps diaries blogs or journals,41,6
1468,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i recently purchased mappoint 2010 through amazon so the price was already better than buying it directly from microsoft or at any office supply stores i am finding it to be very useful for my business we have to generate a lot of maps for our clients and mappoint is better than alternative mapping software from the standpoint of clarity of the maps and boundary definitions we do not need the wayfinding function so having that is of no value we use the territory function to highlight market areas by county or zip code that works okay but is a little cumbersome i also find transferring a map to word or powerpoint documents to be more difficult that it should be smartdraw is easier and it is not even a microsoft product,131,7
1469,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,it is marginally ok for mapping addresses and mapping simple fields but you can not do more advanced functions such as exporting business names addresses and more for this i had to write custom code and extract into excel it has ended up being of little value from a business standpoint absolutely do not buy thinking it can be used as a cheap gis tool,63,8
1470,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i liked the microsoft mappoint 2010 software it was easy to install and works well with vista the software is also easy to navigate and fun to use however it may not be for everyone it seems to have features you may not even use if you just need it to go from point a to b but if you need it for work related purposes or even to map out an itinerary with stops then look no further and the price may even be worth it,87,9
1471,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,i will give it to microsoft when it comes to mappoint it has always been a breeze to setup relatively simple to use and very effective at what it does that being said there has not enough new content in mappoint 2010 to justify an upgrade if you have any earlier version of the software unless you absolutely need the new features the improvements on mappoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor pushpin management has been overhauled and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from map settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation also you are now able to import export gpx files making for easier data sharing if you need new features like these then by all means i would recommend purchasing mappoint 2010 if this is your first purchase of mappoint take advantage of the free trial download online and also compare mappoints features to those of the cheaper microsoft streets and trips 2010 personally that is what i use most often and it is perfectly suited for my individual needs,182,10
1472,Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,I have had this program for a while now and i can confirm that it is not that good however it is better than streets and trips it has the same abilities but is also suited to add info to microsoft office applications i can see how some businesses could save the cost of the software very easily but if you just want a street guide go with s and t what worries me considerably is that microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application bing maps this application is only available direct from microsoft and the cost varies with the number of seats you license that makes me wonder how long mappoint will be available and whether bing maps will be a better program in addition other map companies like google may already have similar applications or be about to release them i suggest you do a lot of research before you choose which application you will buy,159,11
1473,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,first if you plan to sync and use this software in conjunction with a gps device you would better have the garmin brand preferably the latest one moreover if you business extends into canada this software will not be of much use for someone who wishes to put together say a national sales presentation or wishes to analyze data by geographic localities mappoint might be just the ticket given the number of options available for businesses today however this software seems overpriced a bit outdated even irrelevant and limited for most purposes other reviewers have rightly pointed out some of it is other shortcomings and limitations on the other hand if your business needs the specific capabilities that this particular program offers you will not find a better alternative what it does do it does relatively well if not easily,138,12
1474,Software,B002LLK5CO,2.0,negative,mappoint does not recognize some major streets in the community in which i am plotting data technical support was not able to help product not worth my time and effort if it does not work properly,33,13
1475,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,i have previous versions of microsoft streets and trips and have used it numerous times for maps and vacation plannning as well as it is gps capabilities microsoft map point is basically the big brother of ms streets and trips however it adds the ability to download maps to a gps device which is definitely a nice add-on and something i wish streets and trips could do and it adds the ability to import or link contact location data from ms outlook and display it custom maps beyond that i can not see where it really adds enough features to be worth the much higher price they charge for map point as opposed to streets and trips but it does run well and does all the functions it is supposed to do so if you really need to easily link and map your outlook customer data then this is the way to go,152,14
1476,Software,B002LLK5CO,4.0,positive,sometimes the position of the location flag is not very accurate and the data must be pristine as the software can not deal with post office box numbers that are on the same line as the addresses garbage in garbage out sometimes it gets confused if county road is abbreviated as cr or c r or even county road so clean up the data in excel before importing it into map point but for what i paid for the software i am satisfied,82,15
1477,Software,B002LLK5CO,1.0,negative,there has almost no configuration and to be perfectly frank the resulting maps look like crap the icons are of very poor image quality even if you manage to import a custom one because the pixel range is so darn small and again almost no configurability i feel sorry for everyone including myself stuck using this horribly designed software,61,16
1478,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,been using this product for 3 years total and 2 years on multi user after learning curve we depend on it totally i had to call tech support twice when we converted to multi user but we caused all our problem highly recommend for mac users besides what else is available that can beat it and stay in the nac world,62,0
1479,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,although quickbooks is not geared to handling books for outside salesmen it can be accomodated to give you access to information that you need i have not found another product that can do this running our home based small business it is important to keep records on commissions to sub-reps and income from multiple businesses that we represent quickbooks does this,60,1
1480,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,constant crashing longtimes reports that will not run can not tag line items in purchase orders to a job it is a terrible product and i only use it because i have to,32,2
1481,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I am not an accountant so i do not use all the capability of the program for what i need it works fine my complaint is every new version of mac os has required me to buy a complete new version of quickbooks i started out years ago with a windows version paid full price then switched to mac bought another version at full price then when we went to snow leopard had to buy another new version and the same with lion so i have over the course of 5 years purchased the program 4 times this is crazy i could see some reduced upgrade price being fair but re-buying the whole program is just not right because of this i can not recommend this product to someone who is looking for an accounting program,134,3
1482,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have had an awful time with qb mac since my purchase i wish i could return it and go back to qb for windows i have had constant technical issues and no one in technical support can help i think there are great things about the program if only they worked correctly i am incredibly disappointed and if it was not for the brand new mac computer i would go back to using qb for windows in a heartbeat,79,4
1483,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used quick books for windows for 20 years and just made the switch 6 months ago to a mac all my data converged into qb for mac flawlessly it is very easy and user friendly,37,5
1484,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb for mac really sucks for inventory you can not upload from excel unless you save as a txt file then change to an iff file while on desk top even then some feild are missing,35,6
1485,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,qb has been great for my trucking business this accounting software has really helped keep my business organized little square for mac has been a huge help for any accounting questions i have i would recommend it to anyone trying to keep track of their money,46,7
1486,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,disappointed in intuit they claim that you can make copies for windows users ie accountants but it does not work well when you call tech support they tell you not to do it so how if i am a mac user and my accountant is a pc user am i supposed to give him my account to reconcile also it does not share the same features as qb for windows like alias,72,8
1487,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quick books is a great program but the invoicing module desperately needs to be more flexible and robust i can not format invoices in a way that really works for me or add the text i need to,37,9
1488,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,moving from windows to mac qb was easy and wish i had done it sooner well worth the purchase for the four varied companies for which i keep books,29,10
1489,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we have been waiting for intuit to give mac the full set of features and qb 2011 was the first one that did while it is nice to use it on my mac it has all the same problems as regular qb it crashes once a day if not more we have had a hard time with several of the features it will kick me out for no reason if there is another user unfortunately for us the switching cost of going to another accounting software would be to great but if i was a first time buyer i would tell you to look long and hard at your choices as this may not be the best one,118,11
1490,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love this version of quickbooks better yet because i purchased it on amazon when my hard drive crashed last year all i had to do was log on and re-download the software such an easy recovery the interface is clean and simple I have had a few problems with printing checks it does not recognize they have printed and freezes up my print queue but other than that it is been really easy to use and switch from pc,76,12
1491,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,compared to qb for windows this falls flat too many annoying bugs accounts are slow to update and overall this is just tedious to use wish i stayed with the windows version that version is fantastic,37,13
1492,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this program is not user-friendly at all I am a contractor and purchased this program after it was referred to me by a sub-contractor that i have become friends with I am admittedly not a great business man i do not have a business degree of any kind and i struggle to keep up with my paperwork which is why i purchased this program it is difficult to say the least if you have used previous quickbooks programs and are familiar with it all then maybe it will work better for you but i was previously using quicken 2000 and this is ten times more complicated that being said if you are more business savvy than i am which I am guessing most of you are then this program ight be for you because it really does do everything except payroll payroll costs more a lot more,143,14
1493,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,there are some extremely annoying quirks in this mac version of quickbooks entries rearrange themselves in the ledgers according to check or transaction numbers rather than date which is not the same system as used by my bank on their statements so reconciling is a pain i prefer single-line entries only the ledger keeps flipping back to double-line entries almost on it is own also the backup process presumably designed to improve upon the previous or pc version is actually not an improvement at all as it is no longer simple to save only the 3 most recent backups rather than the whole slew this version of quickbooks is clumsy and not well thought through by the programmers needs workquickbooks 2011 for mac [ old version ],126,15
1494,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,we have a very small business but the same processes need to happen as in a large company quickbooks allows me do everything we need related to our finances without having to hire another staff person,36,16
1495,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,after using quick books for 15 years the switch from pc to mac versions has been awful screens are confusing many reports are missing time to learn the new program was a lot longer than i expected as a regular user i am abandoning the mac version and going back to pc very disappointed intuit should take this off the market until they can get it right,68,17
1496,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,this product lacks the conveniences contained in intuits qb for windows every customization is a battle it seems i have used qb for mac 2011 for nearly a year now and am ready to get another pc and go back to the productivity and speed i used to enjoy i can not stand the payroll section of qb for mac or the payroll support staff and the price for payroll support,70,18
1497,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i wish i would have known that i would need to pay extra for support i wish i would have know that when reconciling accounts the mac version does not have the same features as the windows version ie unable to sort data by dollar amount unable to obtain a reconcilement discrepancy report,53,19
1498,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,love my new mac but the intuit software quicken and quick books does not compare with the microsoft versions i have been a quicken user for my personal account since their inception but i am greatly disappointed in the mac product i assume that this is due to not selling as many mac versions and therefore less time and money were spent on developing it there are extra steps necessary in the mac products more so in quicken than in quickbooks the reconcile is also an example of an inferior product,91,20
1499,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,I have been using qb99 with windows and got a mac in jan and wanted to get the current version with some help from my qb consultant we converted to qb for mac i love it all my old numbers imported flawlessly and now I am much better organized,47,21
1500,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i think i like the quickbooks for mac much better than windows very easy to use and not hard at all to transfer from windows to mac did not lose anything in the transfer,33,22
1501,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,this is the first business accounting software I have personally used in a long time i picked up the software quickly and find it easy to use and generally user friendly no problems getting it to do what i need in my construction business but I am disappointed the mac version is not as full featured as the pc version based on comments from my accountant i feel like I am using a 5 year old version of the pc software it works fine just has limitations i know the pc version does not have I am also disappointed the quickbooks payroll for mac defaults to adobe for printing and viewing files macs preview works just fine in quickbooks why does not it also work with quickbooks payroll for mac,123,23
1502,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks on the mac is super easy i was familiar with qb on a pc so perhaps had an easier time getting started with it on the mac it is user-friendly for all the purposes i need to use it i definitely recommend it,43,24
1503,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,my business depends on invoices being correct and this program always has the wrong date on the invoice most of the time i do not notice it until it is too late email invoice it is quite embarrassing to be sending things to customer that are wrong i have asked your technical team to help and that was useless i never had a problem when i used quickbooks with my pc your mac version falls way short of what it could be almost forgot another thing when your program un dates the financial institution information it does absolutely nothing except stay in a non-responsive mode i have to force quit since it never does anything except prevent me from using the program i would never have used this mac quickbooks if i would have known it had this many problems actually there are more but for now those are the only things that come to mind after using this software for about 4 months dr locke,163,25
1504,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,with no ability to create an accountants file it makes for a lot of extra work my accountant writes out changes by hand and then i input everything the windows version has this option why not mac,37,26
1505,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i find it harder to use for budgeting purposes than quicken was i was using quicken on my pc and am considering returning to it,25,27
1506,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have used quickbooks for windows for over 10 years and was very satisfied with is performance and reliability quick books for mac has not been as good it seems clumsy and is not as easy to use,38,28
1507,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac 2011 omits many functions that can be found on the pc version the lack of inventory tracking is a big one why would such a seemingly easy and very needed basic function not be in the mac version,41,29
1508,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i really love the qb upgrade from pc to mac and the smooth ease to transfer all my files into the new format further it is really easy to use,30,30
1509,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,if you only use a mac and you are brand new to quickbooks you should have no problem with this product i have heard horror stories about quickbooks for mac but if you do not know any other way it is just fine i have a very small business new business that i needed quickbooks for and i did not want to do the whole parallels thing so i decided just to give quickbooks for mac a shot as i mentioned earlier knowing no other way is key because you will not be comparing it to quickbooks for windows and you will find that all your needs are being met I have been completely satisfied,110,31
1510,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is great but it has a couple of drawbacks that are really annoying when i customize a report and save it the report column widths are not saved so each time i run the report i have to adjust the column widths also when entering a transaction in the register if the payee exists the details from the last transaction will automatically be copied to the current transaction if there is no detail to the transaction being entered that is no split it is not intuitive to go into the check itself to check that the memo line has not been overwritten by a detail memo line transferred from a previous transaction the result incorrect memos on checks if these are dumb user errors I had really like to know how to fix them,135,32
1511,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used qb for a very long time way before intuit made a version for the mac i have been a recent convert from the pc roughly 2 years it all came about because i had a series of viruses and window errors that drove me to the point of despair along came one of my good friends and colleagues with a gift of my very first mac a macbook i went from total despair to why the heck did not i do this years ago anyway i am know 100 mac luckily intuit has understood that migration from pcs to macs is an ongoing phenomena which will not slow down i started using qb for mac as soon as it came out it makes bookkeeping sooo easy neat and quick i should know i am an accountant by trade cpa I have used heavy duty systems and other light versions qb mac is hands down the best now if intuit made it is turbo tax software in mac then they would be hitting a home run i can not wait to see that happen have fun using qb for mac yucagreengo,188,33
1512,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,I have used quickbooks on various pcs for many years and loved the performance my boss decided to purchase a macbook as my replacement computer last year which meant converting my pc quickbooks file to a mac version i had noof all the limitations I had encounter as a result of this conversion and I am extremely frustrated by some very important functions that i simply can not do at all such as sending out an accountants copy for tax preparation so that I am able to continue to work in quickbooks until the accountant returns his revised copy to be integrated back into my file I have been quite disappointed and i sincerely hope that the mac version will soon be as good as the pc version,124,34
1513,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i am a small business owner that went from qb2009 for pc to qb2011 for mac and although i am not a professional in keeping books i can manage quite well the mac version is lacking in a few areas like price levels and the ability to change some categories of items but overall it is well designed and easy to navigate,62,35
1514,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,after reading several of the reviews prior to purchasing quickbooks 2011 for mac it is better than we expected our old version of quickbooks ran on a pc that was full of gliches delays and slow downs it had so many bugs just because it was installed on a pc in all honesty there are some annoying gliches for example sometimes if you click on invoices of checkbook you get pay sales tax or some other innappropriate response over all the ease and speed at which we can now work is well worth the few issues that come up here and there if you own a mac but are an avid quickbooks user we do recommend this product for home and small business use we maintain 2 businesses plus our personal financials with this program and are pleased with it,140,36
1515,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been a quickbooks user for over 20 years but always owned a pc recently a client bought a mac computer and he purchased quickbooks mac what a nightmare would not recommend it to anyone not user friendly and like i said i have years of experience with quickbooks the payroll online only is a complete pain in the butt and you never feel in control i hate this program and hope i can talk my client into changing back to a pc i do not even like giving it a 1 star rating but it will not let me leave it blank,102,37
1516,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,what a relief i get by using quickbooks it keeps me straight on tracking all of my expenses my invoicing and banking matters reports are easy to run and can be customized easily it makes my tax prep so much easier too love it,45,38
1517,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,works but 1 journal entries can not scroll forward and backward to see prior entries quickly as was possible on other windows version 2 chart of accounts not so user friendly to find out how to for example create or edit new accounts and more 4 stars needs some work for ease of use with payroll i tried to get payroll installed by calling intruit and quickbooks and it took 2 - 3 hours then even although i ordered it and gave my cc they did not install it it will be a long time before i waste that much more of my time on the chance that it might not get done again workarounds for 1 person companies are difficult and it would be nicer if allowed to workaround easier for one person for payroll without signing up since it is usually not worth it for one person companies to sign up for payrollquickbooks 2011 for mac [ old version ],158,39
1518,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,many many features from the pc version of quickbooks seem to be missing the help menu is also very weak,20,40
1519,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty,20,41
1520,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if it had the same features as the quickbooks for windows does then it would be a great product i hope that quickbooks for mac can catch up with the features available with quickbooks for windows,36,42
1521,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,reports are tedious in the mac version of qb along with many other tasks as well was hoping the 2011 mac version would solve many of these problems but alas it did not best to stay with windows when using quickbooks,41,43
1522,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there have been numerous problems with this version since it is inception we have had to carry intuit / quickbooks helps since we loaded it on earlier this year problems with financial statements and having to rebuild data have slowed our progress as an entity i had thought that this would be good for our mac shop but not at this point we even had to have the data rebuilt outside the organization quickbooks which was not easily implemented formatting compilation research backups you name it we have had problems,87,44
1523,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i love my new mac however quickbooks is really not mac compatible it takes so much longer to do everything i hate it you can not do multiple payments at one time the payment screen closes after each payment you can not right click on an invoice to receive payments,48,45
1524,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i really do not the on-line payroll very difficult to set up also no way to print an invoice for part of an estimate i would like to see a way to do that and to do payroll from the desktop like other quickbooks programs if i had known all the problems i would not have changed i wish they would make the contractor editions in a mac version,68,46
1525,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,not too versatile too worried about security who cares when it is only one user not too user friendly ancient,21,47
1526,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,I have been frustrated with quickbooks for the mac i have used other versions which are better organized I have had problems with qb crashing when I am using reports and told i just need to go to a newer version we do that and not only is the problem not resolved but now reports have been made more difficult to use there has no reason to require me to move my hands from the keyboard to the mouse in order to change the selection criteria for a report i know qb is a good product but not on the mac by cascade who works for peter,105,48
1527,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the quickbooks for mac is far away from the capabilities of the quickbooks for pc they haven a long way of improvements to go regretfully if you have a mac there is nothing else than using the qb for mac the worst part is the payroll service,47,49
1528,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i can not believe that my only option to understand this program is to take a class I have spend so many hours trying to figure out this stupid software i work in a tech company and have to deal with new software every day but I have never seen such a terrible product in my life what a waste of time and money,61,50
1529,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,if have used qb for windows and are desperate to use qb for your mac hold your nose and make the purchase but be aware that the mac version is far inferior to the windows version and if you purchase a couple weeks before a new version is released you are stuck so be careful to check if a new version is coming out soon customer service is an adversarial experience the qb rep first denies that the problem is with the system and accordingly you must pay for the advice if you persist and prevail the qb rep grudgingly helps ideally they take control over your computer and do it themselves because their oral instructions are awful and they fight with you as you try to explain the problem most importantly back up qb before calling for service so they do not delete your files if you ever wonder where bangalore institute of technology dropouts go to get jobs call qb customer service,165,51

1539,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,decided to make the switch from pc to mac had to purchase quikbooks for mac for my business converting was no problem and quikbooks for mac is almost completely identical to quikbooks for windows however if you use intuit payroll functions beware intuit has changed their services and to get automatic payroll updates you have to upgrade from basic package to intermediate or extended package i was very disappointed because i do not need more than the basic package for a business with one employee,85,61
1540,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i switched to an imac several years ago i ran quickbooks on windows for many years and just this last year switched to the mac version it is good but it could utilize the unique mac features much better it acts a lot like a converted windows version instead of a stand alone mac version it would be awesome if they could make an iphone app that would allow expenses to be entered on the go that would then wirelessly be entered on my office computer i must say that intuit is doing a much better job on the mac software than before i ran an emulator on my mac to run the windows version for quite a while because the mac version was not up to snuff now it is much better and so i switched,134,62

1543,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the pc version of qb was really just a basic inventory and sales program to manage my business a bare bones program but got the job done and was fairly easy to work with last year i switched to apple computers and qb was on all levels much more limited and difficult to work with compared to the pc version i am extremely disappointed it is almost like they intuit have put a minimal amount of effort to make their product available and easy to use for mac users,91,65

1549,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i was hoping it was the learning curve that was frustrating my change to quickbooks for mac i have used the pc version for many years and love it the mac version is confusing and there is nowhere to go for help without cost i am seriously considering purchasing and inexpensive pc or windows 7 to install on my mac so i can go back to the pc version,69,71
1550,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,took a little time to convert from pc to mac but was well worth it easey to use does every thing i want it to do and more very pleased with it i hope to use this program until i retire,41,72

1552,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for six years the first five were on a windows pc i have reported my problems to apple but the discrepancies are still there they are not huge but they are annoying my biggest problem is when I am writing a check click on an account and run the mouse over the account it does not show what is underneath the main account word like the sub category i might write a check with numerous accounts so it is really annoying the same thing happens in the bank register when you click on the account then run the mouse over it it needs to show what is underneath but it does not it is hard to check for mistakes so you have to do it all over again if there is doubt,135,74
1553,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i constantly have to re-enter data because of the frequent error messages i get from quickbooks and it often makes odd demands refusing to save what i just entered so i have to close the program and start all over again it is a maddening program and i wish I had stuck with the accounting system i set up myself in filemakerpro,60,75
1554,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is not user friendly in the slightest if you have the option continue using the pc version i actually clicked on write checks three times twice it asked me for my security question answer even although i have no requirements for a security question to be answered to write checks same thing happens when i try to create invoices i clicked about 5 times and it took me to the rate quickbooks for mac screen so i thought i would let everyone know what i think they need serious updates for this product,96,76

1560,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am really disappointed with quickbooks for mac putting in employee time is very limited on microsoft qb you have unlimited space to put in a description for your time we are a law office and can not always justify our fee in a short sentence also the reports are limited compared to microsoft qb and there is not a find feature i really wish mac qb had full capability and do not understand why it can not i really do not like using it at all,86,82
1561,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am looking to open a new business in the coming months and i have not done any research on accounting software just assuming i will be buying quickbooks for mac i am so happy i spent the time going through these reviews on amazon i have a mac and my business partner has a pc we were going to upgrade her to a mac so that we could have compatible os for software purposes such as quickbooks however i am now thinking that we will keep her pc and try to find a different accounting program i was amazed at the reviews left on this site the common issues for all of the reviewers strongly suggests that intuit needs to get it is act together thanks for all of the posts,130,83
1562,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been using quickbooks for mac for several months i have no prior quickbooks experience i found it easy to use and very helpful it seems virtually impossible to mess up things can easily be added deleted and moved it has been very useful being able to track my business progress via quickbook i do not know what i would have done without it my only complaint is the fact there is not a mobile phone app for mac users it is kind of crazy to have an iphone app available for windows users but not mac users really i hope this will be corrected soon having a mobile app that syncs with my computer would quickbooks really rock,119,84
1563,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,if you are transferring from windows to mac do not get parallels and use the windows version the mac version is not compatible with payroll so you have to sign up for their version which used to cost us 189 / year and now cost us 65 / month anytime you type a t in the check field it automatically puts in to print the autofill does not work as good as the windows versions windows info does not translate correctly at random times so you have to download it back to windows and then back to mac because rebuilding the data does not correct it if you are a setting up a new company or first time user it is ok but like i said at the beginning the windows version is better,129,85
1564,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,this is my firstinto quickbooks after being a long time quicken for windows user the church treasurer and i were trained on quickbooks together he was trained on the windows version while i was on the mac version they mirror each other relatively closely and if you know one you can certainly manage the other the only area of great disappointed was related to online banking the mac version does not have the capability to make online payments through your online banking system through quickbooks for mac this is a great feature with the windows product no double entry just key it once into the check register and send it to the bank for payment with quickbooks for mac i have to double key the entry i key it once into the quickbooks checking account register and then again into the online banking system when i download the statements from the bank quickbooks for mac recognizes the entry for the most part and matches them so i do not have to manually do it overall i am very satisfied with that one exception i use it for church accounting with a couple hundred thousand going through each year no issues to this point,204,86
1565,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am finding that the quickbood for macs has a lot of problems that i had never encountered with quickbook for pcs i was debating getting a mac just because i use my computer a lot for quickbooks and the reviews for macs quickbook were bad my daughter decided to get me a mac for xmas and as much as i loved my mac have had many many problems,69,87
1566,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i run the books for our home owners association we switched to quickbooks for mac a year and a half ago it simplifies everything to be able to send monthly reports in just a few seconds and to email invoices saves a lot of time the 2011 updates are more mac-like i especially like the ability to customize reports so they are not as bland looking great program,67,88
1567,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,all in all it works like the qbooks for windows except often whenever i go into an account it asks for a security question which is very annoying,29,89
1568,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,this product is the worst some of the selections just do not click open for example i can not open one check book register today and the option to place payments called receive payments is simply not responding this happens daily so i am constantly behind soon i will give up and hire a bookkeeper sigh,53,90
1569,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,had qb for pc for 8 years then made the switch to mac there are many glitches within the software frustrating,21,91
1570,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there is only one version for mac and it does not include any contractor options i had to pay a quickbooks expert to format my invoices and estimates,28,92
1571,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we use to enjoy quick books multi user addition on our pcs we now use quick books for mac multi user mode it lacks many features that we used on the pc version we are disappointed but continue to use it i hope you keep working on it until you incorporate the features that were available on quick books premier dan endsley owner endmark sales and marketing,67,93
1572,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,full of bugs every time i get an update i think maybe this time they fixed the bugs but alas no very poorly designed integration into the mac os like the title says it gets the job done but very poorly,41,94
1573,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as soon as i bought it i was able to download it which was amazing great program perfect for small business such as ours,24,95
1574,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,a major bug that has cost us lost data and time is the no security question exists error message it keeps popping up when we need to access our bank account intuit please fix it another annoying bug that quickbooks needs to fix is that we are unable to remove a user once created a user can not be removed it became annoying when the list of old users got longer and longer we are still trying to figure out how to network quickbooks between two macs apparently the data can not be stored on a server the data must be stored on one of our computers that means if that computer is not on i can not access my quickbooks data from my laptop and if i store the data on my laptop if i take the laptop out of the office my bookkeeper has no access to the data either i think that is stupid,154,96
1575,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,previous user on pc thought it would be easy transition it works but has some flaws my invoices occasionally put the previous days date on the first invoice of the day annoying,32,97
1576,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i upgraded as the 2010 version would not work with lion i noticed very little difference from qb mac 10 if you liked qb 10 you will like this one also it is a good program yes i know it is not qb windows but it functions well is stable and is simple to navigate if you or your accountant are used to qb windows if there are functionality changes I am not missing them considering that intuit has a disgraceful record of supporting osx this program is a miracle just look at what quicken for mac turned into quicken essentials for mac which is the poorest reviewed program I have ever seen if you have a mac and you need an accounting program this is the one to get,127,98
1577,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i do not know why quickbooks and quicken for mac are so bad compared to the pc version i use both and dread using it on the mac and have used both products for years and really enjoy it on pc,40,99
1578,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I had give it 3 stars if it was not missing functions that the pc version has very buggy three updates so far and they still can not get it fixed the bookkeeper we use and a pro w / quickbooks can not figure how to work with some of the issues,46,100
1579,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i bought an apple imac and wanted to use it with quickbooks mistake more difficult to use than the windows-based version still can not figure out how to get the ledger to show up without repeatedly clicking on the register icon and have it do absolutely nothing the help you get when you call in is completely frustrating i avoid calling even if i have a problem because it is so terrible they speak english but they do not understand what you are saying and they always want to sell you something else they eventually get the issue solved but at a great expense of my time because of the language barrier i used to do my own payroll but will now have to go to a payroll service to get it done and will not use the quickbooks payroll because of it being dis-jointed I am not fond of the company they are irritating,147,101
1580,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have run several quickbooks all for mac i have always liked the products as long as i am the only one working on it and it is on our macs the problem is when you bring in a bookkeeper or accountant and they need to pull data or share data to compress and reformat is frustrating i have had intuit qb for mac specialists helping and still ran into issuestry qb essentials online it is cloud type tech so easier for others to access,83,102
1581,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,great but no app all the apps are for quickbook for windows figure that one out intuit iphone app for windows only,22,103
1582,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been an exclusive pc person since the beginning of computers but have switched to macs quickbooks works well in the mac format,24,104
1583,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i bought quickbooks to help me organize my small business it makes emailing estimates and invoices to my clients so much easier quickbooks for mac makes running a small business very efficient my accountant loves it because all my business receivables and expenses are right there in my mac and printing checks is a cinch i love it i would recommend this program to any business owner,67,105
1584,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quickbooks 2011 for mac is a great software one of the most user friendly accountant softwares of all times and very intuitive few bugs although and restricted on vat countries payments and customizing invoices advisable,35,106
1585,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the mac version of quickbooks is awful it lacks significant functionality of the windows versions there are few if any third-party plug-ins available because intuit has not released a software development kit if you are going to convert to mac plan to add the cost of vmware fusion and windows 7 so you can run quickbooks in windows,57,107
1586,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as a church treasurer quickbooks has made my work so much easier all of the necessary reports and records a readily available no matter what my pastor asks for,29,108
1587,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i love my mac my employees love having an all-mac office the only downside is being stuck with qb for mac it is not as robust as qb for pcs also intuit treat mac owners like second class citizens the strong message they send us is want real quickbooks buy a pc there is a real opportunity for someone to develop a qb-like program for macs one that has real customer support and has been developed by someone who does not hate macs i use qb because i do not have time to find an alternative as soon as i do I am gone,100,109
1588,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i read the reviews before i purchased quickbook for mac 2011 and was a bit worried with what others said with the 60 day trial period i figured what do i have to lose i have to say it is very easy to use i spent about an hour navigating the different modules to get a feel for the layout and workflow quickbooks makes it easy to enter new customer bills and invoices I have used a lot of different erps and crms some better and some worse as a small business owner it has saved me a lot of time compared to the spreadsheet accounting i was using it is not perfect but it has increased my productivity and decrease my stress,121,110
1589,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac up to and including version 2011 takes care of the most basic accounting / bookeeping needs but that is about it why does not it just have all of the features and functionality of qb pro for pc it is just that simple let me sort in the reconciliation window by column let me find anon the chart of accounts by typing in an account number sub account number or part of an account title or sub account title just the simple things would be a great start and some of these were available in qb for mac 2007 why are not they in this version also the multiuser version is horrendous very little real network-level configuration going on there it just really does not work well at all after purchase we installed then uninstalled and are back to copying files including spending significant time with intuit support and our mac and qb knowledgeable techs frankly at this rate why bother with a mac version at all and just let us mac folks have a pc in the corner to run qb it be just that much simpler on us all and not provide daily frustration with very simple functions beingthanks,199,111
1590,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i love many of the new features but you really need a package that is specific for the food industry restaurants cafes and bakeries especially also this program has tons of bugs ie error messages not printing taking forever to print sometimes and other times is quite efficient this version is much easier but still clumsy in many ways,59,112
1591,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i had to buy the 2011 version of quickbooks for mac because the 2010 version does not work with osx lion i could no longer print or email any invoices with my 2010 version and after reading through several forums i discovered my only solution to be buying yet another almost 200 version of this rudimentary software this does not help my feelings towards a company that seems as slow as a dinosaur to make good products buy this only if you have to hopefully some company will come out with better business software for macs,95,113
1592,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this product is very difficult to use compared to the pc version the most basic tasks like setting the ledger you want to open automatically when you click on the icon are frustrating and confusing the payroll situation is a flat out nightmare stay away,45,114
1593,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have spent more than 60 hours on the phone w intuit trying to sort out all the problems w quickbooks for mac 2011 i hired a tutor to try to help me I have paid her hundreds of dollars and she has not been able to get it to work properly either supposedly the pc version is good but i do not have a pc and do not want one I have even been paying 20 a month to intuit for tech support from them they have not sorted out the problems and i wish I had never bought this horrible horrible software it is a nightmare do not purchase this now is there any good book-keeping program on the market suitable for a small business owner w a mac i can not find one the person or company that actually comes up with a good one is going to make a gazillion dollars,148,115
1594,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quick books for mac is not user friendly when i transferred it over from windows i had to call the support line because it did not work like it said it should then the lady who i could barely understand because she did not speak english well told me that this call would be free but if i had to call anymore after for support i would have to pay for it or i could set up a monthly payment and call anytime i want not cool I have used quickbooks for windows for a few years and it was very user friendly quickbooks for mac almost made me bring my entire mac back to the apple store I am used to it now but still prefer quickbooks for windows I am even considering switching to another finance program,135,116
1595,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if you are used to quickbooks pc and are expecting the same experience on your mac do not bother I am sure you can find manny reasons if you do a bit of research online but quickbooks mac is a disaster no good job tracking no good invoicing it takes me 10 times the time it used to to make a progress invoice on this version in other words quickbooks mac is at a kindergarden level compared to the pc version intuit should look at all their false advertizing about the products capabilities and think twice before advertizing this version as comparable to the pc version horrible horrible horrible if there was a way to review thisand give it a negative star reading i would ps quickbooks premier user for 7 years,132,117
1596,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i could wax in excruciating detail suffice it to say if you can not access your company file after loading a few bank registers and all you get from tech support is sales pitches for extended warranty forget it i am not sending a file to india or anywhere for what is obviously some glitch save your time and avoid frustration one star is too much how about a minus 3 stars for the time lost,74,118
1597,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks is a dream come true for our small business i took a class which i recommend for newbies like me this is a forgiving program which means corrections are not a big deal,34,119
1598,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i am just getting a business started and quickbooks will be able to help with all my reporting needs and accounts and for personal accounts will assist with budget formation and spending habits and allow me to identify tax information great product and good value,45,120
1599,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i do not like this version compared to the pc version i used for years it is not easy to use lots of things that i could do with pc version they do not have for mac i do not like that you can not send letters from this version i do not like the way it creates invoices from my memorized list they are random and not in alphabetical order i do not like that you can not print out time sheets it is just not user friendly my mac is but not the quickbooks for mac,89,121
1600,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,intuit obviously does not want my business as a mac user they consistently produce inferior products for the mac their support is garbage and now in order to run osx lion you have to upgrade to qb 2011 just to make it more painful intuit has priced their upgrade 10 high than the cost of buying a full version of qb 2011 on amazon thanks for showing me you do not want my business intuit,73,122
1601,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the multi-user quickbooks for mac is very slow it takes forever to bring up reports and sometimes locks up window version is much better but quickbooks will not support the windows version via parallels go figure also the payroll feature is a scam they just want you to spend big bucks with them make sure you find other alternatives for your payroll if you are a smaller company basically do not buy if you do not have too i wish i did not,80,123
1602,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I have spent over 3000 in the past year purchasing quickbooks pro for my small one-person business this year and hiring a consultant to set it up it is clunky and clearly not optimized for the mac when i find that the print invoice feature does not work i spend hundreds getting my consultant to consider the question and then ultimately to advise me to use a work-around arrgh,68,124
1603,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,useless no support for multiple currencies and character limits 9 digits means this software is of no use for indonesia waste of money,24,125
1604,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have loved quickbooks on the pc i recently moved to a mac and expected similar sophistication and reliability plus payroll integration on the mac i do not recommend this change and in fact I am moving back to quickbooks on a virtual pc on the mac the mac version is crude compared to the pc version and the lack of payroll is unacceptable given the even cruder and inflexible online service required from intuit if you are going to do payroll I am stunned by the lack of parallel functionality with the pc product,92,126
1605,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,this version of quickbooks is not as complete and easy to use as the 2008 pro for windows sales taxes are much more difficult to pay and adjust the windows version has a button to adjust sales tax the mac version you have to create a journal entry when posting bills it is necessary to manually enter the job name on the posting screen even although you have a po with the job name on it i have been very disappointed in the mac version of this program,88,127
1606,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,frustrating product lacking many important and basic features that quickbooks pc has frustrating tech support they are extremely useless,19,128
1607,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,makes invoicing pos searching previous checks and invoices so easy it takes the hard work out of accounting and can easily be converted to and from a pc version great interface you do not have to even really understand accounting to use it yet the features it has makes it such a powerful accounting program if you want it to be enter your checks invoices and receipts and make up accounts on the fly fantastic reporting and searches that are customizable invoices are also customizable to the extent that you can even insert your company logo do your payroll here as well with a link to intuit payroll module it costs an extra 40 / month but the pc version this feature is build into the program for less than 200 you can have this fantastic accounting program working for you you would be crazy not to buy it,147,129
1608,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is very difficult to operate and does not work like in the pc terrible i constantly lose my latest version that i just updated,27,130
1609,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,did any of the geniuses at quickbooks not think to make qb for mac look and function the same as for windows could not have been that difficult to do that way the transition would have been seamless also have terrible trouble that hundreds of cleared transactions download despite already being cleared and none of my downloaded transactions ever match the ones in my ledger i spend hours longer doing work in qb for mac than i ever did in windows this is the only complaint i have ever had regarding anything mac,92,131
1610,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is different from the windows version it has a few bugs that need to be worked out and i wish i had a pc at work so i could use the regular version of quickbooks,38,132
1611,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,while the mac is far superior to any pc in existence qb for mac is fair at best many features we were used to before switching to mac are no longer there it seems like they just patched it to make it work we are looking at other software and will probably change within the next thirty days,58,133
1612,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i am new to quickbooks for mac as i normally use the pc version the mac version is quite different but it still functions very well there are a few things that i would change on the mac version but it still works great,44,134
1613,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,so unhappy with qb mac no one tells you how limited and not user friendly this product is wait a few years maybe they will get the kinks worked out,30,135
1614,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have a new mac book pro and the program still runs very slow it freezes and is slow this version compares very unfavorably with the windows version i will probably not use this software next year i will not change my mac i will rather change my accounting software to something that will work well with macs,58,136
1615,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,overall quickbooks for mac 2011 has done a good job helping me stay on top of my financial records for my small mental health practice i started out with the 2009 version which had better report customization this version makes it harder to modify memorized reports it is easier to start all over again rather than trying to make changes to an existing report my biggest complaint is neither version will automatically download bank transactions like you can in the pc version i use one of the major national banks and you would think quickbooks would have worked it out by now,102,137
1616,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not like the way payroll is handled you can not do it on you own like on a pc,19,138
1617,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,it is terrible it is my understanding that it can not handle a large database and i spend most of my time waiting for it to work,26,139
1618,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,love this quickbooks very easy to use came from pc quickbooks which had more options for data but I am a die hard mac fan pros nice clean easy to use program excellent support cons unable to make an estimate into a purchase order you have to reenter on pc version you can make an estimate into a purchase order and an invoice seems like this would be an easy fix,70,140
1619,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have a mac and had been using quicken home and business running virtually with parallels never liked theof having windows xp on my new mac hello that is why i switched to mac i was a little apprehensive on making the switch to quickbooks for mac after reading tons of reviews i would have to say the switch has been very easy and satisfying do not believe all the knocks from the pcers program is not perfect but has worked great so far for me i own a small residential cleaning and construction company and qb for mac meets all my current needs do not fear try it out for yourself and see and no i do not work for intuit godspeed from cincy,118,141
1620,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,intuit is not my favorite company pc versions go buggy and they keep selling newer versions when one only needed it to work andthis is accounting not rocket science why can not an older program keep running been hoping another company will take over until then i purchased a mac version it works but is clunky has not been fine tuned to run as smoothly as pc need to learn kb shortcuts as many commands are only menu driven interface with address book is a mystery to me as is starting estimates and invoices from some other number that 1 with the growing mac population i suspect intuit plans on selling betteer versions by forcing upgrade purchases,118,142
1621,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,all i heard was negative stuff about qb for mac i have a small business and decided to try it anyway could not be happier it does everything i need and is very easy to learn,35,143
1622,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,when entering items into statement charges it has never aged appropriately on the statements have contacted supported many occasions to no avail seems to have a lot of problems against the windows version i wish i had never switched to mac version,42,144

1624,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks for mac is an under-developed brutal necessity of life a bug filled cesspool intuit has it figured out most accountants use qb so it is become a standard you have to use it or risk a nightmare during tax season with you accountant the mac version of the program is unstable unpredictable glitchy and inflexible it is as if the intuit management decided that the growing market share of osx users was a necessary evil that they wanted to promote in their marketing but spend as few resources as possible developing this program irritates me to death every day,98,146
1625,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i bought this version for my mac thinking that it would be easier to use than the pc version i was seriously wrong as the mac version is not intuitive has far less features than the pc version and in general was a poor choice on my part there is actually a steeper learning curve for the mac version against the pc but it works i will say that the online payroll services are great,75,147
1626,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i have been using quicken and quickbooks for many years i have modified the format to match our construction company needs i do not use the icon format at all rather go directly to the pull down screens i am able to keep my accounts balance email invoices and provide our accountant with a file at tax time i am on a mac and was disappointed that i could not use the on line accounting i have a problem ever year importing my accountants changes it would be wonderful to have the accountant access my accounts online to prepare our returns as an established company it is not reasonable to re-enter all my data to be on line i need an import conversion thereby avoiding human entry errors it is a good product i had to take a class on use but once i did using qb is easy and reliable,151,148
1627,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,having been a super user of quickbooks enterprise accountants version and quickbooks pro and recommended the product to many clients i was a bit concerned about switching my day to day computer use to a mac having been a pc all my computer life i was especially concerned about quickbooks the mac version works beautifully and only has a few differences from the pc version that are perfectly easy to deal with ie the bank reconciliation process does not allow for sorting the transactions otherwise excellent job intuit,88,149
1628,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,quickbooks for mac is working ok after i got through the initial conversion from pc i had an older version on my pc and quickbooks initially did not want to help with the conversion at all telling me to find someone with a new version on their pc to convert it first on the pc side to make it compatible for a mac conversion after a lot of threats phone calls and so on i got them to convert it for free i have used quickbooks since 1996 but do not know if i would go through all of the hassle again it works ok although i liked some of the features of my old pc version better and it is very slow opening and closing but overall been dependable heather gray,130,150
1629,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,it is ok but has shortcomings like you can not set up how you want to sort your payables on a permanent basis every time you log in you have to reset them to sort the way you want really annoying,36,151
1630,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i am extremely unhappy with all of the misinformation about quickbooks for mac i have bought computer quickbooks 2011 program and now and support only to find out quickbooks does not support payroll which is the most important reason why i changed to mac so my is waisted ihave been a quickbooks customer for years and am gravely unhappy and screwed,62,152
1631,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quick books for mac is not user friendly and at least ten times more difficult that the quick books for pc it is difficult to move around,27,153
1632,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,many ways to get to the functions you want my only complaint is that there are merchant services credit card billing limitations on the mac that pc users get to enjoy,31,154
1633,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,very good product i wish i had more time to understand all of it is features i think it will be a standard for our business applications sincerely carrie s,29,155
1634,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,let us face it everybody knows that quickbooks sucks but they are the standard we all know that every chance they get they will nickel and dime you to death they come up with a new version every year that is basically like the last version and because either you or your accountant upgrade the other person is forced to upgrade what a scam i switched from windows to mac and of course had to pay hundreds of dollars again only to find out that the mac version does not support sending checks out through your bank there solution signing up for quicbooks online and paying monthly and of course qb online does not support it either do yourself a favor and by quicken or some other program,125,156
1635,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,you have got a mac you have got a small business you need quickbooks for mac you will hate it but it it is the only one that uses basic double entry bookkeeping instead of hiding it all from you if you have ever used it on windows you will hate it even more it obvious intuit considers mac to be a second-rate platform when i can find a real alternative i will get it it in a heartbeat I had write my own but i do not have the time,84,157
1636,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb 2011 is better than previous versions but even 2011 is not as powerful as the 2009 pc version mac is way behind in their programming,26,158
1637,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,the mac has saved me countless hours versus a pc transferring my data over from a pc and using quickbooks on the mac has been wonderful i also love being able to run credit cards with it there are still some small improvements and glitches to be addressed but overall very good sincerely rod,54,159
1638,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love quickbooks for mac the reports are very well designed and i like the fact that i can choose my favorite reports and memorize reports if you make a mistake it is not the end of the world you can easily change it,43,160
1639,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,the very best accounting application for the mac i have been using it for years probably since version 10 it is the quintessential program for completing the accounting requirements for several different corporations partnerships businesses that are sole-proprieterships and even a large charitable trust non-profit organizations of moderate size should find it more that adequate it is great for bank reconciliation and cutting checks,64,161
1640,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i have been using some form of quicken quickbooks for years when i switched to mac i was disappointed that intuit did not offer a version of quicken home and business for mac only pc i had to buy both the pc version and the mac version of quickbooks first to upgrade my home and business data to quikbooks pc and then the pc files could be imported to quickbooks for mac this did not bother me but after running quickbooks on mac for three years i am totally frustrated the program does not operate with anything close to the ease and convenience of the pc version i have purchased every new upgrade and yet nothing has addressed the issues i have with the software it does not memorize entries you have to manually re enter data over and over if you use the deposit function it does not enter this automatically in the register intuit needs to get it together and improve this product,166,162
1641,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not walk run away from this product as great user friendly the pc version of quickbooks is the mac version is diametrically opposed what a headache this is the 4th time i have lost all my work and have to start from scratch qb does not tell you that some of your information does not translate well when crossing over from pc to mac that is where all my headaches started i have nowhat I am going to do now other than go back to qb pc version because frankly i see no hope in redeeming the other,100,163
1642,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,over the years intuit has really improved quickbooks for mac into a full-featured program that allows me to easily send my financial information to my accountant for review he uses windows and we easily transfer data back and forth works great,41,164
1643,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,this software is pretty good and legit there is no way i would do my own payroll without software like this,21,165
1644,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,we purchased multi-user quick books for mac this past february we are still inputting so hopefully we can go live with this product in august 2011 we have noticed that the mac version is not at all like the pc version therefore we have had to go around and create more detail so we can use this program so at this moment it has not been very productive how about making quick books for mac like your pc version we do not understand why that can not happen thank you for allowing us the opportunity to review this product hopefully in 6 months we can give you an excellent review,108,166
1645,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i switched from windows to mac for quickbooks i have had no problems with the transfer process mac version is different you just need to take the time to maneuver around and find how to do certain things such as reports the payroll system is great and affordable i really like it i can also do payroll from my iphone which is an greater plus when I am not in the office at my computer,74,167
1646,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have used quickbooks 2011 for mac for about two years and it is a great tool for invoicing balance sheets and income statements i especially like the feature that allows you to download my bank statements into the program and reconcile easy to transfer this information to my accountant for tax filing purposes like the program a lot,59,168
1647,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i previously used quickbooks for windows and switched to quickbooks for mac 2011 when i bought a mac the quickbooks for mac is clearly an inferior product than the windows version hopefully as more people buy macs intuit will improve the product,42,169
1648,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been using qb for mac multi user since december 2010 and i think that it is a horrible program it will randomly disconnect it will randomly not save work that i have done i would much rather use qb for pc it is a much better program,49,170
1649,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,it does not allow you to change the numbers on the checks you want to print if you make a mistake you have to print on a blank sheet in order to get the proper check number this is just one of the many faults with the qb for mac i love my mac and do not want to have to get a pc just for quick books i would look for another software but unfortunately this is what my accountant uses so I am stuck with this lousy program,87,171
1650,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,the mac version is much less versatile than the quickbooks pro version for pc sometimes i feel like I have stepped back 10 years when i use the version on my mac,31,172
1651,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i used qb-windows for years i was not crazy about it but i used it i did not like the way you are essentially forced to upgrade every 3 years but it worked ok qb-mac is garbage nothing is easy getting to your home page is difficult reconciling your bank statement will take 3 times as much effort do not waste your money on qb-mac,63,173
1652,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks for mac does not have anything close to the functionality or features of quickbooks for the pc intuit for whatever reason has decided to abandon it is mac users for this product quickbooks for mac is full of bugs and does not do some of the basic things required by accounting software,52,174
1653,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,when i am printing out statements the system crashes a lot i can not enter data as quickly as with my pc so i have to force myself to slow down a bit i have not figured out how to mobileme from my desktop to my laptop and no once at the apple store can help me because they do not know quickbooks other than the about issues i love my mac quickbooks,73,175
1654,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,qb for the mac crashes on a regular basis and must be restarted sometimes with a reboot of the computer payroll is not included so profitability reports are not available amounts in the reconciliation can not be sorted based on amount so it is almost impossible to reconcile once / month many other features available in qb for the pc are missing hope this is resolved in qb 2012,67,176
1655,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i have had sooo many issues with mac 2011 do not get it stay with 2010 they have too many issues they need to work on i have sent my file in twice to get repaired i still can not download transactions properly,42,177
1656,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i used quick books for pc with great results i made the switch over to mac computers which has been wonderful but the quick books for mac does not work well at all the biggest problem is that it does not interface with online banking and i can not pay bills from within the quick books for mac environment very disappointing overall it is a poor product which is surprising because the pc version is amazing,72,178
1657,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,like all intuit products quickbooks for mac is easy to use and provides a surprisingly full suite of features i am using the payroll service and the merchant bank service in addition to the usual features all are easy to set up work well and are easy to use,49,179
1658,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i am used to using quicken for personal accounting so when i opened my business i chose quickbooks 2011 for mac for my accounting software once i got used to the differences between the two programs i have found it easy to use in general the one piece that i find hard to use is the pay bills section it seems that i often am entering the wrong date for the bill payment but that is a minor issue i wish the program had a better way to show payments i have already set up for future payment in my checking account,102,180
1659,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,intuit still has pretty much a monopoly in this space for small business this is aimprovement over the past mac version and now performs considerably better than even the pc version but still a strangely weak package for what you would expect search as always is horrible reporting is pretty much still a joke and they have left out even the few useful features from the pc side we see a very strange and worrisome problem with moving files from the mac to pc versions balance sheet stays the same but phantom bills show up in the vendor center you would think that almost all of this could be cloud based by now but their online offering just is not there yet updated review software is full of bugs,130,181
1660,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i just purchased qb 2011 for mac however when i tried to open by prior mac qb2009 file it would not open i called technical support and they got farther to the password screen but the windows password did not work i had to purchase a service plan and send the file to them to rebuild i do not have it back yet to tell you if that worked if you read other reviews on this site you will see that i am not the only one with this problem i found it deplorable that the qb tech support person acknowledged it is a bug on there end but still makes me pay to rebuild the file and i was told there was no initial technical support so if you are buying this and do have problems be prepared to pay for tech support reputable software companies provide at least 30 days free support and do not charge to repair a known bug shame on you intuit,165,182
1661,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i love quickbooks the versatility and availability thru quickbooks i have developed and train others to use a simple method to track and reconcile items commonly used in the qsr industry such as gift card sales frequent diner discount cards and most commonly used credit cards many if not most corporations do not offer set up and training to new franchisees at the onset quickbooks offers an easily understood readily accessible product to those franchisees who with a small amount of additional training can be off and running their own businesses,91,183
1662,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,very confusing have use quickbooks pro for years on my pc and it worked great this is even difficult to open to bank account ask for password but tells you there is no password hate the program i will be changing,41,184
1663,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quick books is justly popular not only will it help you keep the books but it also captures quite a lot of data you will have the info you need for billing for determining the level of profitability of your jobs and for managing contractors as well as employees it is easy to install and easy enough to figure out but you will be more successful if you do not have a background in accounting if you pick up an instruction book the documentation that comes with the program is not nearly enough,88,185
1664,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,the mac version is not compatible with the pc version if i do work on my mac and then save it in a windows format for my bookkeeper to use transactions are lost those who use macs should not buy this product,42,186
1665,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,why is the upgrade with instant savings for previous quickbooks users more expensive that a new version you can buy anywhere online is this how intuit intends to reward loyal customers who have been using and paying for the software for the last 15 years give me a break do you think we are all idiots,56,187
1666,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,you have to be an accountant to understand how to even set up this application there is not even a book written for the mac beside a useless ebook i never used the pc version that people say is better but this mac version needs to be more user friendly I am not an accountant that is why i bought this in the first place so far it has been a waste of money it is supposed to sync with my pos software and my bank online we could accomplish neither,87,188
1667,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,if you have a bookkeeper who has any of the latest pc versions of quickbooks you will still lose bank reconciliations memorized transactions reportsjust to name a few when you import back and forth between the pc and mac version intuit has been working hard on this issue for more than 4 years but people are still losing a ton of data most times they work with a pc-based bookkeeper for those that want to purchase quickbooks 2011 they are currently having a sale it is 18395 however if you already own a copy of quickbooks they support their past customers with an upgrade discount the price is just 18395,112,189
1668,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i used quickbooks to do the accounting for my wifes business and it always worked like a champ mind you this was many versions ago and it functioned perfectly even then now with the upgrades and enhancements it is even easier to use spend the time toyour data completely and properly and the dividends are immediate highly recommended,59,190
1669,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks just keeps getting better and better i have been a user of intuits initial product quicken and grown along with intuit to my current version of quickbooks for mac 2010 their software development team through quickbooks for mac 2010 has taken the drudgery out of the day-to-day bookkeeping chores and transformed it into a quick and seamless part of the business it is very intuitive everything you have always wanted to know about real estate but were afraid to ask real estate for the rest of us,86,191
1670,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i have been a quickbooks user for years on the pc but love my mac and it is dependability intuit has finally gotten the mac version on par with the windows version and i use it daily best part is that this is not just a port of the windows version it is a completely mac product and utilizes the osx interface simply wonderful,62,192
1671,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quickbooks mac makes running your daily business so easy you can focus on what really matters your own customers,20,193
1672,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,as a new quickbooks for mac 2011 user who is unfamiliar with business accounting software i find littlesquares online videos helpful and shelly king and the staff there remarkably gracious and thoughtful in response to my questions and needs once I have worked longer with quickbooks i know I shall have more questions and am confident of a helpful rapid response from the team at intuits littlesquare,65,194
1673,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,using quickbooks on my mac adds all the advantages of the best operating system with the number small business accounting program,21,195
1674,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,there has no import feature maybe if you had the mac version still running you could do an export if you are lucky but you cannotthe data why do they even call these things versions of the same software,39,196
1675,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks is a great application the downside is that you must purchase updates with little or no added value every 2 - 3 years to stay in a position of product support this upgrade should have been valued at about 2995 for current quickbooks users,43,197
1676,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i have been very disappointed with this product at first i could not even transfer my pc files over to it my husband did an internet search for help and finally ended up calling the company for help they walked him through a very lengthy tedious process of transferring the files i had four companies files that i wanted to two of the transfers worked two did not then when i looked at one of the companies whose transfers worked i found that none of my memorized reports had been saved it looks like i will only be able to use quickbooks on the old pc that i saved if i want to access the information because it certainly is not available to me on the mac,126,198
1677,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,after getting a new mac i was forced to upgrade from quickbooks 2007 to quickbooks 2011 and found that there has no improvement at all i had no choice about the upgrade since the program stopped working due to compatibility issues i am very unhappy with quickbooks and it is product for mac users if you have access to a pc get the pc version,63,199
1678,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,because i am at work i can not get into all the details as i am trying to figure out why my memorized transactions are not automatically entering i worked with the pc version for years and it was very user friendly i was excited to switch to a mac and have had no problems adjusting to mac software for other products such as microsoft office too many quirks in the mac version would not recommend a couple of other examples as why you should not switch to mac version-printed reconciliations do not fit on one page had an it guy from a large corporation we are an agency of and he could not fix no answers from intuit have to relearn several processes was eventually able to figure out some items by posting in intuit community the help in quickbooks is practically useless,142,200
1679,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,two things i will not use it after importing from other software you lose information secondly it is so hard to customize a form for something in that price range you would hope they put more effort into it it looks like the people at quickbooks do not have any mac experts on their payroll they need to see the light mac is transforming the new computing era get used to it quick,69,201
1680,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i purchased mac 2011 with high hopes from pc version it is completely different and missing reports and audit features also you must type in amounts for vendor on invoices items with 2 or more lines disappear on screen but print ok you can not use qb invoice mailing service on mac why bank reconcile is much harder,58,202
1681,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i would not buy into this product i am being forced to buy the new version which i do not want as the old version which was working fine suddenly requires a new registration that does not work in snow leopard the upgrade is 199 when i can buy the full copy for 180 they have got you by the at and they know it,62,203
1682,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 is the worst ever less than 2 hours after installing it it has corrupted the file and support is terrible once i contacted quicken as instructed by the program they told me that can fix the problem they apparently knew about it but they charge between 250 and 750 to do so or you can purchase the support option for 20 month this is black mail pure and simple intuit really dropped the ball on the mac do not bother,81,204
1683,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,intuit claims a 60 day no questions asked refund but no matter what i have tried i can not get my money back now I shall have to go through my credit card company i will never ever by any intuit product again for the rest of my life,48,205
1684,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,after starting a small business with our daughter last year i became the one responsible for the books and i used qb for the first time after some suggestions from our tax accountant i found it to be an extremely useful program as my daughter has a mac i bought a new mac and have switched to the new qb so i can teach her to do her own books and i candown,75,206
1685,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i had used quicken for years but after upgrading my mac quicken data did not successfully make the change was more or less forced to try quickbooks 2011 for mac i am very pleased so far unlike my previous encounters with pc-type applications quickbooks is significantly easier to learn i am not a professional bookkeeper so my use of all the features will probably be limited the features i have used so far have been interesting and surprisingly fun so far so good,83,207
1686,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i purchased the 2011 quickbooks for mac so i can finally get my finances organized there is a bit of learning involved however i feel good about taking control and making paying bills working my budget and filing my taxes easier,41,208
1687,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,i bought this for my solo law practice and I am very disappointed i am fairly proficient on the computer but this program is not intuitive despite the brand name and too difficult even for me there has not enough flexibility to make simple accounting records the help menu does not work half the time and when it does it just sends you to random online articles i would be better off just using excel,72,209
1688,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,since upgrading to this qb version my start up time is triple what it was and my computer seems to be much more quirky do not buy it,27,210
1689,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i keep hoping that updates will fix old problems with quickbooks software for the macintosh and they do not i overpaid even at amazon for a really poor product that has a stranglehold on the accounting industry i feel forced to pay for and use this buggy software,47,211
1690,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,do not purchase this product if you plan to manually enter in your payroll it does not have the capabilities you must purchase intuits online payroll service to use payroll this is not optional read the fine print,37,212
1691,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 multi user mac should not be on the market user sessions connected the server fail to log out properly and no new data can be saved to the company files i paid extra for data services and have sent my files in repeatedly and the returned files preform no better i have been hung up on by tier 2 support and data services tells me it is not their problem customer support will not offer a refund or credit towards converting back to windows not what i wanted to do i signed up to be a beta tested and got no reply i paid for the software and get no support be warned,113,213

1693,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,quickbooks 2011 for mac disc did not work on my machine i had to contact quickbooks to download the web version the disc looked used and scratced it was supposed to be new,33,215
1694,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i had talked to quckbooks about their software for mac and was assured that it was just like the pc version i then found out that it does not have payroll you have to do that online and pay a lot for that service was also very unhappy with amazon because i was told that i could not have a refund so I am stuck with software that i can not use another thing that i was not happy with on intuit was that they use india or some over seas vendor for support i spent over 8 hours on the phone with them just trying to get my files moved from pc to mac and they still could not do it,120,216
1695,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,am returning after all the bad comments on mac quickbooks 2011 stability and support problems along with forced upgrades and planned obsolesence perception that intuit is not committed to mac version of quickbooks and reading too many negative reviews to have a good comfort level with the product,48,217
1696,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,watch out do not let the name deceive you although quickbooks is a wonderful package on the pc this mac version is awful especially considering the price if it were selling for 75 less i would still slam it but at the price offered here and everywhere it is an embarrassment the worst part for me was the difficulty in money account transfers what has the deal here i had software from the 1990s that could do this efficiently the pc version does not have any problem with it,85,218
1697,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,i need a replacement for my microsoft money for our family finances but this program is a serious bookkeeping program much too detailed for us so i returned it,29,219
1698,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i bought this for my daughter and she got it thought it was great only to find out her bank did not support it make sure you contact your bank before you purchase this software we had to reluctantly return it amazons return policy is only 50 on software that has been opened but they honored the quickbooks full refund after i contacted them or at least they said they would-i am waiting to see,75,220
1699,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,with my quicken i was able to keep track of personal and business expenses unfortunately with quickbooks it will only handle the business expenses quicken was very helpful with reminders about bills coming up and it would give me a warning that i could set of 3 to 5 days ahead of time with quickbooks we can only record the business expenses and track them in order to enter a bill i need to go to the vendors and put in the names and mailing addresses and is set up to print checks and more right now I am not sure if i want to go that way the the conversion from the pc quicken 2 the mac quickbooks was not that smooth most of the all of the vendors and payees that i had never came over as vendors they came over as other for now I shall need to be working both systems so i can close out 2010 taxes and hopefully by 2011 will have an alternative to handle the personal to track the utilities and more and when bills are popping up maybe somewhere in i-work,186,221
1700,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,I am a mac user and I have been using quickbooks for many years and still do unfortunately every time i use quickbooks i have to switch over to pc in bootcamp in canada only the pc version exists there is no mac version even after many years of requests to intuit there is a us mac version why not a canadian one intuit how difficult can it be to add small things like gst pst and hst to the tax lines as a programmer i know it does not take much to do this once i find an alternative that works on the mac that includes payroll we will switch,107,222
1701,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,having been fortunate to be a beta tester for intuit for the last several years i get to see the raw software before it get released on the street intuit does a great job of incorporating any suggestions that the beta testers provide i have been using quickbooks for 10 plus years to manage my commercial properties having used a pc for 8 - 1/2 years before buying a macbook i was reluctant to migrate my qb file over to a mac version of quickbooks for fear of losing data in the transition i had been using vmware to run quickbooks 2010 in a windows environment on macbook until i installed the release version of quockbooks 2011 for the mac the transition worked perfectly and i have had no problems since intuit did a great job with quickbooks 2011 for the mac to capatilize on the unique features of the mac os,150,223
1702,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,all i want is a webconnector for mac to allow 3rd party integration with qb i was told it would be available soon two years ago surprise on the inuit web site they still say it will be available soon in the forums if you are going to release a product for the mac you need to make it at least as strong or close as the pc verison the ui in the demo is better but still lacking however i still think the programmers are approaching the product from a pc and/or engineer point of view the user experience and the lack of full features make this upgrade hardly worthwhile recommendation wait intuit should not be rewarded for this upgrade,119,224
1703,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,tried to convert from qb pro for windows 2009 to qb for mac 2011 failed even with qb tech supports help followed all the steps the mac version would not accept the same password as the pc version after 30 mins on the phone to tech support in india they told me the only way to migrate would be to remove the password and that i could not do that because i was using cc processing so they would need to conference in the cc processing guys to help me remove my password in the transfer my line got dropped went dead do you ever get the feeling that can i transfer you oh sorry the call got dropped is a standard way for some tech support operations to get customers they can not help off the line the tech support person had taken my number but no-one tried to call me back bottom line i am faced with the choice of keeping a 10 year old pc just to run qb getting a new one just to run it or most likely finding a different product that can do my not complex book-keeping on the mac seems that intuits neglect of mac users is real,204,225
1704,Software,B003YJ8WFE,1.0,negative,i purchased this product from jon saul do not purchase from him this product does not come with a registration code and has limited uses of 15 times the product is perfect for what my intended use was however i can not use it because it was not complete with registration code,51,226
1705,Software,B003YJ8WFE,4.0,positive,i think it worked better than the 2014 version,9,227
1706,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,quickbooks is the standard right so i followed the crowd and upgraded every couple of years despite the they want how much expense the only problem is that the every version is worse it is more confusing does less that is obvious and easy for someone whose skills are not in accounting and the mac version never did want to sync with my bank or credit cards the end result is that i used it as little as possible and thus my small business accounting data was perpetually out of date when i started my new solo company i signed up with freshbooks instead it updates things immediately it stays as simple as i need and the data is up-to-date without a lot of effort see ya quickbooks i will not miss you,130,228
1707,Software,B003YJ8WFE,5.0,positive,quick and easy software to help small business owners keep track of their expenses while you do not need to have formal accounting training in order to use this program it probably would not hurt to have access to a real accountant if you are completely without experience we thought we were doing a good job our first year until it was tax time and our cpa made us aware of possible problems / issues that needed to be resolved by no means a result of the software having been faulty just improper use / understanding of it is use on our end it took a good couple of weekends for us to get everything straightened out and we did end up hiring an accountant for a few hours just to help give us some guidance and direction moving forward still use quickbooks to date and satisfied with it,141,229
1708,Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,poor interface with pc products such that when our office changed over to a pc-system we lost all our accounting,20,230

1715,Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,i bought it mainly for the trust software only to find out that it was for windows xp whereas the willmaker could be used with windows 7 which i have therefore it was a waste of money for me,39,4

1723,Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i bought this program a couple of months ago and just installed it when i registered the program i was informed that it is no longer supported and that i can get the update by paying for a new program at a discount i bought the program because the description implies that it contains all the common forms needed for the average person first thing i tried to do was a general power of attorney it is not in the program this seems to be the modern standard of conduct for so many businesses today devious and deceptive i wasted my money on this program be sure you read all the descriptions before you buy and find that you have been sucker-punched,124,12
1724,Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i have not had the opportunity to examine all of the software in this package deal from quicken i bought this primarily interested in the living trust maker that comes bundled in this package after successfully installing the willmaker premium 2012 software onto my vista machine i put the living trust maker disk in my pc but i did not get the welcome screen that should appear automatically therefore i followed the instructions that were given on the disk and on the nolo quicken web site when you run into this issue apparently i am not the first i wento to start accessories run and entered d autorun but nothing happened i also tried e autorun and f autorun to no avail i went to the nolo quicken support site for further assistance but found none i am just a bit frustrated i guess i will have to see if there is a quicken technical phone number that i can call for further assistance i will come back and revise this review should i have success installing the disk and after i have had the opportunity to use the software,185,13
1725,Software,B004DLCQZ4,1.0,negative,i actually purchased the 2012 version of this product from costco and it is a junk i used to have a 2004 version that did a joint living trust for me and thinking it is time for me to update the software after i install the software i found out it only supports a basic living trust for single people not married couple when it detects my old living trust file it told me to go back to 2004 version for any change on living trust can you believe this what kind of company do this i was hoping this new version will give me more feature than my 2004 version but it actually supports less than the old one i am very upset i stick with this software instead of purchasing another cheaper software like willcreator deluxe that let us you create joint living trust i will not buy another single software from this company ever do not waste your money if you are married,166,14
1726,Software,B004DLCQZ4,2.0,negative,i bought this so i could update our wills living wills and power of attorneys so far it looks like it leads you to sites where you can purchase these documents maybe I am just doing this wrong but i still have no new will,45,15

1738,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the worst product i have ever bought from amazon i do not recommend it to anybody if you have 30 to waste then you will have more fun burning it than spending on instant immersion software the software looks like it was designed 15 years ago and the jerks at instant immersion have not updated it in 15 years do not buy this crap i tried to install it on my mac and the stupid thing does not install like most other softwares the instructions are pathetic i wish the bozos at amazon would not sell this product i hate it and has setback my learning by several months,109,2

1743,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i finally got around to trying this product and it is subpar could not understand the man dictating the words which means quality of the dvds is bad i then went to return to sender and i have passed the window of opportunity darn it wasted money,48,7

1766,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the software is slow and i am working on a mac less than a year old it continually stops working and shuts down unless i received a lemon this software is worth less than the cheap price i paid,39,30
1767,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,yo no se nada que paso amigo the disks are very good and i will be using them more often,20,31
1768,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,purchased for my father who is 80 years old the newest version of the software that i purchased elsewhere would not work on his older mac operating system but this one did and he loves it,35,32
1769,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i bought this to brush up on my spanish which really needs a major overhaul great for learning and plays on your pc,23,33
1770,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,not sure where i went wrong but this was not what i thought i was order i did not send it back and it is okay but i do not use it as much i think i will eventually purchase something else but it was not what i thought i was ordering,47,34
1771,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,it work really well the shipping was fast this is exactly what i was looking for I am hoping to see how my son can learn spanish,27,35
1772,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i bought this program at costco my computer does not have a dvd drive so i downloaded the software i think i did but i guess i will not find out because when i attempted to activate the program it will not accept it is own key guess it will be going back to costco from this idiocy to reading these reviews after the fact i guess i should not have bought the program in the first place,73,36
1773,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this review may be a little premature since i have only used it once so far but i am very impressed i have used the rosetta version and love it but lost the cd so could not reload the program after i got rid of my old computer i did not want to pay that price again so decided to try this one it works wonderful and is fun to use one disappointment and i knew this before i chose to buy it is that this is spain spanish and not the latin america that we are more used to in the states,103,37
1774,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is so frustrating i have a macbook air and so i am spoiled and am not used to having programs crash i have not gotten past the third screen to see if the learning program is good or not seriously so aggravating,43,38
1775,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a great way to get started with a new language i use the cd at i go to and from work that keeps the words fresh in my mind the repetition of going through the cd multiple times also helps in retaining conjugation info which is the most difficult for me to retain the lessons on the dvd are very good and allow you to go at your own pace and repeat as needed,76,39
1776,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,my computer whiz son-in-law had trouble loading this program for my granddaughter we were all disappointed that it was not a bid more user friendly,24,40
1777,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this was a great holiday gift for my wife as she has always saying what an awful teacher i have been great for the price and easy to follow,28,41
1778,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,some fun games and stuff you would do much better downloading a language app on your phone or even better making friends with spanish speakers the best way to learn is to immerse yourself listen to spanish music watch spanish tv and go visit and make friends with latinos they will warmly welcome you and be glad to help a gringo out,62,42
1779,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i bought this for my son at christmas it is a very well put together program it beats the leader by a country mile for a fraction of the cost highly recommended,31,43
1780,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product is terrible do not buy it is decent only for a review of certain vocabulary words but would not actually aid in teaching one how to speak spanish i bought it because it seemed like a great purchase for the price i guess you get what you pay for,50,44
1781,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,this application requires that my machine have a cd rom dvd drive i have a usb cd rom drive but the application does not install on my laptop it runs directly from the cd rom can you say 1995 i have nohow good an application this is yet but i do know that if a cd rom is required every time i run it that i will not use it so in case publishers have not heard most mainstream laptops do not have built in cd rom drives anymore requiring a drive to install is understandable requiring a drive to run the app is not ok and has not been for several years now,117,45
1782,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,not that great simple and probably not what i would recommend to any one else wanting to pick up the language quick,22,46
1783,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,full of grammar explaination makes listener get bored and could not follow from the first 15min too much grammar for a cd language,22,47

1785,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,bought this program to learn spanish it give you a lot of material at the fraction of what rosetta stone charges the only problem i have with so much material to use is where to start for others this might not be a problem there are suggestions but not real lesson plans to follow i like it when tell you where to start and walk you through the course to the very end not a deal killer but something i personally would like all in all very impressed with the quality and quantity of this package,96,49

1787,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,so far i like this it is easy to use and compliments my introductory to spanish class i would reccommend this for beginners it is well worth the money it is colorful and gives you picyures to guide you along the way,39,51
1788,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this product has been really helpful couple of notes 1 it is spain spanish so be careful with pronunciation and 2 the layout reminds me of old 90s cd-roms it works and it really helps it not flashy and I am okay with that,42,52
1789,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this is awesome if you do not have that much time for studying like all learning cds it takes the commitment of the buyer and i do not have that if you are bent on learning although this is perfect and it does not burn your pockets like other learning materials do,49,53
1790,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,great couple of games to help learning but cumbersome toon a mobile device would recommend more games to aid in learning,23,54
1791,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,as with every other discipline there has no magic pill that being said there is so much to choose from in this package that if you are willing to put the time and effort in it is a great program,38,55

1794,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,not at all intimidating and super easy to work with I am learning spanish side by side with my eight-year-old daughter so this really is for everyone we love the well done announcements when we get things right I am now motivated to buy the french version,45,58
1795,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is nothing like rosestta stone as it claims much harder to follow and use i was very very disappointed with this product wish i would have never sent back my rosetta stone when i seen this product claiming to be as good for a whole lot less money but now i know why it sucks,56,59
1796,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,was not what i expected it does not deliver extremely repetitive and the graphics on this is that of a childrens game from the 1990s i was so disappointed in this program,32,60
1797,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,have not used it yet so it is hard to review at this moment but i will get to it once i use it,23,61
1798,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,came out of the gate with great intentions but just not my type of learning i guess might work better for others,22,62
1799,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,I am from south florida and am around spanish all the time so i just need more vocabulary and small sentence practice to get by i got the 16 cd course for your car the first 8 cds were pretty good then you heard spanish people in different conversations i got nothing out of the last 8 cds the speakers spoke so fast i could only understand a few words in each sentence to their credit they did they did repeat the sentences but this approach did nothing for me i listened to the entire course 3 times and still could not understand the speakers what made it worse was that they spoke the sentence very slowly in english but then said it so fast in spanish that it actually makes you angry that they do it this way,138,63
1800,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,this is basically usesless and not worth the 20 bucks i tried it for about 10 minutes go for rosetta stone just spend the money it is worth it,28,64
1801,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,after reading the reviews i dove in i only got to play with the games / vocab level one for a couple hours one day and could not believe how much of it i was remembering a couple weeks later still got a long ways to go but this is going to help with the vocabulary building for sure,56,65
1802,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i am very happy with this product i do not do the work needed but do listen to it often while driving and have improved my knowledge of spanish,29,66

1805,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this software package is very easy to use and offers ample opportunities to practice the language as long as it is used often just as with any language learning package you will see your spanish improve steadily you should supplement it with a book that teachers grammar as well i recommend see it and say it in spanish,58,69
1806,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i chose this product because of the price and the guarantee of how easy it was to learn so far I am very pleased with the product,26,70
1807,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i ordered this software program hoping that i would learn spanish to supplement my teaching career unfortunately disk 1 did not work at all i followed the instructions how to download included with the software and neither of my two computers would start it i even followed the auto play instructions included with the software but alas it would not start i tried other cds on both of my computers to make sure it was not a computer problem and those cds worked fine i tried the game disk and it started but there were no clear instructions how make the game go and i gave up i sent this product back and will try a different program,117,71

1815,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i had read numerous reviews on this program before i bought it i have had some formal training in the spanish language for work i bought this package for the pure fact of listing to the cds while i am driving to work i have only listed to the first half or about 10 cds i have not utilized the dvds nor the second half however i wanted to let you know that you either need to write down the vocabulary and verbs so you can learn the words and listen to the cd again or this package is great for a person that already has an understanding of the spanish language i think you get a lot of verb conjugation and word usage for the money out of this package and very easy to understand good luck,138,79
1816,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is an easy to use program updates are easy to install and it is a pretty simple program to use,20,80
1817,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,does everything an individual needs for a spanish language language program a fraction of a price of roseta stone great for high school spanish,24,81
1818,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,the cds provide half the work but the user still has to apply the dedication and consistency to actually learn the language the cds are laid out in a simple format to allow quick learning,35,82
1819,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i would put this product up there with rosetta stone and for the price might be even better wish there were more detailed directions on how mto get the most out of the program which is also my complaint with rosetta stone as with both you have to use them consistently for best results,54,83
1820,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,if you are just looking for a tv type game go for it otherwise a waste of money very disappointed get rosetta stone or sign up at the community college,29,84
1821,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,cartoonish and not in a good way i can not imagine learning spanish with this this is a waste of money,20,85
1822,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i was sceptical at first but this package definitely helped me improve my spanish still a long way to go but i feel like i got quite far without struggling the box looked a bit cheesy but I am glad i gave it a try had a little trouble working it out at first but worth sticking with,57,86
1823,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,designed to look like rosetta stone but when you receive it clearly it is not the print in the description is so small that is its difficult to discern this fact i suspect this was purposely done to dupe the unwitting amazon will accept it is return but only after i paid the shipping back do not be fooled,56,87
1824,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,there are separate program levels hours of audio content printable picture dictionaries interactive dvd that plays on tb using remote control average retail price 49 there are 4 dvds spanish levels 1 2 and 3 spanish audio deluxe mp3 spanish interactive dvd a spanish cd-rom game level 1 teaches the essential level 2 teaches more complex phases level 3 teaches you more complex phases to learn the language installation instructions are easy you can program you ipad to teach you,80,88
1825,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this did not work like we had thought it would be very basic and we did not learn a thing before we were frustrated and bored sorry but there are better products out there,34,89
1826,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i liked this series but i did not get a chance to really enjoy this product i will once i return back to the united states again,27,90
1827,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,instant immersion presents the spanish language in an easy-to-learn manner the games reinforce the lessons students must achieve a certain number of points before going on to the next level my 10-year-old granddaughter loves it and has caught on quickly she did think it was funny that two of the words taught on level 1 are wine and beer but overall i feel teaches a wide variety of common words and phrases I have never tried rosetta stone but instant immersion is way less expensive the set of levels 1 - 3 cost me 30,92,91
1828,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,instant immersion powered by eurotalk spanish levels 1 2 and 3 did not work very well on my mac desktop the discs were freezing and many files refused to open i used this on my main desktop an imac 24 ghz intel core 2 duo os x version 1082 i would not recommend this software if you are planning to use it on a mac i did not bother to try it on a pc pcs frustrate me enough so i am certain that software can not teach me a language on one,90,92
1829,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i sent this to my daughter she reports it was recieved in a timely mannor and is proving to be helpful,21,93

1831,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this was a really good buy you can not go wrong for what it costs you will not feel like you have wasted your money if you are not a real devoted learner we just wanted something we could use when we have the time and ambition even if we only pick up a few common words and phrases it is still worth it if you are more motivated this will keep you going adios,70,95
1832,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,decent exercises but the vocab is random that is my only gripe because it should follow more set categories like textbooks if you are just looking for a supplementary lesson then this is great and definitely worth the 380 or so you save from rosetta stone,44,96
1833,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,the program is well presented it covers the language subject very well it is easy to use and east to understand,21,97
1834,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this was the first product i bought to learn spanish i did no research and saw the cheap price and went for it i tried it and it has very limited material zero grammer rules just phrases and translation that you memorize maybe ok to learn a few phrases but you can find more just online or youtube if anybody is serious about learning spanish identification buy learning spanish like crazy or fsi and professor jason on youtube and if just a couple phrases is what your looking for any youtube spanish channel or phrase book is better also this is spain spanish an I have been focusing on south american spanish,111,98
1835,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i think this was a great product to use whether you are a child or an adult you need to put your all into this program and you will walk away with your goal achieved,35,99
1836,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,my wife and i speak some spanish this has really helped us especially when you are traveling overseas i highly recommend this over the other more expensive program,27,100
1837,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i wanted a fast way to learn enough spanish to use on my trip to spain this is the best way to pick and choose the things you really want to know the focus is easyto follow i would recommend this product to everyone,44,101
1838,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,totally not anything like what rosetta stone has thought this would be just like that if not a little easier,20,102
1839,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the program might be ok but my imac and it did not agree took forever to prepare for operation and then quit suddenly and repeatedly really could not use it,29,103
1840,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i was surprised at the number of interactive dvd s in this set for the price this is a very good buy,22,104
1841,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,a real waste if money there should be some type of manuel to help you with the program i tried to place this in itunes and it would not work this should be very intuitive to use and it is not i hope rosette stone is better,45,105
1842,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this made a great addition to the classes my sister was taking and she was able to ace her test my sons are now listening to this daily i recommend this to everyone I am up next to improve my spanish,40,106
1843,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,great value for a 4 packs filled with cds for the car to listen too and excellent dvds for the computer to see the written words and to practice the langauge with the microphone,34,107
1844,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i just got it and whenever i start the first dvd 1 the programe quite by itself i am really disappointed and i do not recommend it to any one i think i will get rosseta stone,37,108
1845,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,really not very good product nice chart showing how it compares and says even more benefits than rosetta stone but wow this is a very slow non-intriguing software reminds of software from early days of computers worse it seems about two steps ahead of the old cassette learning systems yellow packaging is nice i give credit to their marketing team i hope rosetta is not like this,67,109
1846,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,the gift recipient lady likes it very much and is busy at it especially it also seems toto the continental spanish-castillian version,24,110
1847,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i could not wait to recieve this i bypassed my ipod and uploaded it to my amazon cloud this way i can access it anywhere we travel to a spanish speaking country usually every year and I have found this very useful as other reviewers have said it does require that you listen and do the work i do not have any experience with rosetta stone so i can not compare it to that but i can not find any fault with instant immersion spanish,82,111
1848,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,great value i bought thisfor my son to help with spanish class i am excited about the material and he finds it interesting i am sure he will do better with this awesome tool,36,112

1852,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,have no clue havnet tried it yet bought it for husband for christmas so he can try somthing different while otr trucking,22,116
1853,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,depending on your needs you can begin learning words or phrases immediately the tapes are broken into several categories to help get you started immediately they also incorporate a listening component so that you will learn to say the words accurately,41,117
1854,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,pretty good tutorial but better if you have had some exposure to the language before the games are silly but engaging,20,118
1855,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i my opinion this program is worthless compared to rossetta stone it is a joke the first lessons gave me no help at all,24,119

1858,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this is an unbelievable tool for learning spanish it is easy and fun and way cheaper than rosetta stone i highly recommend it,22,122
1859,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i was under the impression this would be similar to the rosetta stone series just at a much more affodable price i was wrong I have only gotten half way through the first disc and it is ok,37,123
1860,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i got this for my son who wanted software for learning spanish i speak spanish fluently as well as english this software is crapware if you want something to help you learn spanish look elsewhere my son after checking it out has never used it further and i do not blame him,51,124
1861,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am learning spanish with this program the choices and different media are very helpful i would recomend using this program,21,125
1862,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,it has been said that if you know only one language you do not know that language this wonderful set of learning discs presents a great learning opportunity in an enjoyable format for learning at your own pace in your home if you want learn another language easily this is a great opportunity,52,126

1864,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,should be false advertising to compare this to the rosetta stone spanish this has poor audio and the graphics and games are not any better very disappointed,27,128
1865,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,have not got to use it yet but is as i expected it to be i have not used it so i can not comment further,24,129
1866,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i purchased this to start learning conversational spanish it is no where near the depth that i was hoping for or that would prove useful in fact most of what i reviewed here i learned in high school spanish 101 it was a good review although w / basics liketravel-related words and more if you need a brief overview of the very very basic words needed to converse then this could work if you are really looking to learn the language then skip it,83,130
1867,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am not a native speaker of spanish so i ordered this and I have played with it once i was able to figure it out i found it to be very simple and easy to use it covers a lot of words and grammar and it offers a way of learning a lot of the basics that for me is very easy it is simple to just click it on play with the software for 20 a day i need a lot more review than many folks so repetition has been necessary for me i like it there are other spanish language packages i do not know how this compares to the others I had give it a b and recommend it to others,122,131
1868,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this was a gift to my grandson he worked with spanish speaking people and wanted to learn conversational spanish i can not evaluate this product,24,132
1869,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i am so glad i chose this program to learn spanish i had purchased other programs and had only learned a few words from them the instant immersion spanish proved to be the one that has taught me spanish i feel confident i can carry on some conversations and not feel lost when someone asks me a question in spanish,60,133
1870,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product feels like it was designed for a different era a time when people used to purchase encyclopedias on cd-rom i found the entire program cumbersome and annoying to use in terms of content i feel that there are free alternatives out there that will give you the same benefit this product is not an introduction to the language it is a tool for learning how to ask for the bathroom and how to order a beer you would be better off with a small book or an ios application that performs the same function,96,134
1871,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,hi i did enjoy the cd s but shipping was as much as the product and some of the cd s are not workingthe speaking is wrong at times like no como carne is not how you say i don t eat meatnow is this mexican spanish or spain spanish i don t know what is wrong and what is right i just keep practising i do wish to purchase 4 and 5 but they are so expensive i don t think i will i all i do think your product is good and well packaged thank youmike,90,135
1872,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,it seems increasingly important for many individuals to become more familiar with the spanish language after all everyone from the border of mexico down to the tip of south america speaks it there are more spanish speakers in the western hemisphere than english speakers so what is the best way to learn spanish by instant immersion you will learn quickly with the incredible amount of content in this program this is a wonderful course with many different learning methods for you to benefit from if one method does not work try another people learn in different ways so having options in a learning program is very helpful there is always the 6 month guarantee if you do not like the program return it for a refund how can you lose,129,136
1873,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,is this a joke how do i learn from this you are throwing 20 words at me and expect me to learn the no 1 thing in learning a new language is repetition yes that means i should look over the flash cards on my own but i can do that on my own without the software i want the software to help me with this and make it enjoyable how can anyone compare this to rosetta stone you get what you pay for,83,137
1874,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i can not say how bad i found this to be it would not even downfrom the internet the only thing i learned was not to buy anything else from instant immersion,36,138
1875,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,a good low cost alternative to rosetta i downloaded the mp3 audio portion to my smartphone and listen to it back and forth to work i found it helped me more than the computer program in the program both the male and female shake their heads and their lips say yes when you get a right answer but the audio says si would have been so hard to record them actually saying si,73,139
1876,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a pretty good learn spanish program it includes a software with six different learning programs on it an mp3 cd i ripped onto my computer then put on my mp3 player a dvd it is more like the second lesson set on the software cd and a game to test you overall it is not bad for a software under 30 if you take full advantage of all the discs i believe you should be very pleased my only complaint would be the case the cds are all stacked upon one another in a plastic case they are also very difficult to get out or at least on my set do not know if everyone is the same so i just grabbed a bunch of empty cd cases i had lying around and put them in there other than the case i do not really have any complaints about this program,148,140
1877,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this software is a joke not only is all the content available on itunes or online for free but the interface and quality is near non-existent i could not run 90 of the program due to getting an error message that my screen resolution was not high enough despite that fact that the resolution on my hd monitor was far in excess of the requirements in addition the mp3 download would notto my iphone an iphone mind you that has zero problems with any other file or software the flashcards worked that is it they were pitiful to say the least terrible art with strange inclusions and omissions i am fairly confident that nobody needs to learn the word for hippopotamus before say book or television or door or house and more not worth 5 let alone 30 if i could give it zero stars i would,140,141
1878,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is quite possibly the worst language program i have ever attempted to use if i could give it zero stars i would i constantly receive error messages despite the fact that i downloaded a patch so it works with my operating system it quits frequently the design is poor it is not worth even 28 no matter how much more expensive rosetta stone is no one should ever dream of substituting this crappy program for that anything is better than this,82,142
1879,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,wow ok i admit that my comparison of online / digital language courses is being compared to rosetta stone but as an educator in general this program is awful they teach you words at random not in word sets verbs are non existent in the beginning phases and the voices and illustrations not photos are boring very elementary in drawing style for 30 you are paying them tp package and ship this junk to you not to learn a language if you are looking to truly learn a language in a natural tested setting online / digitally i would strongly recommend the rosetta stone series i learned more in an hour trial version of rosetta stone than in an excruciating hour of this one this product is very much not recommended for beginners or for anyone who wants to learn spanish or any other language,141,143
1880,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i listen to the lessons in my car wonderful instruction i wish they had a intermediate version worth every penny,20,144
1881,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,designed primarily for beginners despite the claims for intermediate and advanced the talk-back feature does not give you enough time to say what is required and there is no way to adjust this some of the vocabulary is bizzare who needs to know the spanish for zoo animals some of the quiz questions focus on spelling which seems fairly irrelevant to most visitors some quality issues with the cds themselves plus this is european spanish not latin american so lots of lisping involved,83,145
1882,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,if you have been wanting to learn spanish but not sure you should she shall out for rosetta stone this product makes a nice alternative it is not a comprehensive guide to learning the language there has no attempts really to teach grammar or to build a fluency in the language it does however teach a great deal of conversational spanish that you could put to use in real-life situations one thing to note this product teaches spanish with a catalan accent the kind of spanish spoken in spain it is slightly different from the mexican spanish you might be more familiar with,99,146
1883,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,being perceptually impaired learning anything new for me is always a challenge being in the lower income bracket limits my choices of available products to learn from instant immersion accommodates for both without leaving me feeling like i spent too much or overwhelmedinstant immersion spanish levels 1 2 and 3,53,147
1884,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the speaking portion of rosetta stone is overall very good sometimes the feedback to the speaker is frustrating in that it is very picky and arbitrary however i would never use rosetta stone again unless the parent / teacher speaks and writes spanish fluently the student has no chance to learn how to correctly write or speak spanish rosetta stone does not teach grammar they hope the student will learn it through immersion immersion only teaching may work pretty good in very young children but has it is limitations as we age at the very least it would be helpful if they would provide the keys to the worksheets and tests with the answers translated in english,114,148
1885,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i did not find this product easy to use and not very happy with it wishing i had ordered rosetta stone instead you get what you pay for in this case unhappy customer,31,149
1886,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i had a few years of spanish as a teen and speak italian so i got this as a review before going to guatemala for an acupuncture clinical visit it did help me remember spanish but you should know that it focuses on castillan spanish rather than south and central american spanish i am not particularly game oriented but games are used as drills the recording of your own voice really helps in comparing accents at least provided it has the accent that you are going for paired with outreach spanish with audio compact discs the program helped me prepare and at less cost than with the rosetta stone,111,150
1887,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i used to recommend instant immersion to everyone but not any more I have used instant immersion deluxe 20 in the past and it was great much better than rosetta stone at a fraction of the price but this is a completely different product apparently they have bought out eurotalk slapped the instant immersion label on it and discontinued what had been very good language-learning software this is just audio flash cards no grammar no evaluation of your pronunciation although it does let you record yourself and listen to yourself for people who for some reason can not hear their own voices but can hear a speaker on top of that it does not work on windows 7 even although the box says it does i contacted the company and they suggested running in xp compatibility mode furthermore i had contacted the publisher before i bought this product and was assured it was latin american spanish it is not it is cathhhtilian and now the publisher is telling me it is not even available in latin american version which means they lied to me the last time,182,151
1888,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i bought a few different languages from instant immersion much better than the other compnay great visual love the games and the lessons are easy to follow got to have it if enjoy learning a new language you need this for your next adventure in the world,46,152
1889,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this has helped a struggling spanish student tremendously 40 minutes in class a couple of times a week and studying the textbook just was not enough instant immersion was the answer we are very thankful for this software using it for one quarter raised the student 3 grades thank you,49,153
1890,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,was going to purchase rosetta stone so glad i did not spend the money the instant immersion was the way to go after i read the reviews i decided to purchase this program is amazing i have learned more spanish in a week than i ever thought i would do not just think about getting this program just do it this is a fun easy way to learn spanish so glad i found it,73,154
1891,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this product does not work on mac osx lion even visited and downloaded patch from support site just does not work sent product back within 20 mins of receiving it,30,155
1892,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,even after downloading a patch available on eurotalkcom the cd will not play correctly on my imac when starting the first exercise i keep receiving an error message super talk error number 13 long integer expected but found something else,40,156
1893,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i ordered instant immersion spanish because it had levels i ii and iii and the promotion compared the product to rosetta stone at a much lower price i thought i could advance quickly to the levels ii and iii with my current knowledge of spanish with this product but it was not for me it does not come anywhere close to rosetta stone which i have seen but have not purchased first it is very basic start to finish and not well done as a language instruction package second the quality of the presentation and organization is very poor and cryptic that is put together cheaply it seems like the videos lessons are out of the 1990s third it does not run smoothly on windows 7 for some reason a little jumpy in the videos yes it is cheap but you get what you pay for in this product and i would not recommend it if you know any spanish at all do not waste your money consider other options which is what i am doing now at an intermediate level,176,157
1894,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,my son used this as additional practice while he was taking required language courses over two semesters in college so it was not his only instruction more just a supplement the benefit was worth the investment of time and money he got as in both classes,46,158
1895,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,if you have wanted to learn a foreign this is a great way to start yes true it is not rosetta stone but not everyone can afford it this is a very affordable way to start learning the spanish language try it out it is affordable easy to use and very basic which to me is the way to start learning a new language basic is best you can always move onto a more expensive and extensive program like rosetta stone if you find you enjoy learning spanish and want to continue and become fluent,94,159
1896,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i grew up during a time where french was the primary language taught in schools unfortunately for me spanish is the second language that is needed most in my area of work i once looked up rosetta stone cds but they were soo expensive i nearly cried and promptly forgot about learning espanol i jumped at the chance to learn from these cds and so far so good i love the way the lessons are set up and i love that i can download lessons to listen to on my ipod this is a great way for me to learn spanish while traveling working out or just walking i am loving this language learning program and for the price it can not be beat if you want to learn spanish i would highly recommend instant immersion,135,160
1897,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,the interface for this piece of software is really poor the graphics are poor and look like they have not been updated since the 80s the audio is mediocre at best and there is no methodology or pedagogy behind this product if you can learn a language from having words and phrases thrown at you randomly then i suspect this product or any other on the market will do I am sticking to pimsleur and assimil for the time being,78,161
1898,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i can not use the application because it requires higher resolution screen I am using a netbook and the program will not download on a smaller screen so that is kind of disappointing,29,162
1899,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,it is amateur night for programmers one of their screens seems to have become my default desktop covering all my icons does not show up in task manager and no way to remove it that i can discover even when working between glitches like this it is only so-so and apparently intended for kids only,52,163
1900,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product to anyone it is very childish and i learned nothing i was expecting something a lot more sophisticated not a child level program you are better off buying something else,36,164
1901,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,while the instant immersion people compare their product to rosetta stone this is in a different class and can not really be compared head-to-head however it is so much less expensive that it is a fantastic bargain it does cover the basics and if you are going on a trip in the next few months this is the program I had use it has multiple ways to learn including puzzles and games the production quality is high and there has a lot of material that said there has no grammar manuals or other written reference materials that means that this is focused on spoken spanish if that is what you are interested in then this would be a bargain at twice the price,115,165
1902,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,disk 1 lesson 1 was very good disk 2 does not work in either of my computers i found the web page that mentions there may be a fix for the problem but after trying that the disk still does not work until this is fixed i would not recommend this program,51,166
1903,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,guest reviewer mrs know it all -b well for the money it is a good basic tool to help you learn spanish vocabulary i have worked with rosetta stone language software and do not think this is as structured of courses but for the price who can complain this software teaches you the vocabulary and phrases i did not find the advance conversation lessons to helpful as i think the samples were talking to quickly especially if you are someone just learning the language you need it to be slow some of the games were fun a little hard to figure out sometimes but overall fun i would recommend this product for someone who just wants to learn the basics in a new language and not break the bank doing it,131,167
1904,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,it arrived on time got it for my wife who deals with spanish speakers on the job she has not used it yet,22,168
1905,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,this is unquestionably the worst software i can remember purchasing in the past 25 years i put my child in front of it with a mic only to discover that it gives you no cues as to when to speak or how to accumulate points are you supposed to speak as soon as theappears and the voice announces the name or when the progress bar appears or after that who knows there is no onscreen guide it is the very model of awful software engineering,87,169
1906,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i purchased this in preparation for a trip to spain in january it is been 30 years since college and high school spanish so i really wanted to refresh my memory and get some basics in before the trip i am having so much fun with the instant immersion spanish i just started and am only at the beginning of level 1 so i can not say how it does in higher levels i love being able to go in and do word practice over and over until i get it and the review games are fun i am anxious to let my 4th 3rd and 2nd grader play along with me also i think they will also really enjoy the games,120,170
1907,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,this willon an ipod which makes it easy to use at my age learning a new language is not as easy as it is for a child but this program seems to working it is also far more affordable than the competition give it a try,48,171
1908,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,i suck at languages most of the time my english is not all that great and after taking german all throughout grades 8 - 12 i have learned that I am never going to be one of those people that can magically sound like I am speaking another language without sounding like an idiot that being said a family trip was planned for mexico and i did not want to look like a complete tourist while wandering the streets with a dumb look on my face after checking out rosetta stones website i just did not want to invest a weeks salary on learning a new language this product provided me enough to get around without bogging me down with too much information it took me a few times of doing the same exercises but i had figured it would not be an instantaneous fluency i did download the mp3s on my ipod but found myself skipping over most of the lessons and my mind wandering about a minute into listening overall this product helped me out a little bit and the price was right if you really want to become a fluent spanish speaker i do not think this is going to do it unless you are some sort of language magician,203,172
1909,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,contrary to what was advertised the product only included spanish phrases for the ipod and no lecture which are essentially useless by them selves methods of teaching worked well for the pc components but were a little 90s ish,39,173
1910,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i returned this product soon after opening the box the software seems to be a strange and confusing compilation of several different programs packed into one it runs very slowly and freezes up often i could not get the voice recording feature to work and the oscar lake game is outdated and would not run in vista i plan on saving my money and purchasing a more expensive program,69,174
1911,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,this is a decent but not mind-blowing learn-to-speak spanish software package on the positive side it gets you listening to spoken and seeing written spanish the program presents a fairly comprehensive vocabulary that should cover many situations tourists and other new speakers might find them in on the negative side the interface looks decidedly dated and some of the vocabulary might be a bit esoteric for beginners other than that for the price it is a good way to become more familiar with spanish,83,175
1912,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i although it was little to difficult for kids at the young end of the age range advertised it was delived in a timely manner and packaged well but my youngest child was lost on this software however in terms of content it was not as advanced for older kids as i thought it did not teach me anything i did not already know anyway if you are looking for something very basic that comes along with a song that sounds as if only an elevator would be appropriate going down and never stopping,94,176
1913,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,not as user friendly by my expectation but it works,10,177
1914,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,basic spanish could have learned and gotten this from online for free,12,178
1915,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,beats rosetta stone too pricey but this can work,8,179
1916,Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,it is garbage save your money and buy rosetta stone,9,180
1917,Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,my wife and i have been using this product for a couple of years now we review each time before we travel to a spanish speaking country it will really help getting you through day-to-day when out of the country,40,181
1918,Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,i used rosetta stone this is nearly as good for the price point,12,182
1919,Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,i was interested in learning to speak the language the program was easy to use but i could not stick with it boring glitchy and hard to figure out the sound difference i could hear i was not saying the words the same but had no guidance to help with the pronunciation difficulties i would not recommend this for someone like me with zero experience with the language,65,183
1920,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,this product works well unlike other reviewers i had no problems with installation or hangduring and a new computer windows 8 16 gig ram user interface is easy and intuitive and the results are acceptable this is not the highest end video processing software but it works well and is fantastic at this price point will outperform any software from 5 years ago at any price having played with various programs for about 15 years i am amazed at how my capability the new software has recommended,87,0
1921,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,the sheer number of options available can be overwhelming but stay tuned it gets better after a straightforward installation and some time spent updating the software you are presented with an intuitive interface there are a good number of resources for help in using it starting with a free 30-day installation support with registration the manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer it was not difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips most of it is just drag and drop cutting is easy moving samples around is also very easy there are a huge number of transitions effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy less is more all of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product the usual capabilities exist adding audio recording voiceovers and so on in spite of this the software is not that cumbersome on system resources importing and exporting is straightforward as well this is a solid performer that does all the basics any amateur would be satisfied with four stars,189,1
1922,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,purchased downloaded version today which turned out to be 4 executable files installation of all 4 gave back successfully installed messages upon opening pinnacle studio 17 plus software the settings defaulted to searching my hard drive automatically for all potential content to build a library from problem experienced is software has now hung on trying to build this auto library from years upon years thousands of jpegs music files video files pinnacle studio 17 plus is now inoperable and only shows the rotating circle status symbol same behavior after repeated close and restarts am unable to go into settings libraries tabs nada,102,2
1923,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,i use this software to edit a small web series there are few special effects but it does well with small things integrating a car chase and animation in my case this software is a vital tool for clarifying picture andon a budget i run windows 8 enterprise on a lenovo all-in-one and this runs smoothly without conflicting with other programs or causing issues which corel always did to me if you have simple projects that do not require a whole lot of special effects this is a good budget program and i definitely recommend it,97,3
1924,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,i already had a bad experience with pinnacle studio 17 ultimate and found it too difficult to use it is no good for anyone other than someone who has an expert video editor i decided to give it a 2nd shot with pinnacle studio 17 plus and could not even get the software to install i tried several times restarted my computer and more and the installation would not run i saw others comment that they were able to install the software by doing it in pieces but i would not even know where to begin with that ps my computer does meet all the requirements listed on the box,107,4
1925,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after getting past some install issues with windows 81 i found the whole process of editing videos to be somewhat of a hassle compared to other programs I have used in the past such as windows movie maker or imovie the ui was very hard to navigate and it was just time consuming trying to figure out the simplest of features frankly i just do not have the time to learn this software and regret the time sink i spent on it,80,5
1926,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,i tried again and again to get this software installed on my windows 8 desktop by all normal means and it just was not going to happen the cd just would not run i was eventually able to install portions of this software by opening them up one-by-one by exploring the disc files i had to install them in bits and even that was not entirely successful i could not get all of this product installed on my computer so i was only able to try out portions of it although what i did get installed does seem to be working the experience of installing it was just too frustrating for me to be able to recommend this product to others,119,6
1927,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,pinnacle studio 17 plus is an easy to use program that is great for those who have a bit of experience with video editing software but users do not have to be an expert to get good results it is fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features installation was easy as well and ran with no difficulties although it took about 20 minutes to complete i was most interested in the live screen capture feature but it was a bit difficult to find users are required to look for it in program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it despite that small flaw live screen capture works well most of the time for instance it will capture video from minecraft flawlessly but I have had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games all around pinnacle studio 17 plus does a good job with minimal effort,154,7
1928,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,yes i now have two pinnacle products that i should never have purchased the other one is the studio 17 ultimate what was i thinking the product performed before par and i found it to be a pain in the neck to actually do what i wanted it to which is to help me edit photos simple right that is what i thought after the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems i had with studio 17 and being charged to get support i just gave up there are so many other programs out there that are far superior than pinnacle systems i would suggest going to your local best buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person no charge to compare programs to your needs that is what i did after i through this in the garbage along with the studio 17 sorry pinnacle this was my last purchase with you,155,8
1929,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,after trying and liking pinnacle studio 17 i was looking forward to giving studio 17 plus a try but there have been too many frustrations in just getting it up and running to really enjoy it as many others have pointed out installation takes hours a process that data mines every media file on your computer with no way to opt out i work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no i do not need to get bogged down in every file i ever processed each time i want to create something new the learning curve is steep on this the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly and as others have noted be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating I shall keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors,180,9
1930,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,compared to adobe premiere elements which costs the same this software blows it away in terms of features and capability i was using premiere elements for years but often got frustrated by the limited number of adjustments that i could me sure premiere elements let me run automatic adjustments with lightingcorrections and scene transitions but when i wanted to get fancy this software became limiting with pinnacle studio i am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than abode more scene transitions and I am able to tweak my videos in ways i never could before so far I am really enjoying this software after 3 weeks I am still discovering more that it can do some people noted the difficult installation i would not call it difficult i would call it time consuming but this i expect with any professional level video editing software these installations are huge especially with all the features macros effects and more that it installs also a strong processor is important when rendering videos i recommend 2 or 4 cores,174,10
1931,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,my video editing skills fall under the basic guidelines this package filled the need for some basic design concepts and was easy to use it did take a while tobut it is a large software package pros easy layout of basic features lots of options / templates for a quick start and consistent appearance great 2d and 3d rendering quick processing good interface cons snails pace install large software needs a fast processor or you lag a bit more advanced features are a little quirky to use steep learning curve if new to this program good program over all it is a nice platform and highly recommended,105,11
1932,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,this program is overly power hungry and takes 5 to 10 minutes to do the simplest things moreover it takes as long as 12 hours to import / ready even a 15 minute video for editing i do not recommended this program for the average user looking to make a quick home vodeo,51,12
1933,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,found it confusing it kept adding things to the video and there no instruction on how to get rid of them i switch back to the old version of pinacle studio,31,13
1934,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,good to have a 64 bit version of software i have used for years,14,14
1935,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,it is good so far just testing it out to make sure it does not have any hang,18,15
1936,Software,B00G6CLN3Y,1.0,negative,i tried to upgrade fro ps2 to use my zoom q2hd but this program would not recognize my device for screen capture no matter what i did i went to nch videopad which works just fine adios pinnacle you were a good old hoss once upon a time,48,16
1956,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i recently got an etrex summit gps and bought this software in order to download the trips i take into a printable format as well as to plan hikes before starting out on them the bottom line is that this 3 cd-rom set does not contain nearly enough information to do that i took a 4 mile hike this weekend near san francisco and downloaded it to the software it does show the track that we walked but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can not tell that we went up and down gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated furthermore the road into the park was not drawn correctly the ranger station and other services were not marked and so on in short the maps provided will not allow you to plan a hike which was the point in the first place right,155,0
1957,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,these maps contain a good amount of detail within the confines of existing technology the maps include dirt roads hiking trails streams waypoint and of course elevation changes these maps cover the entire us and are used in conjunction with garmin gps units i would recomend this software to anyone with a garmin gps who wants to camp or hike with their gps as a navigation tool however be aware they will not be accurate enough in many situations and you probably want to have a secondary navigation tool available to you my experience with the unit has primarily been driving through forest areas and short hiking and camping outings,110,1
1958,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i bought the garmin gpsmap 60csx and about 40000 worth of software i was under the impression that the topo us 2008 product was the digital equivalent of the usgs 24k but due to space concerns i assumed it would be perhaps half the resolution otherwise my gps would be the size and weight of a car battery i was greatly mistaken at how inaccurate it was after reading many other reviews i said heck with it and ignored thesayers in favor of purchasing it in my opinion thisis worthless i recommend that others avoid it garmins units are great but their maps and licensing especially the unlock wizards are a joke i recommend buying another product altogether thesayers are correct,129,2
1959,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i found mapsource to be a top rated program with a short learning curve i like it,17,3
1960,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i paid a lot of money for this cd upgrade for my garmin and i still have not downloaded it after a year i took it to two expert computer shops and they can not do it i went to website downloaded countless updates and drivers and it still will not work i will never buy a garmin product again,57,4
1961,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,it is taking me a while to get a hang of this product but I am able to download and upload tracks for my etrex legend and that was my main goal trip planning also looks useful it does not have many national forest trails in it and the trails it does have are generally poorly labled it is still a good way to make my gps more useful and possibly avoid picking up too many free trail maps to clutter my gear closet one gripe i have but may be me learning is that you do not seem to be able to open a saved map file and then add a new track to it that makes it hard to create a long-term record of ones hikes,123,5
1962,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you want more detail then get the larger scale maps these serve the purpose of their scale 1100000 if you need more detail then you will need mapsource us topo 24k national parks it has a scale of 124000 that should be all the detail you need i only give 4 stars because it does not have some of the main trails of the northeast,65,6
1963,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,good as long as you do not require detailed maps and topography certainly better than the base map pre-installed on most garmin units but simply lacking in detail,27,7
1964,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,they sent me version 302 so i have to download updates to get it up to version 6x why do they send outdated versions and place the burden on the consumer and of course you will only realize your software is outdated when you have mind boggling problems getting it to work or even installed this is the way to drive away customers,62,8
1965,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i bought this software mainly for use onscreen on my new 60csx gps and so far it is been great for that I have also sampled some of the trip planning features on my laptop and that is worked out well too my only compliant is that the back roads are not labeled on my gps screen so it makes it hard when I am driving and want to know quickly what road I am looking at but the routes are pretty accurate so i can usually identify by that also some of the data is out of date for those remote roads I have found a couple so far that are listed as roads but have been converted to hiking trails or reverted to elk trails many years ago coupled with a more detailed and sometimes more recent although not always forest service map it is just fine well worth it for adding detail to your onscreen gps maps,152,9
1966,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i love this product first copy this disk to your hard disk and then install from there then you do not have to used the cd each time youthe mapsource application also be sure to download the latest version of mapsource from garmin after you install the cd version,50,10
1967,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,basically what you would expect in a 124k topo set the thing to be aware of is that these are topo maps not trail maps although they do seem to have a lot of the major trails on them I am using them to plan a trip to four national parks this fall one notable feature of this set is that it can be installed 100 onto the computer hard drive without jumping through any hoops so once you have installed the maps you can put the cds away for safekeeping,90,11
1968,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,their software is very bad difficult to use expensive full of errors and gives a lot of problems a package costs over 100 and it does not even work,28,12
1969,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,mapsource topo us has out dated maps by at least 6 - 10 year in pa and half the time the map dose not line up with the gps with roads and elevation when i emailed them about update i was told that the government sends them update and they have not gotten any in a while to me it sounds like there depending on other people to do there work for the price they charge they should be checking on the updates or doing them,83,13
1970,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,only get this mapset if you have a specific need for terrain information i was a little disappointed about how painfully out of date the trail information is and this only leads me to believe that some of the terrain information is probably outdated too certainly mountains do not change often but some trail land does i got it for terrain information of hawaii and it was adequate in this instance there was not the option of using the national park mapset i can not say personally but i would hope the national park mapset is more up to date,97,14
1971,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i got this software a couple of months ago and i still have not been able to figure out how to use it the instructions that come along with the package assume you are a computer geek pass on this unless you have a lot of time to try and figure out how to make good use of it,58,15
1972,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this software used in combination with my gps is fantastic i am more confident in the woods even in the dark the best part is while on the road I shall never have to stop and ask for directions again you will never have to admit to your wife your lost again,50,16
1973,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,many people have complained about the inaccuracies and lack of detail that garmins topo software provides however i am completely satisfied with this product it has more than adequate detail for my hiking and mountain biking needs and provides a ton of additional roadways over the basemap those of you who just intend on getting by with your basemap do not know what you are missing if you intend on doing a lot of out of state travel you would be wise to also invest in garmins city navigator software which places more emphasis on maps of major metro areas the software is a joy to use requiring little effort to copy maps onto a compatible gps also mapsource topo does not require an unlock like other garmin products just install and go,131,17
1974,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,not for the serious hiker this map is way off on it is accuracy want to plan a hike on your pc before hand forget it contours are 100 feet incurements very limited reference points actually had me on the wrong side of a creek no bench mark refferences use your garman gps it is a great tool but do not waste your time or money with this map stick to your usga maps,70,18
1975,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i just purchased this software with a garmin etrac legend i drove to the seacoast down many major highways that were not on the map even although they are 10 to 15 years old on my garmin i am always north of the features on the map i do not know if this is a map error or a gps error the mapsource software on the cd is old by several versions the new software is free online you do get what you pay for this software is not expensive but it is not very good on detail either,98,19
1976,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,probably mapsource deserves a higher rating but i have only used it deer hunting in eastern oregon so far it was easy toand added a lot of detail even in a very rural area with only forest service roads the contours helped me to keep from falling into a ravine and being forced into a direction that i did not want to go i can not wait tomore of the map and some different areas i like the fact that you only have towhat you will be using it did not take as much memory as i expected it would i would not use a gps without it again,113,20
1977,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,it is easy tobut the data is old and does not show accurate local information it was too broad for my use,24,21
1978,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i bought this software to help navigate the logging roads and mountain biking trails in north kitsap county washington state what trails are shown are largely accurate but not perfect some logging roads show a dead-end where it actually continues still although it is way better than nothing and impressive topo data,51,22
1979,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,pros 1 memory requirements are no problem the 64 mb card can easily swallow several states worth of maps 2 if you do not mind not having street names depicted this software can easily allow you to course navigate with the plethora of street detail included 3 contour and waterway detail is spot-on 4 overall i was impressed with the logging roads and trails depicted for the state of maine they matched my delorme paper maps contour-for-contour cons 1 you can not input two waypoints and get turn-by-turn navigation guidance for highway travel a la mapquest rather you have to manually enter waypoints for every bend in your journey and this goes for pc set-up 2 if you want your track to remain right on the depicted road while traveling on highways you must stay in a higher scale cuz when you zoom in you almost inevitably end up a millimeter or two off course on your screen 3 price,156,23
1980,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,while some of the maps are somewhat outdated the program provides decent to even very good coverge to make the gps 60 much more functional without this software you are missing out on much of the capabilities of the garmin 60 series to me it is a must have,47,24
1981,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,very imprecise poor and obsolete software lack of trails roads and more could be even danger in the remote area to person who trust it you will have some use but rather with good paper topographic map,37,25
1982,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you understand this products limits before you buy it you will be happy it shows topographical contours rivers and most streams for the entire united states in addition to that it shows roads that were in existance 10 - 20 years ago these major roads are also named the limit is that newer roads do not show up it also does not support auto-routing even if your gps does garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package is not suited for it the product support could be better neither the manual nor web site tell you how toall 3 cds on your computer so you do not have to swap cds when transitioning between zones the companys web site does not give a good explanation of what the software can and can not do you will be disappointed if your expectations are not grounded in reality garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available,169,26
1983,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i went to the ponderosa and sawtooth mountains with my new mapsource all of the major trails and many of the smaller ones i hiked were mapped the screen was easy to read at both close-up and enlarged formats i would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys the mountains and forests,52,27
1984,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,if you hike in areas not covered by mapsources national parks 24k then this is the only way to get topo maps into your garmin gps unit the scale is 1100000 in united states topo whereas the national parks version is 124000 so you get less detail but complete coverage one nit-pick although it is not garmins fault the 1100000 scale usgs maps are in metric so garmin converted the meter contours to feet which means that even contours like 1000 meters is shown as 3280 feet at least you do not have to deal with elevations in meters although,97,28
1985,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,this gps mapping program is a real disappointment to begin with there is insufficient documentation to get started using it once you do fumble your way through you discover that it lacks detail enough to be very useful it is an outdated program for todays powerful gps units,48,29
1986,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,the detail is pretty poor i was expecting better since the bluecharts and citi select is outstanding,17,30
1987,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,the detail on this software is horrible there has an area we like to go camping and i found the area with this software it has one of the 3 major lakes in the area shows none of the forest roads hiking trails or campsites and i have it set on highest detail garmin makes great hardware but horrible software,59,31
1988,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i found out today 06/28/06 from garmin after i contacted them about a transter problim with the cd software that the last update to the soft was in 1999 i was superised that the program is this old frankly that is not addiquit but there is nothing i can do with that,50,32
1989,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,for hiking purposes these low detail topo maps are just barely ok there has so little detail it is not easy to create waypoints on your gps if your hiking trail is not already represented on this cd and believe me the trail data on this cd is not remotely up-to-date or detailed i honestly can not reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain united states parks one should always rely first on a godd printed hiking trail map but sheesh i was expecting more from these garmin maps,102,33
1990,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i live in colorado and am amazed at how terrible the maps on garmins mapsource are rivers start and stop roads that have been there since the 1800s do not show up none of the trails are named it is really bad i would think that if garmin was going to force us to by their maps they would make an effort to improve them i would say that anyone with a garmin who is going to use it for 4wd roads and hiking trails should buy another mapping program to get waypoints,91,34
1991,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i was very dissapointed in finding that the maps on the cd is very outdated the one cover the areas around my house just outside denver must be over 30 years old i am also dissapointed by the resolution of the maps not even near the picture shown on the box,51,35
1992,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,this software loaded easily on to my pc i was able to use it on the pc and then download it to my garmin 60cs without a problem i have not used all the features but for the off road riding i have done since i bought the software it has definately helped when navigating especially trying to find the fastest way back to base camp using roads that is powerline or forest roads my only complaint is that this software does not show all the roads and trails in the forrest i was riding in however it was comprehensive none the same,100,36
1993,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this is great product it has great detail and is extremely easy to use i found it a perfect match for my uses from work to hunting,27,37
1994,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,you sent the correctbut we did not order the one we really wanted i returned the garmin etrex vista and you sent refund information thank you now my daughters boyfriend has ordered the correct one for me the garmin map source cd rom is fine and we are keeping it,51,38
1995,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i was not sure what i was getting when i purchased this topo package but am very pleased it is a great addition to the tools that geocachers use with plenty of detail i was also surprised that many of the better known trails especially in state and national parks are marked on the maps however it is easy to get spoiled by that and i find myself wishing more of the trails were marked i still feel that this software will exceed most peoples expectations my state of virginia takes up about 36 mb of storage on my gps so to store a whole lot you will need a gps with a lot of room i loaded mine with just the areas i frequent the most and any planned geocaching areas as the need arises also if you know you are traveling to an area you can print the topo map and put it in a zip lock bag for a map to go,160,39
1996,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,a great map to have when you are out hiking off the trail i can find the easiest route around hills and swamps i wish to avoid long before they become a problem,33,40
1997,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,the topo softwear that is offered by garmin is the poorest quality i have ever seen i called garmin myself and found out that they have not updated the topo softwear in more than a decade plus they have rivers labled as strems major roads missing and no road where there should be a road i was so discusted with garmin i sent my gps unit back if your looking for good quality topo softwear for a gps unit try lowrance gps units there much better than garmin lowrance updates there softwear regularly,93,41
1998,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,if you are looking for a product that provides reasonable topography for camping hiking or just plain trail blazing this is it it is not intended to be used as a street map / guide although it has most major roads amazons price was great and i really enjoy the product my one nit is the installation instructions should indicate to install all cds on your hard drive then actually perform the installation by doing this eliminates the need to insert a cd everytime you want to pull up a chart,89,42
1999,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,it was not easy but i finally got my us topo software installed so i do not have to mess with the cds garmin needs to get on the ball and make this the standard install basically you need to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all the files from disk one into this folder using the copy command from the drop down menu will not work so you have to work around this issue on the second and third cd you will create subdirectories in the folder you created called east alaska and hawaii once done it will take a while do the setup command from the folder you created on your hard drive i had called customer support for a little assistance with this issue and after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes i discovered that the customer support at garmin sucks i love the gps i love the software but the customer support is a total waste of time amazoncom was quick with delivery offered my gps and software at a fair price and they were a pleasure to deal with as usual i will continue to purchase from amazoncom,195,43
2000,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,not recommended due to poor graphics delorme mapping is a much better product,13,44
2001,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,the software is great but i had to learn from the garmin technical support how to install the software on my hard drive without having to keep the cds handy it is simple just copy the cd s to your hard drive then install from there if you have already installed the software you will have to uninstall it first,56,45
2002,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,i use this software in a gps map 76cs when riding an atv it shows many existing atv and snowmobile trails sometimes with the trail name it also shows most logging roads with names where applicable streams lakes and ponds are also listed it is very accurate and makes it easy to see where you are in relation to known landmarks it is just what i was looking for,67,46
2003,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i purchased the us topo 24k national parks series last year because i needed topos of death valley this year i needed topos of nevada so i bought united states topo i was expecting the detail to be less than adequate but was pleasantly surprised every trail and jeep road we traveled was shown as well as all the abandoned mines and quarries we visited if you do not need the terrain detail of the 24k series give united states topo a try first the one thing i am disappointed with is the programs insistence of having the cd in the drive to work this is quite annoying mapsource city select and united states topo 24k both allow you to install all the map files to your heard drive united states topo should too,129,47
2004,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,lots of interesting data such as peaks and other landmarks the data is not very detailed sometimes however I am guessing that the data came from the 15 topo maps on a trip i made to yosemite the data had the same error contained on the 15 topo maps and the yosemite park maps itself apparently the 75 map has the right data the data had to do with the layout of some drainages,73,48
2005,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,the mapsource topo map cd is a great addon for the garmin gps units the original maps that were preloaded on the gps handheld unit were very minimal and now i have all the detail i need with the handheld unit i am a paper map kind of a person so i am very happy with the level of detail that comes with this program now my gps has enough detailed information to tell me exactly where i am so i can find myself on a paper map excellent simple program,91,49
2006,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i bought this cd to help me plan a hunting trip in alaska i had planned on using the computer topo in conjunction with my gps to plot routes to lakes valleysto hunt the topo maps for the area i am planning on hunting are incomplete there are large lakes missing from the map so the cd is limited in it is usefulness to me i have a paper topo of the same area and will be able to make my hunt no thanks to the cd-topo,88,50
2007,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,compared to magellan mapsend the detail provided by mapsource was poor not up to date and overall poor quality,19,51
2008,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i bought this product to be able to upload topo maps onto my garmin etrex vista this is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your garmin unit other software claims to work with your garmin gps but they only download / upload waypoints this software is way overpriced it runs off the cd-rom so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps i tried copying the cds to my drive and installing from there and it would not work when pulling waypoints / routes / tracks from the gps unit mapsource always opens up a new map document you can not import into the map you have open without copying and pasting this is probably the most overpriced counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since ms office what this all boils down to is if you need detailed topo maps for your garmin unit you will have to she shall out the cash and put up with slow unfriendly software,158,52
2009,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,this product is what it is it is not a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it it is a basic set of topo maps that shows most local roads what do you want for under 100 for a set of maps that covers the entire united states it does not have every street name the water maps are a little sparce and some of the feature names are dated i bought i like it i use it for what it is good for bottom line is that this is a tool like any other you would not build a car engine with nothing but a 5 pair of pliers but you could you can mow your entire lawn with a 29 string trimer but you would not this is a basic 100 set of maps of the entire united states for the price you can not beat the detail if i had it to do over again i would still buy topo united states because it works for me,169,53
2010,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i call garmin directly and asked them if i can find a product which helps me find new trails and i can install it on my notebook without using the cd the told me i need to use topo united states i loaded the program but it needed the cd i found out in here how can i install so never ask for the cd this is nasty the trail detail is that it will give you a point i hope at least the trail is crossing it i am used to the usual line to mark the way of the trail and not a point maybe it is a vertical trail straight up i hate the map i still like the gps do not buy this it is a waste of money attila csakberenyi,131,54
2011,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i installed this software package on my year-old computer but when i tried to start it i just got an error log file to be emailed to garmin their tech support department was closed worse another garmin software package metroguide had now stopped working and the windows uninstaller kept crashing when i tried to remove them a good hour and a half later i have finally reinstalled metroguide and made it run but united states topo is going back to the store i already have enough things that do not work,89,55
2012,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,this software is garbage it barely works even after being updated to the latest version available on their web site try zooming in or panning the map or transfering to your gps and 90 of the time it will crash or tell you an error occured i can not beleive a company with a name like garmins would ship something so completely useless and overpriced if you have a garmin gps and you want maps for your gps you are stuck with garmins software so do not buy a garmin gps either,90,56
2013,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,to bad there was not a choice to give this 0 stars mapsource maps are not good enough to deserve 1 star i spent over a thousand bucks on a garmin streetpilot and the mapsource unlock keys the streetpilot would be a great investment if it used maps other than those ones produced by mapsource if i use my streetpilot as the gps receiver and hook it up to my laptop and run microsofts mappoint i get much more detailed maps and better accuracy if garmin wanted to improve their product they would leave the hardware alone and ditch mapsource,97,57
2014,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,the maps are a great addition to my etrex vista downloading was a piece of cake i was able to get the entire state of mississippi and parts of the surrounding states on the vista 24 mb every road and back road that is several years old are on here typical of any topo map you can go to garmins website to see what is shown in your area going from having only the major roads to having all land marks streams small lakes elevation lines really adds to the gps the amount of detail can be adjusted to your preference I have also been impressed with how accurate your position relative to the landmarks are i rated it only 4 stars because i noticed the price got jacked up from 76 to 90 bucks i bought this only 2 weeks ago,135,58
2015,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,this works adequately on my new gps v the only problem is the topo maps do not allow auto-routing by the v to calculate routes around trails and more so it is back to standard gps map navigation but one use I have found is this some points of interest are not in the gps v base map nor are they in the against city select software so i simultaneouslythe topo software and presto i can pick out the topos points of interest set a waypoint up then route to it via the city select map it works fine that is unless you are finding a place which doenst have a road but for driving to trail heads and other topo type features it is helped me but it loses a star since i can not route directly on the topo maps on my v,137,59
2016,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i had said not to buy thisbecause it was an old version that was not true there are 2 versions on the product the application is version 409 the newest shipping version the maps are version 302 they are rarely updated amazon is a great place to purchase this,52,60
2017,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,in a prior review i stated that the mapsource topographical software looked good on the computer screen but that i had not yet tested it in the field now i have i gave it it is first tryout on a long difficult mountain bike ride in a remote part of henry willard coe state park near gilroy california it worked as well on the gps as it did on my pc and again i have no hesitation in recommending it perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with united states geological survey topographical maps or other navigation aids so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed i agree with a prior review that it would be helpful to include a feature displaying the elevation profile of a given route,135,61
2018,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed with this software where quadrangles have been spliced together the roads railroads rivers and contour lines do not meet across the join line signatures change at quadrangle borders also the data are not up to date in hamden the canal rail-trail is shown as an active railroad finally there are very few identified streets overall the product looks like a rough draft rather than a finished product,71,62
2019,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,the software works fine and uploads easily the maps seem to be 10 plus years out of date since they are missing sections of state highway and local streets in the greater seattle area that have been completed for at least that long it also does not include street names for local streets only state and federal highways i noticed it does include local streets for some small villages in alaska i definately would not recommend this set for urban navigation but i do like the topigraphocal features and the shoreline markers but have not been able to determine if they are up do date,105,63
2020,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,we bought this software for the purpose of locating hiking trails and downloading the info into our etrex vista the vista by the way is a great little unit this topo software is not anyway the topo software did not contain a single hiking trail for many of the falls that we hike to in the adirondacks thumbs way down for this product if you are a hiker,68,64
2021,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i bought this product for hikes and to guide me in navigating rivers only very major roads are named so i can not use this very easily to calculate my route there most roads are there but they just vanish at some points and reappear in others using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should the elevations and detail are very course no trails are shown i am not very happy i bought this product and am going to look into the roads and recreation to see if it does a better job fyi i bought this to use with my etrex legend which i think is just great,128,65
2022,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this product did exactly what i needed it to do and at a very reasonable price this used edition came in very good shape looks like it was hardly used used the upgrade available from garmin just went to help check for updates the program then works well with my garmin gps 60csx,53,66
2023,Software,B00004Z0C8,2.0,negative,i did not care for this product because the maps for the areas to the west of the mississippi river have no street level detail to show county roads or streets away from major cities good luck trying to plot a course to a location out in the country that is any distance 1 mile or more off of a major interstate highway or is not a national landmark,68,67
2024,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,garmin products come with an unlock code they can only be installed on one computer and used on one garmin gps device i bought this produce used and so it is my own fault for not considering that the unlock code would be used as well so yes the disks are in perfect condition yes these are genuine garmin disks no i can not use them to put topo maps into my garmin legend purchasing garmin software used is a pointless exercise in disappointment if you are going to buy them you need to buy them new and you need to purchase one copy for every device you are going tothe maps on so if you have three garmin gps units in your family you need to purchase three copies of the software shame on garmin,135,68
2025,Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,i bought this for my son in law to use for fire mapping in wyo he has happy with it so i am too,23,69
2026,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,product arrive ahead of schedule and was exactly as advertised i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for one,21,70
2027,Software,B00004Z0C8,1.0,negative,so someone gave me a garmin 60csx with the united states topo 3 cd set i was excited and was hoping i could use this gps for navigation on road and in the boat apparently not first off it takes hours and hours to figure out the mapsource software that is once you finally download the right version then it is not clear anywhere that addresses are not included so after wasting hours i finally do some google searching to find out these maps cover nothing at all really and trails or whatever else you might want good luck i simply wish the names of rivers were on the darn thing i live in florida we do not have mountains so i am scratching my head wondering what good this thing is i guess since i am a boater i could spend 300 to get the bluechart but after seeing the value of the topo maps i am concerned about throwing good money away for a lackluster product oh well it was free so who really cares i can always use it on the boat as a backup unit,189,71
2028,Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,this mapping software for my gps garmin 76csx was a great help in finding trails and roads it was close for elevation in the area thanks,26,72
2029,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,i always thought that publisher 2000 was easy to use this upgrade is even easier even someone who has never used publisher before can make outstanding postcards flyers newsletters and publications what a excellent product,34,0
2030,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,as much as i hate to admit that microsoft has done a good job i have to on this one the improved interface makes it so much easier to use users of old versions of publisher will be pleasantly surprised that this one is definitely worth the money for the upgrade if you have never used a desktop publishing program before check this one out you will not be disappointed i am running an entire small printing business from this program alone the only reason i have not given 5 stars is because i still want to be able to create text boxes in shapes round triangleinstead of square and rectangle,112,1
2031,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,this is a good product i have publisher 2000 and i like to added features and the new templetes realy worth the money microsoft has done it again with really great features and value,36,2
2032,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,publisher 2002 is a pretty good product i have not had any of the prolems that some other people have had it runs great on my machine never crashed once it has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it but stay away from the bundle with the photo editior included because the photo editior has almost no functionality,76,3
2033,Software,B00005AFI4,4.0,positive,while most people will tell you that microsoft bit the big one on their latest release of productivity programs the office xp suite i personally feel that they have done ok while the 2002 series does not differ too much from it is predecessors publisher includes what i think to be a very important feature stability there is not a sole on this earth that can deny the reliablity and stability of xp whether we talk about windows xp office xp or microsoft anything 2002 i dare you to try to make if crash good luck for those of you in corporations ask your employees what the most irritating part of their day is you will undoubtedly get the response when my tools crash while microsoft might have changed minor settings in publisher to make it slightly annoying for the few you can not go wrong with the increased reliablity of the product so suck it up shut up and enjoy it,157,4
2034,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,publisher 2000 was bad stupid me i thought maybe 2002 would be better not save your money and buy print shop or print master platium they work better for less money and take up less real estate on your hard drive the interface is even less intitutive that previously the most common task that even i can make word 97 accomplish will not work in publisher sorry microsoft i will not be buying this again everything the other reviewers have said times 10,81,5
2035,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,without a doubt the worst canned program i have encountered in almost 10 years of buying software after 2 months on the phone with support i have still not beat the kinks out of this dog bcentral is only to happy to charge me 30 bucks a month for hosting a site that will never be launched with this pig no wonder they include it with every signup a guarantee that the space on the server will never be used pass on this pig,84,6
2036,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,and you can not find a download for a very specific piece of software your friend needs it surprises you with a wonderful website that let us you purchase a copy for cheap and totally redeems itself thanks internet and thank you amazon,41,7
2037,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,arrived quickly and in good condition with activiation code on the package i needed this to access some old files that coulldnt be opened in publisher 2010 worked great i prefer this version in a lot of ways,38,8
2038,Software,B00005AFI4,5.0,positive,this product was very price-worthy was easy to install and has performed perfectly since i bought it it is doing exactly what i hoped and more the product itself was in excellent condition,33,9
2039,Software,B00005AFI4,2.0,negative,my goodness you would think a 10 billion company could do better than this they talk about double sided printing you can not even print even or print odd pages you have to sit in front of your computer and print each and every page manually you can not print to an image file well yes you can but the low resolution makes the file unusable you can not print to a pdf printing to a post script file cut off half the image on one of the projects this product assumes your printing service uses publisher guess what most do not david,99,10
2040,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i agree poor girl i am a real newbie massage therapist turned computer user and have found this program to be a web creators nightmare i think I shall cruise on down to the freeware sites to see what i can scare up there i want a fairly simple web page that links to a few more for those of us that know the anatomy of the human body better than html i would stay away from this beast it will make the less confident feel even more so and by the way these other sugar coated reviews does microsoft pay some slouch to type them up all day or what nauseating,108,11
2041,Software,B00005AFI4,1.0,negative,i was looking for a helpful upgrade and instead got perhaps the most user unfriendly software i have used in a long long time i am a software tester by profession and would have failed this product on poor usability stay with the previous version,45,12
2042,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i bought this product and love the results on my screen unfortunately it does not look so beautiful anymore when i print the pages out the preview and printout are fuzzy as if in draft mode all my other applications print out just fine i contacted novas technical support but the only help they offered was to send another disk which did not solve the problem now they ask me to be patient while they try to figure out my problem i have waited a few weeks now and am very disappointed no matter how great the software is if there is no real technical support it is worthless,108,0
2043,Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this software gives great guidlines for begginer scrapbookers,8,1
2044,Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this is pretty easy to use and I am having fun with it i can not compare it with any other scrapbook programs since this is the only one I have used but from what i see this is really all i need,40,2
2045,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i absolutely love this program and totally agree with the lady that found it to be one of the best programs that she owns i have had no problems with this program locking up or anything i made our christmas cards on it this past year and got lots of compliments i also made scrapbooks as gifts for christmas and got many compliments on my work this is a wonderful program and i am so happy that i purchased it,80,3
2046,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i would like to say this is a great program but it will noton my computer i have never had this problem with any other program before some kind of computer glitch blamed on everyone else other than the person i happen to be talking to at the moment after about 30 mins of several toll calls and a couple downloads no luck well I am off for another program,70,4
2047,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i almost did not buy this program because of the negative reviews but having worked in retail before i realized that people are more likely to complain than say anything posative i love this program i could go on all day about it i have so many ideas for projects and that is great because there are endless possabilities with this program you can make your project as personal as you want it to be add graphics of your own or alter their graphics to suit your mood you can add pictures and make them look antique as well as shape them into various shapes and styles add text here lighten here change colors it is fabulous as far as the pictures printing out clearly I have had no problem of course when altering your pictures if you force it into a shape that the pixels can not accomadate certainly there would be some problems digital pictures work best but my scanned ones have done well too just have fun and play with it i would reccomend this program to anyone interested in a unique and fun way to save their memories,187,5
2048,Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,i was disappointed when i tried to play around with this product it is going back to the store today you can not print out just an element of the scrapbook other than stickers without printing out an entire layout so if for example you want to use one of the few borders that comes with the program or have the time to tweak shapes into borders or mats or whatever beware you must print the whole page and you can not export images either this is basically a limited unflexible clipart program that might be good if all you want is to design for the web using the few choices of graphics they have otherwise stay away and save for a real scrapbook program i have not tried hallmark keep scrappin with scissors and paper if this is the best there is out there,143,6
2049,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,i already had scrapbook factory on a different computer i have all of my business forms in that program but did not have the disc any longer the only drawback is not being able to copy all of my old forms onto a flash drive if you buy this keep up with your discbecause it will not recognize the program it was made from when you try to open old files from a flash drive,72,7
2050,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,this edition of scrapbook factory is not nearly as good as scrapbook factory deluxe 4 i have played with all four editions and they got it right with the fourth one three is close and as far back as i am willing to go although you can not extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages in four you can create jpegs as well as pdfs of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive it took me all of a half hour before i had my first page done showing people the ropes of the software i gave version four as a christmas gift to a few people took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own you can get a copy of four for about 2000 more than this version and i feel it it well worth it many pages i have done people think were done with 40000 photoshop do not waste your time with this software evolves over time and generally becomes more powerful and user friendly as it evolves,187,8
2051,Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,what a disappointment considering modern day programs this one is primative it reminds me of apps 15 years ago it is complicated yet limited in what it can do i have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as front it can not be done I have clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest no luck even the tutorial is non-interactive additionally pages can not be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste further each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects the help section is also very basic one good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job additionally no problem running this with windows 7 have not used any other scrapbook programs but i sure would not recommend this one,156,9
2052,Software,B00005NZXQ,1.0,negative,i am extremely displeased with this product the software is anything but user friendly and the graphics are extremely cheesy any attempts i made at developing a scrapbook page were foiled due to extreme frustration with the program overall the product needs a drastic update and i am disappointed with my purchase,52,10
2053,Software,B00005NZXQ,5.0,positive,to those with print quality issues it is your printer or printer preference settings there is a lot of flexibility and creative potential with this software it is also easy to use my 10-year-old who never saw it before jumped right in and is creating terrific pages can not beat it for the price,50,11
2054,Software,B00005NZXQ,2.0,negative,I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook with so that i can still print out pages and not just have them on the computer this one does not print well at all I have tried printing one of thier premade pages pages I have created from scratch with and with out pics put in and everything comes out pixilized i have not had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges i do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as i do not use this program another thing i found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic if you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them this program would be ok if you do not want to print the pages out but if you do look for something else,162,12
2055,Software,B00005NZXQ,4.0,positive,this program is easy to use and helped me create a custom scrapbook page with little effort one caveat once you select a size template be certain to check the result with print preview before you expend any effort i had trouble getting the first page i created to print in 12 x 12 size on a 12 x 12 sheet of paper however i called tech support the first rep did not help much but then i got a follow-up call from derek who had gone to the trouble of downloading my canon s9000 printers driver together we got the print function going and produced a perfect page it is really refreshing to find a software outfit that really cares about the results it is customers are getting it is too bad that the templates supplied with this program are so cutesy and schmaltzy and that more background paper is not supplied but if you start with a blank template hey it is a clean slate and you can let your imagination run wild it will let you drop in your pictures and graphics wherever and help with the lettering for titles and journaling,189,13
2056,Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i travel on the road all the time and i use my gps and laptop to find my way around i would have to say that the software that comes with the garmin gps is a hundred times more accurate and useful i have found that many of the roads in street atlas were labeled wrong or just plain drawn wrong there is a lot of old information and not updated regularly i live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in street atlas 2004 it still did not have my neighborhood in it and i live near a major city i can not recommend this software for other than very basic information you can get a paper map that will work better,125,0
2057,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i have been using the 2004 version of this program for about 5 months before i finally upgraded to this version on my p2/250 laptop it runs slowly but not nearly as slow as the 2004 version did i just purchased a gps device for it and love how it integrates with it i travel extensively in my job and having the gps feature makes finding where I am going very easy there are some inaccuracies with the pois as others have stated but they are not so far off that you could not find them with a little looking around at least with them marked on the maps you get a very goodwhere they are web based maps are good to have but when you have to travel to several locations in a day it is impossible for me to get online to find where I am going with this in my vehicle i can get where I am going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks i recommend this program to anyone looking for a mapping program especially if you have a gps device to find where you are and where / when you have to make your next turn,203,1
2058,Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,after using street atlas 2005 for one trip i find it was worth making the upgrade one new feature is that it shows the next turn and the turn after that in the show turns window it also gives this information in the voice navigation this will eliminate a number of instances where i have used the voice commands to obtain this information the number of trail points is now settable which can clear the map and reduce theon the computer there is a new version of the microsoft speech recognition software the file system has been simplified with the option to return to the full system if desired via a patch available free from delorme the program loads much quicker i recommend buying street atlas 2005,129,2
2059,Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,i bought this product expecting the excellent results i have had from delorme products for years it is been a nightmare trying to get it to work i have tried installing it six times on two different computers and i can not get it to plot a route i put in a start and finish point and it plots a straight line between the two points others have had this same problem as related on the delorme forum so it is not just my computer or my installation technique every other delorme product i have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem i have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply after five days on their forum i was told to follow the instructions for a so-called clean install but when i followed them three times i got the same result I am sending this obviously inadequately tested and bug-filled software back for a refund,159,3
2060,Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,delormes product is dynamic it works out-of-the-box as a gps navigation companion it will automatically start talking to you and guiding you from where you are and take you toward your destination if you get off-track it re-routes you automatically within seconds microsofts product is static or dead connected to a gps it will show you where you are but do not expect it to think ahead I have used it numerous times and it had been helpful because it is an accurate map and shows where you are but that is it there is a lot more to giving someone good directions than just saying this is where you are you want to know when to get ready to turn up ahead so you can prepare for it delormes software will do that for you and do it very well,137,4
2061,Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,problems in many areas buggy installation i had to re-install after a squeeky clean reboot on xp had to use msconfig to boot with no other drivers the software still has trouble locating well-established addresses and significant landmarks weak find function can not identify addresses with any intelligence user interface is not intuitive at all ambiguous commands poor screen / button layout I am trying to be patient and tough it out but frankly i would not buy it knowing what i know now i also have msft streets and trips and although it has limitations as a navigation tool the u / i is much easier to use no problems with installation and the data is far more complete,117,5
2062,Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i was blown away by this product in the sense that i could not imagine that such a well-functioning piece of software could be rendered virtually unusable by a horrendous interface the controls are tiny numerous and often cryptic to set up your gps mouse for instance you would have to click the exchange button do not even think about using this product while driving it is not suitable at all for a touch-screen display having said that the maps themselves are accurate and the programs packs a ton of useful information,91,6
2063,Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,i have a long commute and wanted to figure out which back roads were ideal i was deciding between microsofts streets and trips 2005 and this program i think the deciding factor was that the delorme software has the ability for me to manually choose other roads besides the roads the program recommends microsofts version does not seem to offer this at least they do not mention it by allowing me to choose my own roads i can avoid rush hour roads that are not ideal even although they are the calculated ones it may not have as many pois but i was more interested in customizing and alterning suggested routes than points of interest that feature alone made the delorme worth it for me,123,7
2064,Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,i have used delorme products for a number of years and love the features the 2005 street atlas is a little slow to start but still nice to work with but they seem to have spent their time on features and not updating the database i live in northern virginia and was very disapointed with this release street atlas 2005 is headed for ebay and i cringed as i installed,71,8
2065,Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,in some areas the software worked great but in others it was off by hundreds of feet showing me on totally different streets around my house it was consistently off by 800 feet and displayed my position one street away this is not due to the gps receiver the receiver gives the right coordinate data if you plot that data by hand on the map you will be positioned wrong this indicates that the maps are not calibrated right tech support was worthless all they tell you is that you can return it before 30 days of course you are still out the tax and the cost of sending it back do not buy this product until they have fixed the maps consider yourself warned,124,9
2066,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,I am not the greatest remembering maps so when i got a usb gps receiver i was psyched granted at that time i did not have any software but i did not know that so i went out and got street atlas which happened to be the first piece of navigation software i found that was version 2004 I have been hooked ever since i used to get lost in downtown buffalo all the time now i do not get lost anymore i loved 2004 so much i got 2005 and it is a big improvement the user interface is much easier than in 2004 and in 2004 it was easy and i mean super-easy you can install the entire continental united states and fit it comfortably on your hard drive and map out a trip from one end of the country to the other and get there without getting lost for those techie people like me who get lost all the time this program is like a godsend you can even print out directions on your desktop and e-mail them give them to friends so on and so forth without a gps receiver,189,10
2067,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,I have used delorme street atlas since gps receivers were novel and cost hundreds of dollars i have liked every version they have put out and 2005 is no exception the reason i bought the 2005 version even although it is now 2009 is because it installs and runs easily in through wine in linux including usb / serial gps support newer versions tested up to 2008 as of this review do not install and/or run well via wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored street-level navigation in linux if you want updated cartography and new handy features go with a newer version all versions of delorme street atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag however if you want a street-level nav program for linux that does not require internet access and uses vector rather than raster maps delorme street atlas 2005 is your best bet,157,11
2068,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i use this software to map out a garage sale route it is simple and basic and allows me to flag each address on the route some of the features i could use in the future for a trip or something but right now it is garage sales,47,12
2069,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,street atlas just keeps getting better i can go from anywhere but usually from home to a place I have never been to using the directions fastest shortest or scenic I shall know the mileage and have a good estimate of the time i can locate other places i may need anywhere along the way mealsrepairs hotels and more i find it much faster and more intuitive than any of it is competition we also find it helpful finding hiking trails / points of interest and areas set aside for recreation on weekends the ability to print out a travel package is helpful for when i am not using a pc,106,13
2070,Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,street atlas 2004 has a problem that if the version of windows is not english or if the user sets languages other than english as their default language set on us version of windows sa 2004 does not work at all so i have to change the language setting of my us version of windows xp and reboot the computer every time that i need to run sa 2005 it was so cumbersome and i wished that this problem is fixed in sa 2005 however sa 2005 has the same problem and it seems like delorme does not care about this problem at all if you are a user who uses different language setting on windows you should try microsoft streets and trips instead of sa 2005 sa 2005 has better gps capability than ms s and t however my choice is s and t for this reason i gave 2 stars because it does a job sometimes when i do not mind rebooting my computer and giving up other jobs that need asian language support i do this once or twice a year,183,14
2071,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,this is a big improvement over previous versions of this software the back on track feature works great if you take a wrong turn the software automatically calculates a new route to get you back on track much much better than microsoft streets and trips in the gps and navigation areas,51,15
2072,Software,B0002IP3KM,1.0,negative,i bought this software and found that it could only work when win xps regional setting set to united states english since i had to have another regional setting because of my job the software was no use another thing is that there is misinformation on the products box it claims that delorme includes major roads and highways in canada while it is competitors do not the fact is that while delorme only covers major canadian roads microsofts streets and trips 2005 can generate detailed maps of canadian streets just as what it can do about united states addresses microsofts product can produce driving directions in canada too which delorme can not do one good thing about delorme mapping street atlas united states 2005 is that it has a 30 day money back guarantee i have returned my purshase and got the microsoft streets and trips 2005 instead,142,16
2073,Software,B0002IP3KM,4.0,positive,i purchased street atlas 2005 as i was so satisfied with aaa mapngo from delorme the mapping program is absolutely great it is operation is really quite simply and anyone can work it it is much better than microsoft streets which i had the 2002 version the only fault is that their data base is too old and does not seem to have a lot of the development in the last 2 or 3 years of motelsstations and resturants,79,17
2074,Software,B0002IP3KM,5.0,positive,i have used delorme street atlas for years in my genealogical hobby i have found it amazing that it has so much detail of both urban and rural roads and also topographical features used in combination with a gps and delorme atlas and gazetters i have been able to locate drive directly to many obsecure locations,56,18
2075,Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,as a real estate appraiser i travel from point to point and then write reports about each site the gps and voice functions are irrelevant i never use them the report writing function is where i need a program daily and for my purposes which is entirely for drawing labeling and map notes for each site to be placed into a report this program is an order of magnitude worse than the version it replaced lots of new features just complicate the program and make the simple features i need harder to replicate and work with sometimes the map will zoom or reduce unexpectedly due to a casual move of the pointer that was not intended to produce this effect on balance i hate it the bright side you can find things with it if you are willing to battle and fight the complex functions to do so,149,19
2076,Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,findings after brief trial pros 1 provide voice driving instructions but those instructions may be confusing in some situations 2 accept speech commands it is quite fancy cons 1 it will ask you to turn left / right where you are not allowed to do so this is quite dangerous 2 some map informations are egregiously out of date a road removed by freeway construction a decade ago still appears on the map and i was asked to go through it 3 it does not locate my location precisely with gps it claimed that i was driving on a freeway when i was actually on a local road next to the freeway i wonder how it can think this way as i did not get into any freeway entrance can i simply jump into the freeway ms streets trips did not show this problem using the same gps receiver,142,20
2077,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,did you ever beat on a garbage can lid with a wooden spoon well that is the sound you get from cakewalks music creator 6 the guitar rythmn sound is also shabby to say the least if you want a good backup music program just invest in band in a box you will be glad you did,56,0
2078,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,well this is not a bad daw i found out after using this that i prefered cubase or sonar which is the upgraded version of cakewalk this is however a good daw to get your feet wet or to record a few mics at one time if you need to work on guitar parts you will need nothing more than this my needs have grown greatly and can not use this anymore but for the starter or small studio i do recommend this or cubase le,84,1
2079,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,because my new samson go mic has bundled cakewalk software i decided to try cakewalk music creator 6 this software is a disaster in stability the bundled software was just as bad i got to use music creator 6 only twice before it continued to come up with an error message stating that the one exe file that opens up the whole thing was missing i must have uninstalled and re-installed this software six times on my computer and cleaned up everything involved with this program short of causing problems for other programs on my computer also customer service was terrible cakewalk needs to spend more time trying out their own software with various computers and operating systems and looking for problems rather than focusing on the art of rigid programming rules musicians do not want to waste time with programming musicians want to create cakewalk should either fix these problems or take a walk do you get it cakewalk i was with this software and oh this is mild commentary as I have had two weeks to cool off a bit i sent it back to amazon for a credit thank you amazon for your graciousness,196,2
2080,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,i did not know if mc 6 would work on my laptop it works fine and will probably meet my needs when i get some additional gear and time to use it all,32,3
2081,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this is a great music arranger at a very low price point there are many instruments available and you can interface with actual midi capable instruments,26,4
2082,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,it is great fun it would be much better i had were more knowledgeable about computers and more though overall i am learning how to use the program as i play a digital piano for the price it has a multitude of capabilities for me the tough part is mastering the software i have a granddaughter that loves to record her own songs I had never tell her that she needs to work on her singing it is just great fun,74,5
2083,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,because i got music creator 5 on one of my anther computers but this program u can touch and it have everything u need to produced ur music yes it is professional,30,6
2084,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,i bought this software thinking i could use it to record songs it will not take my guitar input even although it is running through a very good usb device I have only been playing since 1966 and working with computers since they came out i have decided that it was worth the 32 dollars just to gain the knowledge that cakewalk is way to complicated for normal people,67,7
2085,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,great fun i had the advantage of my brother tutoring me on a previous version there are also some nice online tutorials it will certainly take a long time to learn everything but i was able to import and edit sounds for my avant garde music class immediately i can not tell you anything about what ever is normally in these kind of programs but for me it was awesome especially at this price,73,8
2086,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,uninstalled it was getting errors runtime errors with windows 80 pro so i upgraded to windows 81 pro from windows 80 pro but still had runtime errors uninstalled it and errors went away but i had my magix music software install no problems i stay with my magix products they work great and are easy to use,57,9
2087,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,this is somewhat an extensive program that you will have to do some study on to utilize all the features,20,10
2088,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,i had tried another software and hated it this was just what i need to compose and record my music,20,11
2089,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,product worked fine then got a free upgrade to music cretor 6 touch having issues and quirks where program now freezes up or is not responsive or needs to be forced shut because of one thing or another need to find help to find the fix to this issue also basic knowledge of the program would be very usefull since all the tutorials are not as simple as one would hope,70,12
2090,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,the music creator 6 is very cool i use it on my music prodjects i can not stop use it it cool,21,13
2091,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,one of the best things is the vidio tutorial caught me up to date quick i was using music creator 3 and jumped to 6 but for the price this works great it takes a little while to find everything but for recording with an interface module you can be recording tracks in a couple of hours i have experience in recording from reel to reel to daws to computers I am having fun with this one thanks cakewalk stvy d,79,14
2092,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this product is always providing new avenues of creativity in my music recording i am constantly surprised by the avenues of creativity it presents i recommend it for any beginning artist,31,15
2093,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,do not buy this first of all i spent hours just trying to get the notes to not skip there has a latency menu that you have to look online by good luck and change to correct this it should have been adjusted from the factory then you can not just go to sharps and flats on a laptop unless you have a mouse then I am not sure if it works or not the old music creator was far better then menus and windows on this are awkard and non user friendly i think I am going to look up an older version of cakewalk music creator on ebay one star because there has not an option for no stars,113,16
2094,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,I am actually reviewing music creator 7 anyway i have been fooling with it for 3 months now and i do not like it for one thing the tech support is some of the worst I have ever encountered the product is not intuitive and the in-program help is not helpful neither is the cakewalk forum i have used earlier versions of cakewalk and know a thing or two about computers but this program just is a constant headache plus all the samples and clips that come with it are trash they are all house and electronica type stuff i do not see anything in the midi library and very little in the audio library that i would ever want to use but that is ok because i have not been able to get the latency down to a reasonable delay anyway not recommended,138,17
2095,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,may be is not your fault but i have a yamaha dgx-640 connected to the computer and i do not get no sound on the music creator 6 i followed all the directions from the creator but nothing i could use some help thanks alexndru davd,46,18
2096,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,if you are a musician like me and a recording artist you will like this software the program is simple and the software is so easy to use upon plugging in my electronic keyboard to the usb along with my microphone i can record and create songs right on my computer sa-weet,52,19
2097,Software,B004TO9M5W,2.0,negative,i spend more time being pissed at this program for latency bulls when trying to lay down more than one track at a time not to mention the crackling that never appears at the same spot in playback and recording and whenever it happens when trying to record vocals over my guitar it messes that entire vocal section up all i wanted was something that could let me lay down guitar vocals and drums in separate tracks i have a xenyx q802usb behringer to manage my eqs and i do not care much about midi so that whole part of the program is useless to me this is the first recording software I have ever tried outside of audacity and i was kinda expecting that since i was actually paying for it that it would come with a decent manual and do a good job handling my recording ha waste of my money and my time,153,20
2098,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,although i am no expert in this field i have found a few bugs in the program but so far exporting the audio and re-importing it has solved all the issues i have ran into i have no real experience with other audio recording software other than light use of audacity and an older cakewalk home studio 9 i do wish it had better tools for mixing but it does plenty for it is price,74,21
2099,Software,B004TO9M5W,2.0,negative,this may work well but it is complicated i have not made it work well for me the reviews said it was easy but i did not find it that way,31,22
2100,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,i just got this so maybe i have not given it alot of time but so far it is really nice the reception is great and the phone is very clear when talking directly or using the included hands-free kit it does take a while to boot but i probably will not shut it down very often the camera does not take super-great pictures but i did not get this phone because of the camera to be completely fair i have only viewed the pictures on the phone and have not emailed them to anyone i have read that they look better when viewed on a pc,104,0
2101,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,this is not really an out standing phonethat phone is the mixture of motorola v60 and the motorola t720ithe out look of that phone is like v60 and the inner look is as same as t720i,36,1
2102,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,my dad and grandfather have this phone have the chance to play with them and fiture them is a nice phone a mean a phone the camera is not that good o well is an adition so it will not be to good is not a new phone on the market so you can not coparate with v300 or e715 calls are preatty cleard the voice dial is nice and cleard the game is not good but the web t-zone works great so you can go and play games the polyphonic tones are nicewhen you downis and good avreage phone battery not a big issue becs my e715 drains fast as well the v300wth avreage use can last 23 days so really if you want a feature phone get e715 or if do not have the get v300 if you want a nice avreage phone with phone features get this is not all that but is not that bad as people said,162,2
2103,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,I have had this phone for an extremely unfortunate 6 months the other day it started making noise while on vibrate so i had to get another one good display is big and not awful you can close the phone while the earpeace is in external identification umm reception is acceptable I am shooting for anything here bad enormous flimsy camera really sucks screen gets dirty while talking slowwwww most ringtones are obnoxious just annoying and ugly 2 out of 5 just do not get it it is as simple as that get an e105 or v300 or something just do not get this,97,3
2104,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,i had this phone for about 5 days before i wanted to toss it out the window it rings when there is no call comming in and will not stop i returned it to the store where i bought t-mobile it but because it had been 35 days instead of 30 they said they could not exchange it for a new one but would give me a previously used phone after 5 replacements i bought a nokia the camera sucks and the battery life and signal suck too,87,4
2105,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,one of my good friends has this phone and she hates it with a passion the battery life sucks the screen goes out when u open it too quickly or hard and the phone itself is flimsy i was about to get this phone because of the good cash back deal but glad i did not,56,5
2106,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,i have cdma version and battery life is short even not using games thedisplay looks faded it is case looks cheap and fragile buttons do not work well sometimes you have to force them there has no software for downloading from pc so every little thing you want toon the phone ringtones wallpapersyou have to pay for not even want to mention the camera pure waste of money,71,6
2107,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,i got suckered in with the original price and then how much you get back when you sign up for service 1 do not use t-mobile nothing but problems and thier service range is horrible 2 i agree with the camera it stinks 3 not taking the charge is annoying sometimes i have to play with the phone for sometimes 20 minutes so i can charge it overnight 4 the phone is not durable at all and the screen turns all blue after opening the phone after it has been off the charger for an hour or so the phone will not function right and i have to close it and wait for a few minutes for the phone to reset my sister in laws does the same thing the phone should not do this overall i should have chose a little more wisely and know why they are giving so much back when you purchase the phone,158,7
2108,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,good has a very addictive games motogp is small in sizescreen has gprs bad unable to see the screen well in sunlight camera quality is terrible menu is slow and difficult to navigate has no infared nor bluetooth,43,8
2109,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them my biggest complaint is that there appears to be no way to go from high volume to vibrate noiselessly each push of the volume button makes a beep i loved that feature on my startac look elsewhere for a good flip phone,80,9
2110,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,cons everything about this phone is bad really bad the sound for one thing does not sound like polyphonic it is very fuzzy and some of the tones in the songs downloaded from the t-moble web site are missing the sony ericsson t300 has better sound than this phone the camera is svery bad on the screen of the phone unless you are outside with alot of light the pictures will come out horrible until you send them to your computer then their ok their is only one game motogp and that with the camera takes up all the memory so unless u delete somthing you will not be able to add any more games the menu screen is very slow to movethe colors are bad they are not that vivid and the backgrounds that it comes with it are dark and if you try to brighten the screen of the phone the picture turns almost white the phone is very slow i had to return my phone twice to fix the charger on the phone because it never charges and the camera it oftenly not detectedyou have to put it in more than 4 times for both the charger or camera to work i would not recomend this phone to anyone for 2 reasons the price of such a horrible phone should be free and the quality of this phone pros this phone are it is flip changeable covers battery life can be better this phone is reception is ok and the ear piece sound is good can be louder,255,10
2111,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,i recently bought this phone through t-mobile by upgrading my plan i got 50 instant rebate for upgrading and 100 extra mail in rebate the phone is awesome it takes great pictures and the resolution is pretty good many feautures quality and great reception the screen resloution can be better but this phone it is a must have for t-mobile customers i have owned many phones even the samsung v205 and the samsung has better screen resolution picture resolution is same on all phones but motorola has more features samsung is durable too as well as motorola I had go with either one but i prefer to use the motorola,108,11
2112,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,the phone is not really bad to say but could have been designed better for example the camera is seperated from the phone which makes it hard to grab it with you all the times,35,12
2113,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,this phone is pretty good compared to others my girlfriend has a samsung v205 and it does not seem to be much better the keypad [ is weak ] for dialing and the battery life is awful but the t722i is different sure sometimes it can be a little slow when you press a button but that is not a big problem the t722i has great battery life with up to 2 hours talk time a day the battery lasted about three days without charge the samsung v205 can not compare the features are nice with tmobile the tzones internet is not bad the camera attachment can be better it does need a lot of light but even then it does not give great resolution at all overall i am satisfied with this phone t-mobile is great no problems with their network whatsoever,137,13
2114,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,motorola has been a leading cell phone manufacture but i am disappointed with this phone some of the features are not working properly there is display delay of 2 seconds some button presses do not respond all the time the display quality is not good as samsung or sony phones the sound quality is replaced by a cheap dsp it is larger than same priced samsung phone and a small drop will kill the phone i had samsung nokia sony and motorola phones for past 10 years or so by far this is the most fragile phone i like the flip phones if you want a flip phone with good reliability and features get the samsung phone i am very supprised that motorola does not offer any blue tooth phone either they are behind in technology,136,14
2115,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,i recently purchased this phone from amazoncom for 9999 I am telling you this was definatly worth it this is one of the best phones out there now all the good features this phone is really worth it and the t-mobile service is great to do not waste anytime hurry up and purchace this phone motorola t722i,55,15
2116,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,I have been a t-mobile customer for many years but am very disappointed with my current phone the motorola t720i now called the t722i my first complaint arose on my first call the earpiece volume is very low even at maximum volume and some calls just have to be ended if they are being made in an environment with any background noise many other complaints followed most dealt with hardware quality my 1st one had a flaw in the flip mechanism that caused the phone to think it was being flipped shut when it was not ending calls unexpectedly the 1st and 2nd ones would routinely freeze up during calls the signal strength meter indicated full strength and the call timer was still counting but the person on the other end could not hear me anymore and was soon disconnected this daily occurrence required me to contact t-mobile and get a 3rd one of these phones which I am sorry to say still has the strange freeze problem all 3 have had the maddeningly low volume as well resolution and variable light functionality on the camera attachment are horrible as well as is thequality on the display in general it just looks washed-out almost black and white at times despite adjustments the good news is that customer service is great at t-mobile and they always replace the phone when i have problems avoid this phone however I am going back to nokia,237,16
2117,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,this phone should be less then free people should pay you to walk around with this phone i have owned this phone less then 2 months and i take really good care of it considering i wipe the screen off every time I am done useing it i clean it each day i even clean the lint out of my pocket before i put it in there but still for some reason lint and dust and hairs get under the screen in mine and my brothers and that is not the only problem i spend about 5 minutes each night just trying to get the phone to charge because the charger doesent clip in right or the phone just says unable to charge even of the phone hasent been charged for 2 days this phone looks good on line and sounds like a great deal with the camera attachment but let me tell you it is not take my advice and do not buy this phone it is a huge waist of money,169,17
2118,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,i actually own a 720i which is almost the same phone i have a few complaints about the phone the screen rubs on my face during calls the screen resolution is not as good as a couple other phones I have seen and the ring volume is no where near loud enough other than that it is got great ringtones and you can download about a million more i have not dropped a call in the six months that I have it the camera while not great is still a lot of fun i think that the battery life is not a problem although I have read a couple complaints i do not have any i just put a new full housing on it black with silver flames and it looks really really cool it is not the best phone on the market but it is still a very good one i would reccomend this phone to pretty much anyone who wants a camera phone,157,18
2119,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,i just bought the phone about 1 week ago the phone has a good battery life and lots of cool features the thing i like about this phone is that when you send a text message from aim you are not counted for a whole text message while with other phones if you send just a simple hi that is already 1 text message used the thing i am [ upset ] about is that you can not download new games i have tried soo much and you still can not the pixelation is somewhat ok it is not all that great and the camera does not show good quality pictures overall this is a good phone it has lots of nice features lots of ring tones and more you can download including wallpapers t-mobile customer service is great also but they need to expand their coverage area if you are looking for a phone to buy for just talking all the time then buy this one because it does give good battery life i did not have to recharge it for about 2 days and i was talking on the phone and i was on t-zones all the time now that is a good battery life if you do not like this one there are others like it out there the t720i t721i and that is about it,221,19
2120,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,well i just got this phone the other day and heres my immediate thoughts great price for the packagescreen flip camera free headset very useable belt clip to go into detail thescreen is good but not great a friend of mine has the sanyo 4900 and thescreen on that looks clearer during less light conditions but not as nice in highly lighted conditions the headset works fine the reception is 3 bars upstairs in my house and 2 bars downstairs call quality is better than the previous phones i have owned old sprint one and motorola startac changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine a very odd variety of ring tones as well to sum up pros customizable clear quality of calls variety of ring tones belt clip voice dialing consscreen in darker settings lack of variety of actual background pictures needs more memory,170,20
2121,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,i own a motorola t722i from t-mobile motorola has been a leader in the communications industry worldwide they produce some of the best cell phones on the market the t722i is very easy to use and you can customize it to what you want the features sets it apart from other cell phones it is a flip-open phone so you can fold it and it is a nice small size if you want a phone that is packed with state-of-the-art features in a small size phone then get this phone i would stay away from nokia phones they are not built up to the everyday use the phones are weak and cheaply made generally it is good only for kids who want to get fancy by changing the face plates nokia phones look like tv remote controls in fact your tv remote is much better built then a nokia phone,146,21
2122,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,i purchased this phone as an upgrade from the sony t 300 which was one of the worst phones that i have ever bought but it was free after rebates but i diffidently like the moto better this phone is great i paid a lot but it was worth it thescreen is gorgeous i get a signal with that phone when some of my friends do not who have the same service t mobile as i do with there stupid nokia phones overall if you travel a lot then stay away from t-mobile is you do not and live close to a metro area then you are going to be ok t-mobiles coverage really needs to mature if i go to far from boise idaho then i have problems pick verizon if you can they have the best coverage known to man it seems like,145,22
2123,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,i didnot want the camera but it came with the phone i have not used it and do not care to but the phone itself is so much better than the verizon wireless that i had i can use it in my house something i couldnot do with verizon in the basement as well as elsewhere the signal is strong and clear it is not very user friendly but the customer care have been very helpful,74,23
2124,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,having used this product for two months including travelling with it i have not had as much problem with call dropping as other people have mentioned in fact my husband and i have had problems with reception and call dropping from other companies cingular and spring where reception on this phone has been clear and consistent i have even been able to receive calls in concrete buildings something other phones have not allowed the battery life is decent and having dropped our home landline most of our conversations are via cell i have been happy with the length of time between charges the handsfree is clear and i have had no complaints from callers on the other end about not being able to hear me ringtones are distinctive i also appreciate being able to have the phone on vibrate or silent I have always been a huge fan of nokia but this certainly supercedes all my nokia experiences the size and weight are great the phone fits well easy to talk into mouthpiece with ear in proper location voice activated calls very handy good voice recognition dislikes phone screen touching face when talking camera pictures are really quite blurry and poor quality camera makes noise when turning off storage capacity for voice activated calling small fyi not related to phone but to t-mobile for the shared family plan only one of the individuals gets tmobile access on their phone all in all I am very happy with my new phone,250,24
2125,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,this is a good upgrade from the 120 better battery life and a slightly updated styling make this another solid phone from moto designed in asia by a singaporean contractor the phone has that unique asian look but at least it is got motos cool factor definitely not as weird looking as sumsng phones and much better quality build and voice than the latter but I am still not hot on t-mobile count me as one of the many many unhappy t-mobile customers network availability is a huge problem here in brooklyn and network coverage is still poor in most of the country no signal in most of connecticut or florida even at t has better coverage and they were late in the gsm game,123,25
2126,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,well worth [ the ] pro voice dialing is good although of numbers is limited backlighting is cool volume is loud enough mini antenna small price looks cool does not heat up much con somewhat slow screen touches your cheek when you talk ring tones and wall paper cost 99 with t-mobile camera absolutely stinks do not buy this phone for the camera i would suggest it,69,26
2127,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,with this being my first wireless phone i am extremely pleased i was a little leary about buying a phone with rebates but everything worked out fine the features this phone has are amazing the battery life is great i let it charge for about 18 hours and it has not been charged again and it is been 2 days thescreen could be sharper but i can not really complain it comes with a ton of ringers and sounds overall this is a great phone i did not buy the phone for the camera good thing because the camera is really [ does not work very well ] it takes decent pictures for a small screen but like i said i did not buy it for the camera pros compact size easily learnable the address book might take you a while chock full of features beautiful phone very attractive wonderful phone cons camera internal antennae no problems yet but i like external,163,27
2128,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,where can i get a new faceplate for this phone,10,28
2129,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,2.0,negative,do not buy the phone for the camera if you are looking for a great camera phone the picture quality of the samsung v205 is much better however i am disappointed with the battery life of both the motorola t722i is fast thescreen is not as bright as the samsung i can not help but compare the two however iside for apearances the motorola has twice as manny accessories and features including the desktop speakerphone and mp3 player addons so if you are into little gadgets like those it is a great phone or you can wait until the new sony erickson gets to the us which has a touch pad face and the features of both without all the addons,122,29
2130,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,pros user friendly can read the whole text in one screen cons colours should have been more attratctive battery life would have been inmproved or should have given extra battery in long run,33,30
2131,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,4.0,positive,this is my first cell phone i am quite satisfied excellent signal probably more because of t-mobile than the phone itself features are easy to learn and navigate with the accompanying manual i quite like the camera attachment it does not work well in doors it has a low light setting which gives passable results it is easy to position the camera len just right after using it a couple times of couse picture quality is not top notch but i never wanted to use it to take professional-looking photos the results i got worked for me all other features are pretty standard and as good as any of my friends phones that i had used thescreen is big and clear easy to read under strong light or in the dark it is slightly heavier than some other phones out there,139,31
2132,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,i have had the phone for a week so far it has been great need to charge the battery about every 2 days as just a phone is great calls are loud and clear and get good reception although that is mostly due to t-mobile the camera is more of a toy and the pictures are just ok but if you keep the camera attachment on your keychain then it is good to have for all those times you wish you had a camera ringtones again sound ok but the great thing is that they are just midi files so you can use t-zones to go to any site with the midis and dload rings for free and there are some great loud ones out there i have used the s105 as well it is ringtones sound nicer but are a propriatery format so can only seem to get them from t-mobile for a fee the t722is screen is not as nice and bright indoors as the s105 but it works much better in the bright sun the s105 is difficult to see text input is excellent with motorolas adaptive input just type the s and a list of the possible words are listed at the bottom most common listed first i found it to be much better than the entry of the s105 which i would usually turn of the guessing and just hit the s for the letters in the standard entry overall i highly recommend the t722i,247,32
2133,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,this phone is ok it is not definitely worth the 250 manufacturer retail theresolution is very low no wonder they give you the camera for free be aware it is not an olympus i got this phone as a gift so i do not really care because i did not pay for it if you look at this phone and you are having second thoughts please get the samsung v205,70,33
2134,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,perfect phone for me here are some of the features i like about this phone long talk time over 6 hours long stand-by time over 9 days text messaging send pictures to other phones and email addresses pictures are ok for a phone includes phonebook has voice dialing mms wap enabled it has predictive text input has a vibrate option great for movie theatres weighs less than 4 ounces and the flip design make it really compact can not even feel it in your pocket has a built in modem and calendar has megatones for music-like ring-tones great value free with rebate do not hesitate to order this from amazoncom you will not be disappointed,110,34
2135,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,forget about using the camera on this thing it is useless if you want any real quality the reception is pretty good but i have had a couple dropped calls in the first week the tmobile tzones internet restricts a lot of sites and do not plan on looking up movie times if it is raining nor checking your email the display is nice and overall it is a really cool phone an aftermarket change is definitely necessary although not yet available running around online or having it flipped over will eat the battery i have charged it 4 times in the first week,100,35
2136,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,this is by far the best phone that i have ever owned not only is it sleek and sexy it is also well equipt with a datebook phonebook coolgames internet access and very cool ringtones the camera attachment is too fun if you are going to buy any phone buy this one,54,36
2137,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,3.0,neutral,this was an ok phone do not look forward to taking many pictures with your camera because it is terrible all this phone is is a mixture of a motorola v60 and a motorola t720 it is a pretty simple phone if you have second thoughts about this phone buy the nokia 3650 or the samsung v205,56,37
2138,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,i bought this phone in january of 2003 since then I have had nothing but troubles with this phone first of all some technical shortcomings with the phone 1 phonebook you can not perform a search on phonebook scrolling tends to be very annoying 2 ringer not loud enough I have missed numerous calls because of this reason ring tones are very low quality compared to samsung s105 3 software very slow to respond to button sometime 4 screen not so good resolution camera attachment is just there to lure you in 5 antenna frequent dropped calls from low signal,102,38
2139,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,5.0,positive,I have had this phone for nearly a month now never dropped a call never had reception problems and t-mobile has awesome customer service phone interface is straight-forward and easy to use camera attachment is a fun little extra,38,39
2140,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,with my rim 7290 the hs810 is barely audible in other than a quiet setting listeners also complain about outgoing sound as muffled features and design are great but sound quality is not good enough to substitute an in-the-ear headset other than in very quiet surroundings,45,0
2141,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i love this headset not only it is light and comfortable to wear but it is also stylish the volume level is fantatic and the sound is very clear i had tried jabra bt250 and it was so staticky that i had to return it i live and work in new york city and you can hear the voice clearly even with noisy background i highly recommend this product btw my phone is sony ericsson t637,74,1
2142,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i resently purchased the hp ipaq h6315 pda / cell phone and because of it being akward to talk on i purchased this headset it was very easy to set up just follow the directions in the manuel and with in a minute i was up and running one thing i thought was interesting is that motorola used the power hook up found on most of their cell phones so if you have a motorola phone then this headset should be a given but even if you do not have a motorola device this is a good product with good battery life i found this at circuit city for 6999,107,2
2143,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,this headset was purchased to replace two crappy jabra freespeaks this is very small but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the jabra does not hide it is mass well it all sits right outside your ear and in completely inconspicuous with my old bluetrek and even the jabra my hair hid most of it which for me is a plus as i do not use bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention i do not want peoples attention and questions which is this headsets only drawback it has this huge blue orb-like light on it that takes up the whole front of the piece you will attract attention with this headset on it blinks in standby it blinks when in operation it blinks all the dang time but if you can get passed that it does work pretty well the sound is a little tinny but pretty clear and unlike all my other bluetooth headsets the headset volume only operates the headset and does not link to the phone volume this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness which is good the mic seems really good no complaints from those on the other end basically and the battery life is not too ugly at 5 hours and the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly,238,3
2144,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,this is one of the best headsets I have ever owned it is comfortable and small enough to not draw stares and questions unless it is to ask where the wires are since it is bluetooth enabled it was easy to pair with my phone and i can be in the next room and still the headset is crystal clear i highly recommend it,60,4
2145,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,this headset was a piece of junk right out of the box i had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day,27,5
2146,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,just be aware that it is not a micro connection only a mini the earpiece is a bit too long for the unfolding boom,24,6
2147,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,the mororola hs810 bluetooth headset is a piece of garbage it worked for about a week and then died,19,7
2148,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,i bought it for a sonny ericsson phone it never worked fine,12,8
2149,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,this is my first bluetooth device and I am smitten the reception is great it actually solved a reception problem at home only three very specific locations get decent cellular reception but do not accommodate me on top of my monitor on the top of the bookcase and on the west window sill using the cell phone at home was impossible until now with the bluetooth headset that is no longer an issue i leave the cell phone in one of the prime locations and I am set to chat i love the fold out microphone i prefer to have the microphone closer to my mouth maybe it is just a trick of the mind but i do not feel like i have to talk as loud for the other person to hear me with the microphone closer to myhole i really like the fact that closing the microphone turns off the headset allowing for the charge to last longer I have had no issues with the volume level seems fine to me i hear everyone just fine i use the headset when walking the dog and occasionally the wind blowing across the microphone is an issue but raising my hood solves that problem essentially i bought this model because of the price the hs850 was a bit pricier but if it truly is an improvement on this model i advise you to pick that one up instead of this one but if you are a penny pinching miser who likes the best toys this is definitely the one for you,255,9
2150,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i got my first bluetooth and did alot of research on which to buy and now i am happy with my purchase no problems at all clear voice and easy to use the only thing i feel sometimes is it is loose on the ear but may be it is just me guys and girl it is a good asset to have thanks tigerdirect and amazon,64,10
2151,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,love the ease of use and design of the headset can hear other end very clearly and they can hear my voice clearly as well very wind-resistant unit is constructed of plastic that cracks fairly easily and rubber surround has all but come off of mine but even with these problems the unit continues to function well,57,11
2152,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,we ordered the motorola hs810 headset and the charger was defective we actually ordered two products from tiger direct and both products were defective we now need to wait for tiger to contact us and wait for them to fix the problem with both products oh yes what was wrong with the other headset we ordered it was used yes somebody elses ear was wearing it and it was not a clean ear either needless to say i can not recommend this company,82,12
2153,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,well i am not that much into electronics and do not fusss as long as they work prefectly the reason i have given four stars is that the design of the headset it feels like it will fall off it hangs on but pretty precariously i can not use in crowded places for the fear of losing it otherwise the reception is excellent the voice transmission is also good it also has pretty good life can work all day,75,13
2154,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,this is a great model of bluetooth headset and you can not beat the price this model is especially easy to use with the open the boom feature to automatically connect to your phone this price is 30 cheaper than most wholesalers can get it for,45,14
2155,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,after one year using the hs810 the internal battery dies and you can not buy a replacement the ear protection rubber falls off completely requires a quiet environment for good transmission,31,15
2156,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,in general i found the volume marginal expecially in high noise environments now the mic stopped working it appears that a small blue wired gets pinched during the opening and closing of the device clearly a design flaw in the device,42,16
2157,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,i bought one of these about 6 months ago the first one i bought had problems with the button sticking i tend to be hard on electronics and figure it is because i keep it in my pocket i had it replaced and then second one worked fine until i found it in the dryer now how it got there i have no clue performance in terms of overall performance this little device is amazing it works optimally when walking indoors or in the car it does not work well in windy situations on a bike or walking in wind or in really loud trucks my friends have bought these as well and i have no troubles hearing them on the bluetooth although if they are in a loud car they can not hear me safety honestly i think they look kind of dorky but the safest device for driving I have seen much handier then just a headseat i put it on when i get in my car and never even have to touch my phone i can place and receive calls without fumbling for the phone or taking my eyes off the road i highly recommend bluetooth to anyone who phones and drives comfort i always have a difficult time finding headsets i think my ears are a non-standard size generally they just fall off and are very annoying at first i was reluctant to get one of these but it is amazingly comfortable i do not even notice it,251,17
2158,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,everything is great about this headset except how long it lasts i purchased my first hs 810 in september 2004 the plastic hinges broke after a few months but did not affect performance however after around 6 months the microphone stopped working i could hear others but they could not hear me i sent in the headset under warranty and it was replaced by motorola with the second headset the plastic hinges broke again and now just recently the microphone stopped working additionally the rubber around the earpiece used as a cushion between your ear and the headset will come lose and/or melt if you leave it in a hot environment this happened to both earpieces i loved everything else about the earpiece now if only i could get it to last,131,18
2159,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i purchased my first hs810 over a year ago it worked great the form factor is terrific the sound quality great and it worked well with the two different phones I have used since purchasing it the only problem is that the hook within the microphone that activates the headset broke within three months of my purchasing it i thought perhaps i was too rough on it carrying it in my coat pocket most of the time it was not in use motorola replaced it under warranty and i began using the new one rather than carry it in my pcoket i kept it in it is caryring case in the glove box in my car this one lasted four months before the same piece broke this time i was able to glue it back in and continue using the headset for another couple of months before it fell out somewhere in my car having had two of these break in a year i firmly believe the issue is either poor design or manufacturing too bad because this headset could be a winner if i was not having to send for a new one every few months I shall take my bluetooth headset dollars to another manufacturer,202,19
2160,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i bought this the other day and charged and linked it up whenever i use it i can hear the person i talk to very well with volume all the way up but all i hear is complaints that i sound horrible i get comments like i sound like i am in an empty room or underwater so on my end it sounds great but i guess not so great for the people i talk to they notice that it sounds better when i turn the volume down but then i can barely hear them i even got yelled at when i washed my hands they although i was blowing into the speaker i do not recommend this product even although theof having a light thing attched to your ear without wires is great also the earpiece should be bendable to fit the ear better i feel it wobble around when i move my head,153,20
2161,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,broke the second day i had it the ear thing just falls off,13,21
2162,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i have been using the hs810 for 9 months now i was initially very impressed because of the small size and it is being relatively stable with a number of different phones the early blue tooth standard is not really as standard as one might hope however it has proven rather fragile within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on / off switch did not impact usability so i did not care for the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger several of my colleagues are having similar problems the headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked i keep the unit in my briefcase so i do not know why it is proving as fragile as it has if you can use it or the similar hs850 with some assurance that it will not be crushed it is a good choice otherwise i suggest looking at other designs,166,22
2163,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,i bought this bluetooth headset for my motorola v710 phone let me just list the pros and cons for this gadget pros good design good battery life setup was easy and works fine noise cancelling is not very bad i used it outdoors and while driving the person on the other end was able to hear me ok cons the connectivity sometimes fades i hear this sometimes from the person on the other end you are breaking up when i bring my phone closer it seems to work ok i have no clue why they have given a pouch for this thing the black pouch i find no use for it i have not been able to increase or decrease the volume on the headset i use the phone instead it is kinda difficult to adjust the volume while you are talking guess that is it i am acutally thinking of returning this product but not yet decided but out of all those available in the market i would rate this product in the medium category,173,23
2164,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,the only thing i wish this headset did better was provide louder volume usually it is not a problem at all but when i am driving i always have to put the windows up to hear it properly no big thing under normal conditions it is almost perfect i love it,51,24
2165,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,i tried the platronics first it was the least expensive even although i liked the style of the bluetooth it was a bit much for my desires it was crap i talk alot on the cell a realtor and more often than not i have to switch back to the standard way of talking on the phone i am still giving it some time but i am close to trying another i also have a convertible that i have tried it in and it is terrible for that i see others driving with the top down and it looks like their having success something has to work,107,25
2166,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,i bought this with my phone from at t when it first came out i took very good care of it but with everyday usage when opening and closing it causes the unit to break due to it is housing being plastic make sure you thought of this before buying it i would rather buy the hs805 because it last longer and uses aaa battery,63,26
2167,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i purchased an hs810 headset in jan 2005 for my motorola v710 phone i have experienced seamless integration and would buy another headset still that said i am on my second hs810 after motorola replaced my first one all features of the headset still work but the microphone has quit then the second one developed the same problem motorola has yet to drop the ball they have cross shipped me an hs850 to upgrade the replacement hs810 they have never given me a hassle and both my replacements have been shipped fedex 2 day at no charge to me i feel the true measure of a company is how they act when the problem is theirs and motorola is a gem i have had no problems with my motorola cell phone i would by from motorola again with no second thoughts because as their voice mail jail warden says give us a chance and we will make it right every time i have interfaced with them they have done so i do not work for or consult for motorola and at this time i am not aware of owning any motorola stock,192,27
2168,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i picked up this headset when i got my razr v3 phone it was a package deal and was pleased initially by the headsets compact size and long battery life the folding boom makes storing the headset easy and it is instant connection to my phone could not be simpler however after only a months use the booms hinge point cracked and a small piece of plastic fell out of it the headset still works fine but I am reluctant to use it much for fear that the missing plastic chunk may make the boom loose or might allow it to break off entirely I am also not entirely fond of this headsets pusling lights to indicate power and activity they are very distracting when I am in my car at night i wear the headset on my right ear sometimes and i often catch sight of the power on pulse in the rear-view mirror it draws my eyes briefly and is just annoying the headsets audio quality is acceptable but somewhat thin voices sound tinny sometimes and if the cell phones experiencing any signal-quality problems my headset has trouble maintaining an active audio channel one big plus however is how easily the headset and phone pair up and how quickly the headset reconnects to the phone at power-on once the initial pairing is complete this headsets operation is a no-brainer this headset is a good choice if battery life is your first concern and if ease of use is next on the list,248,28
2169,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,i like the headset the sound is a little tiny but overall pretty good according to my girlfriend although she gets a lot of echo on her end when I am talking through the hs810 apparently it is tolerable for short conversations but I have been told not to use it if we are on the phone more than a few min i decided to try the lanyard over the last few days and it makes using the phone in the car really convenient normally when i get a call / two while I am driving i have to scramble to dig my phone out of my pocket with the landyard on i just open the boom and pop it on my ear a quick press of the button and I am talking super nice it worked much better with the motorola razr than it does with my current phone sprint lg slider lg-350 i think reception is only so-so and i occassionally get static when the phone is just in my pocket but i would still buy one simply because of the convenience factor,180,29
2170,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,i purchased this product because of it is convenience and price 50 the convenience of having a truly hands-free communication device is wonderful until it breaks it is even less convenient when it breaks 3 times after 2 months of using the product the plastic hinges cracked then a piece of the plastic hinge broke off now exposing any internal parts to dirt rainwhich happened to mine the first time it quit was on a rainy day when this is my guess as to what happened a drop of rain affected the microphone in which i could hear others but they could not hear me i called motorola for a return authorization spent 5 to send it fedex ground to the company and in 2 - 3 weeks i received a new one after not having this convenience product for a few weeks i used it and a crack appeared on the microphone portion within 3 - 4 weeks the rubber portion around the earpiece began to detach itself the product was still working so i kept using it then the hinges went as it did before although it was working i called motorola to find out why they have made such a poor quality product for which the retail value is around 100 their response included a return authorization so for another 5 i sent it in again and was inconvenienced for another 2 - 3 weeks it is been about two months since I have had my 3rd earpiece and the hinges cracked and now exposed it is insides today the microphone earpiece began cracking but it still works not well but it works so please read others reviews about earpieces and it is durability before purchasing as the hs810 is a wonderful product if it were to last longer than at least 6 months,297,30
2171,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,this unit works ok enough for most users except one thing you can only reliably charge it three times when the battery runs out you are supposed to shut it off and plug it in at this point the light is supposed to come on until it is charged about 2 hours after the first three times it will not come on will not charge motorola says oh we are so sorry we only have a 90 day warranty on that cingular is like oh it is over 30 days the only way i have found i can charge it turn it on wait for the I am on light to come on plug it in turn it off then it charges i suggest going with another headset,119,31
2172,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,this headset functions great decent reception cool form factor the problem is the contruction after about a week of owning it the plastic piece that covers the ear started to tear away looks like the glue came loose the next problem i had was a piece of plastic broke off of the hinge finally i notice that the case sometimes comes loose and must be snapped back together i typically carry this in my pocket so no major abuse on my part i will say with all these problems it has not affected the performance of the device at all everything continues to work properly but for a 50 - 60 earpiece I had expect better construction,114,32
2173,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i have had this headset for several months now and not liking much about this headset other than it is long battery life this headset works ok but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect ie no background or wind noise and very close to handset i do like the feature of the headset turning off when boom mike closed because that is where the battery savings comes from other than that i find nothing redeeming about this headset i believe motorola will discontinue this model because of it is severe flaws,98,33
2174,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,this works pretty well most of the time my only complaint is that it does not secure to the ear very well other users have complained that the volume is not that loud i have not experienced this i drive a loud jeep cherokee and i have used it while on the highway and have still been able to hear the conversation,61,34
2175,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,it folds up to a little tiny compact unit it is very light and comfortable to wear uses the same charger as a standard motorola phone i have 2 phones that use that charger connects fairly easily and works with non-motorola phones but it does sort of marry itself to the unit you connect to so you can have 2 different phones and use it on both without resetting it my biggest complaint i can not use it in my car the volume is so weak that i can not even come close to hearing it in my car course my car might be a little loud but i can hear my phone if i put it up to my ear,118,35
2176,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,I have been using this now for about a month and i am very happy with it quality is good and i have not had any problem with loudness or battery life I am using it with a 7520 blackberry,37,36
2177,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,it works great but the plastic is flimsy in about 8 months the first one had cracked in several places after receiving a replacement from motorola since it was still under warranty the new one lasted just a few weeks before plastic started chipping off on the hinge where the boom flips out it is great as far as technology and functionality but it is really poorly made I am not even going to both trying to get another one from motorola it is not worth the trouble for such a poorly made device,90,37
2178,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,an eighty dollar headset i did all the research and was impressed by battery life and more but when we talk about battery life we should be talking about how long it lasts also well i bought it in september 04 and it is may 2005 it does not work anymore and i take care of my things when you spend your 8000 remember it is a disposable headset i did use it although and that is why i gave it 2 stars,80,38
2179,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i purchased the hs810 after much research and i am using the headset with my motorola v551 no complaints the setup was not too difficult and once it is configured all you have to do is flip it open and you are connected reception is great volume also excellent and the range extends to about 30 feet also the battery life is excellent i can use it for at least 4 hours without charge on average i charge it once or twice a week wish i could say the same for the v551 i know two others with the headset who also like it highly recommend it,106,39
2180,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,i got my v551 so i could use the bluetooth with my computer and went looking for a headset since i already had the bluetooth i checked reviews all over the web and most were positive I have had it for 1 1/2 months and the only issue I have had is during two different calls it seemed like the volume was lower than it should have been i have it turned up all the way since i have a convertible and the road noise is pretty bad normally works pretty well would be nice if it were louder on the highway but it is fine in stop and go or city traffic or walking around,113,40
2181,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,what has in the box [ was not all there ] motorola hs810 bluetooth headset neck strap travel charger carry case user manual and quick start guide my order did not have a carry case or neck strap and it is unclear to me how to report this back to amazon their process of communicating with them about an order is seriously flawed also when i ordered thisi also ordered two car chargers the promise date was changed significantly without amazon telling me or sending my hs810 ahead [ since it was in stock ] and absorbing the extra shipping cost since the problem was one that they created i placed my order on 4/11 and it arrived a few minutes ago [ 4/28 ] amazons quality assurance and customer service have dropped significantly in the last year and i will look seriously for other vendors who have a higher customer service level and who deliver what is offered without the hassle required for the customer to get what they ordered in a timely manner,170,41
2182,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i recently purchased this headset through amazoncom and i have been very pleased with it is performance i can leave the phone on my bed and speak from my bathroom over 20 feet away the headset feels solid and is very light weight it fits my ear well and has not ever fallen off i was afraid to buy it beacuse of the 2 reviews written by people who siad they purchased it and it broke however i highly doubt this headset will break if you handle it with care of course if you mistreat any product it is going to break but i believe that this is one of the sturdiest headsets i have ever used and feel that it will last a long time with proper care the audio quality is perfect and i have not heard anyone tell me otherwise i am using this product with the motorola a630 so your experience may be different from mine overall i belive this is a good wireless purchase and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a stylish bluetooth headset and has 60 they are willing to spend,188,42
2183,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,i purchased this for use with the motorola v551 phone as a hands-free headset i have no problem synching the phone and the headset and it is only dropped calls once or twice sound quality is fair it is nothing good enough to play music over but it is clear and i can understand what people are saying unfortunately the unit feels very flimsy it is light and made of plastic the ear clip pinches if you use the headset for any length of time it uses a series of beeps to communicate everything which can be confusing did that series of beeps mean i have an incoming call or that my battery is running out there are two buttons for volume and one button for well everything else answering and hanging up are pretty simple just push the button accessing any of the other functions requires button morse code it is difficult to get he unit into it is belt holster which tends to fall off your belt ovaerall I had say this is a serviceable unit but it could use some design improvements,174,43
2184,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i purchased the hs810 to use with my motorola v600 on t-mobile i have been a huge motorola fan since the startac and been very happy with their products i have used a variety of corded headsets from motorola plantronics and jabra was very skeptical about the hs810 from pictures and did not think it would be comfortable to wear what a product the headset takes a little getting used to on the ear but it is totally amazing paired with my v600 the sound quality is perfect my longest wear was 1 1/2 hours in the car and could not tell it was on some reviewers have had problems with other phone manufacturers my boss uses one with the treo 650 on cingular and he is very happy with it i use headsets alot and now to be totally wireless is awesome my headset cord was always getting caught in my seatbelt or on my coffee cup in the holder in the car not anymore the headset paired up with the v600 immediately and both work seamless together the v600 has voice dial for names in the phonebook and nothing is better will never go back to corded earbuds,201,44
2185,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,this brand of bluetooth earpiece does not provide a snug fit to the ear more particularly for a womans ear which is smaller try using a wrap around unit that goes down the back of the ear as opposed to across the top as this one does the hs810 literally fell from my ear if i tilted my head and never had a good fit even sitting still i would recommend another blue tooth option jabra has a nice one,80,45
2186,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,1.0,negative,i generally give good reviews for electronics that i buy mainly because I am such a tech geek in this case however i am forced to write a negative review i purchased the motorola hs810 bluetooth headset from my local cingular shop for use on my lg pm327 phone by sprint the first thing i noticed was a huge delay in sound there is a three second delay for me in what i say going to the phone the second and most annoying issue was that of echo the other caller complained about echo sounds even when i had the speaker turned down so low i could barely hear the caller and needed to ask them to repeat every other sentence i owned this device for three days and gave up my local shop will exchange it for a jabra bluetooth device I shall be sure to review it also hopefully that review will be positive I shall reserve a review of my bluetooth phone until i find a headset that works well with it the bottomline do not buy the motorola hs810 headset it is poorly designed crap motorola should pull it from the market if they have not already i noticed it was so cheap they pulled it from their website,209,46
2187,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i have paired the head set with both my computer and phone both work great with the head set the phone that i am using is a motorola v3 and it works great it takes a couple seconds to connect but you have enough time to connect the two and answer the call before it goes to voice mail if you are going to use a head set with a phone alot i would sugest using one that supports voice commands like digit dial to keep you from having to store voice dails for everyone you want to call next i have also paired it to my computer to a cheep bluetooth adaptor that i bought just to sync a palm i have not used the mic yet but i am sure that it will work great as it does with the phone on both phone and computer sound is great i have not had any problem hearing on either one this one seems to be getting mixed reviews so it may not work on your set up but you never know till you try this headset is small and light weight so i would atleast have to try it out,201,47
2188,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,for using it with my nokia 3650 and any other s60 phone it is great the 810 is compatable with pretty much anything from what my studies show this design also is nice for a easy on and off function compaired to the 820 this is better the 820 does not have a flip open design so you can not easily turn it on you need to push the button which is annoying i rather open the mic and it be ready for me for talking on the phone it is great however for doing everything else listening to movies musicthis headset sucks sound levels are off distorted and so making the wired headsets better however i do use my headset daily and well could not live without it also since mine came with a car charger too it is perfect the carrying case has never sliped on me either when i latch it to my belt comes with a neck strap too but i never use it so if your looking for a nice device to rely on this would be the one never had any problems yet and hope i never will now if only motorola would make a better plug charger hate this 3 pin one normally those will break sometime down the line it seems hope mine does not,218,48
2189,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,I have had my unit for a little over a week and i have been able to use it pretty extensively in that time so far it has been great i have paired it up with my v710 and it worked like a charm sound quality is just as good as any wired headset I have used on either end the best thing for me is the cool factor it has i like the little blue led light which can be turned off on a per-call basis because it doubles as a locating device when i drop it in my car it also matches nicely with my phone since they are both motorola so it is all coordinated well my only gripe is that the unit is a little side-heavy and the over-the-ear hook does not really fit snugly over my ear it has not actually fallen off but it does feel like it might sometimes it might just be because i have small ears but i think they could have made the spring a tad bit tighter i guess one advantage is that you almost do not even feel like anything is on your ear which is great for the tender-eared people all in all i am very happy with this unit and would definitely buy it again,213,49
2190,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,i can not say enough good about the hs810 headset i use it with my motorola v600 great sound quality however like todd from houston after 3 months the plastic hinge where the boom mike flips out broke off i have one small piece holding it together and when that goes I am sure mine will stop working as well sloppy design for such an awesome product,67,50
2191,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i bought this several months ago when i purchased a new blackberry 7100 although the sound quality is somewhat marginal i was quite happy with the design and willing to put up with lower sound quality for the compact wireless design unfortunately after two weeks the plastic on the inside of the boom mic started to break off i noticed that simply opening the boom would catch part of the plastic on the hinge causing the plastic to bend and eventually break after a few more months all of the plastic on the inside of the boom was gone a couple of weeks later the unit stopped working completely as others have noted the belt case clip is poorly designed and frequently slips off i lost the headset several times once i had to run back into a theater and search under seats in the dark to find it the headset comes with a very compact charger but not a car charger i would often run the battery low and have to revert back to a good ole wired headset there is really no excuse for the quality and belt clip problems especially with the high price of the unit it is too bad too because it really is a very nice designmotorolla just needs to improve the quality of the sound and construction,226,51
2192,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,i was able to get better incoming and outgoing sound quality with a 24 jabra wave boom,17,52
2193,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,what I have learned is that certain bluetooth headsets work better with different phones i used a jabra set with the 7100 at first because that is what the t-mobile store recommended it was a frustrating experience with dropped calls and problems getting synched and staying synched with the motorola hs810 it synchs up and works like a dream the flip open boom to turn on and off is a wonderful feature i get some crackling in heavy wifi noise environments my office has 5 different wireless lans within range and many cordless phones when i use it but overall it is fantastic definite buy if you have a blackberry,109,53
2194,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i purchased this headset so i could use it with my motorola v551 the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature so far i have no complaints about the sound quality very clear and people on the other end are surprised when i tell them that I am using a bluetooth headset no problems with sound quality while driving as well this device will attract attention in a good way you will get questions about it from friends and strangers the range is very decent I have been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception / sound quality issues this is a great product so far this is my second product from motorola both my cell phone and headset a such great quality products that they may have made themselves a loyal customer out of me or a least a great fan of their products,166,54
2195,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,i bought this headset a few days ago i am using it with my motorola mpx220 it connected easily to the phone which was not an issue the one problem i have with the phone and not the headset is that voice recognition dialing is not supported by the phones os one point to make is that the bluetooth connection between the phone and the headset takes about 5 - 7 seconds to connect the issue with this is that when the phone rings with an incoming call and you pick up the headset and extend the mouth piece it may not connect in time to answer the call i have had this issue a few times i love the freedom of the wireless headset but the sound quality is okay you can definitely hear some crackling or popping at times if you like to be unteathered but willing to sacrifice some sound quality then this is the headset a friend of mine purchased the hs820 and did not like it due to the fact that it turns it self on when in his pocket due to now have the mouth piece flip option,191,55
2196,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,when i did have this headset the sound quality on my end was good battery life was excellent as was the range the other person always said there was an echo when i was talking to them the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all it was always a task to get it around my ear quickly and even then it did not feel secure although it never did fall off my biggest problem with it was the belt clip since it came off when i was walking and i lost the headset i have had cell phone belt clips and pager clips which have never come off i feel as if it was a design flaw or perchance a fluke overall i did not like the feel of this headset,137,56
2197,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,3.0,neutral,i have had this product for a month i am using it with the moto razr v3 it works well and is easy to use it is also fairly comfortable my problem is that the rubber earpiece fell apart it provides a cushion for your ear it would be easy to replace it simply snaps on and off i called motorola to order some i figured a dozen would last me a year i was told that they do not sell the earpiece separately since it is in warranty the only way i can fix it is to ship it to them and they will then ship me a new one so i have to go without it for about 2 weeks if the next earpiece lasts as long as the first one I shall be without the headset 2 weeks out of 4 while it is being replaced hello moto get a clue sell me replacement earpieces,156,57
2198,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,5.0,positive,i have a blackberry 7100 t and it took me about 30 seconds to get up and running with this bluetooth headset i actually took this recommendation from another 7100 t user and i am glad i followed his advice since i have no patience for installation hassles while i have had great experience installing and using this device that is not to say you will have the exact same experience when you try to use this headset with your bluetooth phone so do ask around or read reviews at amazon or elsewhere on the web to find out the headset that is known to work well with your phone if this particular headset passes this test and has been reported by others to work well with your particular phone go ahead and order the sound clarity is great and the unit is very lightweight you hardly notice you have it on,150,58
2199,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,for the most part this product lives up to the hype i bought this headset to use with my phone and laptop the headset worked perfectly with my v600 the included documentation was pretty good for the phone / headset combo on the other hand to get it to work with the laptop i had to go through a few number of hoops for the usb / bluetooth dongle but also with the headset / xp2 setup in the end the catch was that i could not use the xp2 drivers for the dongle you must manually direct the program to use the included cd drivers and that you need to specify in the sound options the use of bluetooth audio microphone instead of your onboard sound card once i got things up and running there was no problem with audio / voice quality on either end using skype if you need more specific details there are web sites decribing the setup by the way the headset ear piece is a lot more delicate than i thought as it seems to be made of somewhat weak rubber like material,181,59
2200,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,12/19/2004 i just got this phone yesterday i love the reception and the sound quality is excellent my only grip is that you can not have multiple number per contact i had my numbers transferred from the lg6000 i had 100 contacts home and cell for each now i have 200 people in my phonebook oh well i bought this phone as a direct result of all the headset / hand free laws that passed in each state while driving I shall use this for a while with the speakerphone my next purchase is going to be the bluetooth headset,96,0
2201,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,i bought this phone in july from radio shack rs the main reason was to pair with my acura tl poor reception dropped calls static poor bluetooth abilities does not work on incoming calls in my tl communicated with rs moto and vz all three told me it was acura acura refers me to handsfree link verizon never gave them the phone for testing before moving this to production this is done with all other wireless companies rs exchanged the phone in sept oct i find that it is not the car but the phone vz bluntly told me it is my problem discuss it with rs rs said discuss it with moto moto states that they know there is a problem with the bluetooth but do not know how to distribute the fix no one will refund me the price of the phone that i bought outright and paid in excess of 400 because it is now over 30 days old i travel nationwide and have the same reception problems in all parts of the country my qualcom from 1997 and my nokia from 2001 perform better then this phone poor picture abilities can not transfer files form phone to my laptop using bluetooth as vz disabled this i will write off the phone and have my company switch me to cingular,222,1
2202,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i have been through all the cell companies t-mobile cingular at t sprint and now verizon and am happy with this phone all of the gsm phones would drop calls when i was in buildings and on the road this phone has yet to drop a call my last phone was the all in one ipaq phone that had the best feature set of any phone but what good was that if the calls dropped so i got this one and am happy the bluetooth works great with my headset and as a modem for my laptop i wish it did data transfer but that is not a deal breaker for me loss of important calls was i got the transflash off amazon for a great deal and love that ability to shuttle data between my laptop pda and phone with it all in all i am please with this phone,150,2
2203,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i traded my vx6000 for this phone this phone has been getting fairly bad reviews across the board stemming from the lack of bluetooth support from verizons end people think that you can not get information to and from the phone other than emailing back and forth but they are wrong i bought a 128 mb transflash card and a sd reader for 40 bucks total i do not have anything that can send bluetooth signals anyway so the fact that i had to buy a separate reader was not an issue i can send pictures and ringtones to and from the phone without verizon charging me the only problem with mp3 ringtones is that you have to save them to the phones internal memory so you have to chop them down and lower the quality to keep more than a few the transflash card itself is worth the extra cost of this phone i can grab pictures off the computer to use as wallpaper or as a contact identification again for free the camera is more worthless than my vx6000 indoors but outside it takes fairly decent pictures overall it is not as bad as people want you believe but i only paid 150 bucks for it after rebates and incentives,207,3
2204,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,as a phone it is ok the volume even at it is highest setting is too low it is got lots features like voice dial speaker phone most you probably will not use as a camera even although it is advertised as 12 megapixels the pictures and video are pretty worthless bluetooth 99 worthless i did not know much about bluetooth before i bought the phone so i assumed i could use bluetooth from my pc to wirelessly send pictures ringtones mp3s phonebooks and syncronize my phone up to my pc not true bluetooth has a bunch of different profiles and this phone only supports a very small number of them mostly for using the phone as a modem or with a wireless headset overall save your money and buy a less expensive phone i bought 2 of these and i like my old startacs better,148,4
2205,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,avoid this phone i had one for a year then it went dead verizon sold me a new battery but that was not the problem after four trips to the store they fedexd me a new refurbished phone which also went dead after a few weeks they gave me a third one which also went dead so they gave me a fourth phone this morning always the same problem the screen says unable to charge verizon can not explain what that means but it must be more than a problem with the battery or charger because they keep giving me a new or refurbished phone of this same model i do not know much about cell phones other than there must be better ones than this,124,5
2206,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,make sure you read what the bluetooth profile is actually capable of doing for the carrier you are using for example verizon wireless i purchased this phone on line at almost no cost due to a promotion what i neglected to do is read the actual blue tooth profile the phone is capable of doing to much shock due to my ignorance my phone was actually crippled by my carrier with the exception of blue tooth wireless headsets anyway I am now on my 3rd phone and was upgraded to a motorola e815 i was constantly experiencing problems of unable to charge well at least after many trips to verizon wireless they at least took care of me it is amazing how many people have the same problem w / motorola phones i noticed this while waiting at the tech support counter for my address book to be transferred oh yeah forget the 12 megapixel camera it is truly crappy and worthless co-workers first impression of the phone is that it looks very cheap it is not all bad news however the phone has an additional memory slot for transflash card this is a wonderful feature if your computer is capable of handling transflash cards you can basically transfer your pictures videos and music files directly to you computer and vice versa at no additional monthly charge i love the speaker phone feature which i prefer over the blue tooth wireless headsets the alarm clock feature truly wakes me up in the morning as long as you program it with a truly absurd ring tone that is great news if you are travelling,266,6
2207,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had this phone for one year at the time i thought it was a great-looking phone with plenty of features after one year i still think it is a pretty decent phone but definitely not as attractive as some newer ones on the market i agree with other reviewers that the camera is not that great i guess on the plus-side the phone does hold a lot of the images similarly it holds a decent amount of ringtones and the ringer speaker is prety loud depending on the ringtone of course i do not use the bluetooth feature so i can not comment on it overall I am pleased with this phone at the time it was 100 or so which i think to be a fair price from my experience with this phone however i will next purchase something without an antenna this is in my opinion the biggest complaint i have as it looks and feels very cheap,158,7
2208,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i bought this phone with thoughts of a great camera and reliable phone i have yet to see either of them after the first month the internal screen went all white after a period of the phone sutting off randomly I am on my second phone the phone just seems very flimsy also the camera is absolutly the worst camera i have ever seen on a camera phone i know it is just a phone and not a digital camera but i would expect that pictures would be somewhat decent especially becuase this phone boasts a 12 megapixel camera very misleading this phone is soo bad i am contemplating paying the 175 cancellation fee and leaving verizon since the bastards will not let me switch models for the very highly rated slvr and cingular,131,8
2209,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i got this phone in june it worked great all summer and i snapped fairly decent shots with it then in october it decided it did not want to take half my calls and it did not store my pictures anymore so verizon gave me another v710 and it worked pretty well then in january my second v710 stopped saving pictures again so they gave me a third one if my phone stops working agian i will get down on my hands and knees and beg for a different model but besideds that the battery life is great i play games txt and talk all day and by the time i go to bed i still have full battery life,118,9
2210,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,this phone is pretty reliable and easy to use it has useful featueres such as bluetooth and a built in camera on occasion it needs to be turned off and on to communicate via bluetooth properly with other devices for example headset palm computer this phone does not support obex which means the phone can not sync contact lists with your computer or palm device the data transfer is 1xrtt and not evdo as in the e815 however unlike the motorola e815 it can use the analog network as well in case you are in a rural area or if the network is busy for example around new year or potentially some type of disaster the phone also has a convenient speakerphone feature two types of batteries are available in addition to the standard battery the extended battery which is twice as big requires that a larger battery door be placed on the phone overall i wish that they would have been a bit more careful with the software design but i would definitely buy the phone again,176,10
2211,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,my husband purchased 2 of these phones for each of us we have had for over a year and it constantly gives us problems the battery life is very short the battery on his phone lasts only a few hours and he does not even use it that much i have a problem with the bluetooth for my car lately the phone does not ring at all in the car so i miss all my calls this phone needs alot of improvement i only gave it 3 stars because verizon service is reliable the phone has many functions and it is easy to use but as far as reliable that it is not do not buy this phone not worth the money,119,11
2212,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,to start out i would like to say that this phone was a problem from the day i got it it is plagued with annoying bugs some pretty big the phone has terrible battery life of about 30 minutes of talk time and two days of standby time when i bought it i knew the battery was not great but i thought it would be better than what i am experiencing the phone periodically blacks out while you are doing the simplest things like browsing your contacts and photos which brings me to my next point the camera is absolutely horiffic in moderate to low light to get a halfway decent picture you must take photos outside in very good light also transfering photos and videos to your computer is a big pain because verizon crippled the bluetooth functionality only letting you use it for headsets now you must buy a 40 transflash card or email them to your computer for 025 / message it is latest problem of many is that it will not let me delete or transfer pictures to my memory card so i can not take anymore photos or even send them to anyone this phone does not even deserve one star update now it will not even charge and does not acknowledge a call update ii now the charger only works some of the time battery will not allow me to make a call for more than ten minutes and more I have had 2 motorola phones both have been the worst phones I have ever had,251,12
2213,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i purchased this phone just over a year ago and i have to say that it has served me well verizons network is extremely reliable i can not remember the number of times I have had service when friends of mine with other providers did not and they had to use my phone to make calls the pics are not great quality but that is what i own a camera for to take spur of the moment pics to send friends it is fine as far as the bluetooth issue goes it has not bothered me any because i do not have a need for it but it is something to consider the one complaint i do have and I am beginning to think this is a general motorola problem especially after reading some of the other reviews is the battery this is the second motorola I have purchased that after about 8 months to a year the battery loses charge after only a few hours even if the phone is not in use I am not sure if the problem lies in the battery or in the connection for the charger because i do notice sometimes my phone is plugged in and not actually charging i still prefer motorolas over other brands available because of the style and text messaging options but i would highly recommend purchasing the insurance for 5 bucks a month just in case unless you purchase the phone for less than the 50 dollar deductible,238,13
2214,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i am now on my second v710 the first one got wet and the screen went dead it seems that verizon and motorola have updated the v710 before they discontinued it and the phone is better than ever for the price amazoncom is offering this phone with the rebate you can not miss this opportunity i have never had a problem with using bluetooth on this phone and the picture quality is very good this is a great cellphone,78,14
2215,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,this is the phone that made verizon start telling you that they were crippling bluetooth they have settled a lawsuit and while the policy continues with newer phones bluetooth to headsets and such only not for file transfer to your palm or pc they would rather charge you send yourself pictures at least they tell you about it now,56,15
2216,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,overall this phone is great but it has it is flaws the reception is flat out amazing the camera stinks and many 1 megapixel cameras are better than this one the large screen is totally awesome and i really love that about the phone the lcd screen in the front is sufficient for a second screen overall i really love this phone even after 8 months of use the battery life is also great and i have never really run out of battery when i really needed it if you are looking for a fair-priced phone i really think you should look into the v710 i thought it was a great buy thanks for reading my review,116,16
2217,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,let me start by saying i love my phone that being said there are some features people may be looking for in a phone that it just does not have first it is bigger and heavier than any other camera phone you are going to find out there the picture quality is crap compared to other 1 megapixel camera phones also the camera does not have a flash it has a crappy light which is pretty much only good for finding your bluetooth it is definitely disabled i do not have any accessories but i do have bluetooth in my apple ibook i can make a 144 internet connection but that is it the phone does not work with isync and files can not be transfered via bluetooth there was a class action lawsuit over this and to be honest i will probably be getting a new phone soon if i can keep my v710 i will although because like i said i do love it,160,17
2218,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,generally this phone is fine the pics are awful that might need to be fixed although otherwise it is fairly easy to use,22,18
2219,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,the motorola v710 is an amazing piece of work to look at that is about it when the screen decides to work it awes greatand graphical display the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors I had rather be using a disposable then this the worst part about the phone by far is the charger i have to jiggle the cord around wrap it around objects then pray and sometimes it will work the sales reps spoke of it as if it were the second coming of jesus but they must have been lied to as well,102,19
2220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,this is a great phone in terms of reception there are some design flaws if carrying the phone in a bag it is easy to inadvertently hit the record button or to lower the sound of the ringer there are limited ringers that come with the phone and it is difficult if not impossible to download ringers without buying verizons get it now package or hacking into the phone the camera is useless for indoor shots the bluetooth feature is only useful for a headset verizon has made it impossible to sync it with your computer it is a nice looking phone if a bit long the keyboard is odd you can list multiple numbers for each entry and that is a plus,122,20
2221,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i got this phone because it had the best reception reviews and was compatible with the best locally provider the reception is good which is why i got it so i do not really care that the camera is below mediocre the evil verizon disabled it is connectivity and the batterys only good for one day but it keeps losing audio when you try to make a call it is not a network issue it connects okay but neither party gets any sound i ordered two phones one was really bad so i exchanged it now the same s t is happening with the other original and the replacement it is possible that this is a verizon only issue their store tech support is absolute garbage although their telephone customer service people are models of polite helpfulness go figure and denied there was any problem because they could not reproduce it after a couple of test calls i give up i just want a reliable phone to make phone calls but it does not exist if you look at all phone reviews at least 1 in 8 is very negative no mfr has good quality control and the development outpaces testing just like microsoft the bane of my work life take home message never get a 2-year contract for any phone or any provider that way you can look forward to retrying the phone lottery in reasonable time,234,21
2222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,the battery is not good actually is very short only last two days it is not consistent with it is ad,20,22
2223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone about a month ago and found it is very good i like the camera and it can also record short video clips i bought a bluetooth headset for my v710 so that i can talk with hand free the main issue is about the voice dial when i try to call some of my friends with chinese or indian name it is really difficult to be recognized i have to try again and again to guess what the phone will pronounce them although the voice dial feature is non-specific person speech recognition so that we do not need to train the recognizor why not also proivdes some method for the user to hear the target name pronounciation in the other words if the user can not train the recognizer why not let the recognizer train the user i still have several friends which i do not know how my v710 will pronounce their names so that i can not call them by voice dial another issue is about the life of the battery it can only last two days after fully charged considering it has doublescreens i can somewhat accept this although it is really troublesome to charge the phone every two days,206,23
2224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,verizon has disabled the bluetooth file transfer and the file transfer from transflash so you have to subscribe to their extra services over the cell network which they also charge for your airtime to transfer files and programs even mp3 music files totally defeats the purpose of buying this phone with bluetooth,52,24
2225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,pros incredible reception crystal clear call quality 12 megapixel camera w / flash digital camcorder w / up to 3 minutes of video and sound sleek sexy executive look got to love that black over silver good speaker phone awesome voice recognition rock solid construction fully functional bluetooth w / alltel easy accessible menus perfect sized white lit smart keypad this thing actually senses ands turns off when there is enough light mp3 player and fm stereo headset beautiful doubledisplay internal / external with a total of six different colors also featuring a huge bright internal screen tons of preloaded wallpaper and screen savers too many features to name cons weak vibrate i assume this is to preserve battery life so so camera at night in night mode the camera takes mediocre pics even with the flash on it takes forever to configure the right setting so my suggestion is read the manual and play around and see what you can come up with a bit better than average battery life rated at 3 hours of talk time i highly recommend the extended life which lasts for about 5 1/2 hours surface scratches rather easily instruction manual is a little bit confusing in some aspects conclusion this is the best phone i have ever owned i would not own another phone,198,25
2226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have been very impressed with this phone ever since i bought it a few months ago definitely worth getting paid 25 for pros reception / voice quality decent camera for the daytime it is a phone with a tiny appature not a 500 camera built like a rock i would have destroyed a lesser phone several times by now large external and internal display high quality internal lcd screen comfortable to hold transflash card slot quality voice recognition intuitive menus and feature layout cons foolish initial ringtones verizons greed crippled pic / mp3 xfer however this can be fixed heavy low capacity battery / short life battery indicator does not decrease linearly ok keypad,107,26
2227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i have owned this phone since december 2004 while i do appreciate many of it is features this phone falls short on some very important basic functions 1 battery life as mentioned by many is terrible 2 the flimsy plug-in phone charger and where it connects into the phone is quite testy and i fear it is on it is way to failing completely when it does work it takes forever to charge 3 humidity severely affects this phone if hands are even slightly damp / sweaty or it is humid outside which is the case nearly all summer in new jersey the display turns off 4 this phone constantly turns itself all the way off and the only way to get it to turn back on is to remove the battery put it back in and hold the power button for about 15 seconds 5 motorolas instruction booklet for this phone is possibly the worst i have ever seen pathetic 6 i do not get great reception with this phone at all now this could be my carriers fault something that makes no sense having one of the largest carriers in the nation living in the most densely populated state in the nation and receiving such horrible service 7 i do not want a refurbished used phone when i go in for help either fix the phone i have or give me a new one with no problems i do not want a phone that already has problems because guaranteed they have not fixed the problem they just cleaned it up and put it in a new box these few things are enough for me to want to throw this motorola out the window and never look back these are basic issues and for the price the phone should work period overall disappointed,304,27
2228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,ha just purchased it and now at verizon stores it is not available ne more so i guess this phone is obsolete now great phone although pros reception speaker phone white led lit colored keypad at night cons keypad very difficult to use at times feels like one layer of cheap plastic features are not all that great can not transfer mp3 via pc camera is ok looks really generic now people assumes it is just a 50 when it is not over all it is a great phone when used as a phone other than that features and what not does not seem to be as great as advertised,105,28
2229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,was a little apprehensive reading some mixed reviews on this phone here glad i went ahead i switched from tmobile / sonyericsson t610 to verizon / motorola v710 what a world of difference if i had known earlier i would have left tmobile mid-way and paid the contract cancellation fee it is that significant not sure how much is the phone how much is the carrier but the whole experience has been transformed from an annoyance to a delight the keypad is fun to punch the speakerphone is loud and clear folks on the other end think i am in the same room and no dropped calls everywhere even insideetc can not comment about camera video web browsing and more had all of those in my previous phone too they are distractions at best much prefer my 7mp camera and my 15 laptop screen for those,142,29
2230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,oh my god do not buy this phonei have gone through eight of these phones and they all have the same problems crappy camera freezing up texts will not send for several minutes will not charge half the time and the battery life sucksi had to charge it twice a day,41,30
2231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,this phone has nice features a large screen a great speakerphone and a decently loud ringer the battery life is horrible although although maybe it should be expected because of the large screen size do not bother with this phone if you want the bluetooth capability because verizon disable all of useful bluetooth features leaving you with wireless headset only it is a nice phone but not worth the price,68,31
2232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is a fantastic phone i just downloaded voice genesis email on it and it let us me reply to my emails by voice this is sooooooo cool it is fast and let us me access the various email accounts i have too much nicer phone than the pda / phones better connection anyways buy it download voice genesis on it and you will have a great phone that can work like a pda,68,32
2233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i love the phone except either is the battery problem or that is the way of the battery even i fully charge for more than 3 hours fully charge it still did not last for a full day other than that it is a great phone,44,33
2234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i received the phone very quickly and i just love it it does almost everything i love all the features and especially love all the rebates thanks,27,34
2235,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have previously owned the v400 v525 v600 and now the v710 i am definitely glad i switched this was the nicest and most reliable phone out of those my only complaint with these verizon phones is with the antenna size,41,35
2236,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,this is a great phone it is extremely clear when making calls and is has greatscreen a transflash slot and can play mp3s and movies converted in 3gp so why is it a four star because verizon crippled it is blue tooth capabilities do not expcept full bluetooth capabilites to work but this is still a really good phone,59,36
2237,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i use a cell phone well to make and receive calls i do not really care that much about the other features i want the calls to be clear quick and hands-free i chose the v710 because it was the only bluetooth option offered by verizon i did not want to tear up my brand new roadster to talk hands-free so the headset was the perfect alternative the phone paired with the motorola hs 850 makes for clear calls even with the top down i do not use the phone for business for an average walking / riding around cell phone user the v710 does work for me,101,37
2238,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i must say that this phone has a few negatives one the keypad two the outer rim of the keypad is very flimsy and three the camera will not work in lowlight situations now these are all worthwhile sacrifices to the current price of the phone 2500 after rebate however if you plan to buy this phone at retail price i would stray from thatget the lg vx7000 or vx8000 instead those are more solid phones btw the reception with verizon wireless and this phone is very clear and speaker phone works just fine it is been about two months since i have owned this phone and whenever i open or close the flip phone feature the sides rub against the bearings making an old door creaking sound and the area located above the camera lens the black part of the phone gets scratched after i open it because it rubs against something on the inside or the grey rubber part can anyone else comment or confirm these two problems on my phone that would be much appreciated,178,38
2239,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i have owned the v710 for about 7 weeks now and it works most of the time but i would be happier with less dropped calls better reception i would have especially been happier if the rep at verizon told me to wait a few weeks for the upgraded version the e815 which just came out last week it fixes the issue with the keyboard layout the speaker phone works better it has more ringtones and also more built-in memory and for those who want a better camera the e815 works better my girlfriend has the newer one and hers wins hands down and to top it off it is the same price on verizons website verizon will not do anything for me since it is past the 15 day trial period and from what i understand they do not care if i am happy or not just that they have me wrapped up in a 2 year plan with the sub-par phone if you are a techie geek like i am get the newer model you will be happier,176,39
2240,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is a mid-priced phone with solid features all-around including bluetooth good reception nice compact size and good battery life if you buy it with those expectations you will be very happy with it compared to the higher-end phones although it has some drawbacks I have had it for a few months pros reliable very good reception an improvement over prior phone from a couple years ago compact bluetooth works with headphones and car not with pda photos and movies these are just novelty features to me but they work I have sent little video clips I have taken to another phone kind of cute loud ringer web browsing cons web browsing is pretty slow and limited the organizer features are not great the add-on motorola tools software for connecting to outlook is kind of clunky the cons are relative to what you would get on a higher end more expensive phone like a microsoft win-ce enabled phone if you compare to similar price-point phones this one is a very good value,178,40
2241,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i got this phone after having used both a motorola v600 and v551 on cingular it is better than both verizon service in los angeles is much better than cingular for starters but the v710 is better than the other phones too first the screen is huge and bright better than the others and like the v551 but unlike the v600 when using the phone with a bluetooth headset the phone will ring in addition to the headset which is a huge plus the negatives the keypad is lousy the camera is lousy the external disply does not show the time when not lit and the phone is larger than the gsm models but those are all worthwhile sacrifices for better service and for all of the complaining about the crippled bluetooth it is not a big deal at all using mobile phonetools you can still sync your phonebook with outlook using bluetooth bluetooth headsets also work great the only bluetooth loss is the ability to transfer ringtones not such a big deal if you ask me this phone has just been replaced by the motorola e815 for the price difference I had get the v710 the newer one addresses all of the negatives mentioned but at a 125 price premium which just does not seem worth it and you loose analog in the new one which only matters if you travel in the middle of nowhere often at the end of the day if verizon has the best service in your area this phone is a steal at it is current price you can disregard all reviews older than feb 2005 since the phone had a lot of issues that were corrected with a revision around that date earpiece volume and more,287,41
2242,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,my title says it all i have been to three different verizon stores trying to get these items corrected but keep getting directed elsewhere when the phone works it is nice but half of the time my phone does not ring the ring is too soft even when set to loud and the battery life is bad,56,42
2243,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,caveat this phone is pretty good but verizon has limited the bluetooth capabilities to supporting a headset only in other words if you want to get a file ie photos addresses messages into or out of the phone you can not use bluetooth to transfer them to or from your computer you must either pay to e-mail them buy the software / usb cable or the extra memory card and card reader i would have returned the phone but i did not buy the bluetooth fob until after the trial period was over I have written to verizon but always get a corporate doublespeak letter in return and the problem remains,106,43
2244,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is the top-of-the-line there has so much to explore in this little phone and a ton of features this will take you hours to find all of the little offerings this phone packs great phone a,38,44
2245,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is great i think that sometimes what is supposed to be a forum for peoples opinions turns out to be the place where the people go that are frustrated with everything in life the phone works fine great features i do not know what some of these people are whining about customer service is second to none i have to say that i have never been treated so well as a customer than by verizonwireless for example my wife and i updated our phones via phone the first person i talked to was not really helping so the trick is call back it usually works the next person was soo nice she gave us the phones with an added discount for us she could sent them overnight and threw in an extra holster for each of us admittedly this was because the initial order had been stopped for some unknown reason so to make up for it the nice lady did all that now if you have dealt with any kind of business in the last 20 years you can count on one hand how many treat you well enough for you to remember am i right well we all they all make mistakes understanding that is the firstto becoming a much happier and more satisfied customer would not you agree anyway enough of the counseling for all the whiners out there the phone is great what do you want something that you can not possibly find wrong with it it will not happen adapt and overcome semper fi try to oysters matt,261,45
2246,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had the phone for about a month now i switched from tmobile with a sony ericsson phone to verizon because of coverage issues the v710 is not a bad phone but nothing mind blowing either the signal is pretty much always strong even compared to other verizon users the screen is bright and nice looking accessories are available and are not too expensive either expansion card are cheap picked a 256 mb for 30 it allows me to transfer ringtones and store mp3s and pictures bluetooth is indeed somewhat crippled but there are some bypass to bring them to the phone for free works pretty well with motorola bt headset clear signal and hopefully I shall get it to work with my pc bt adapter soon battery life with the factory battery blows you will get a day or two at most on a stock battery my t68 would last almost a freaking week the 1500ma extended battery will last 3 - 4 days which is a bit more acceptable but is bulkier than the factory unit still fit in the holster although which is nice i guess this is a trade-off for a nice and brighter screen phone size not the smallest form factor out there advantage is that the keys are easily accessible and you will not screw up dialing the number even while doing other stuff voice dialing one of the coolest feature no need to train your phone for every name in your contact list just speak it up and it will recognize and dial the name i love this feature more than anything even the razor does not have that bottom line the phone is not bad not sure it is worth 200 but around 150 after rebate is not a bad deal just make sure you pick a travel charger or car adapter,298,46
2247,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,so i switched from t-mobile to verizon and am quite happy with the signal and coverage verizon truly does have the best coverage around the san francisco bay area the motorola v-710 phone stood out as a sleak and sexy piece compared to all other phones that verizon carried it has an amazingscreen and fantastic reception if you are looking for a great phone with basic features i suggest you get it at this amazingly low price but i wanted something more bluetooth and freedom the v-710 really is verizons crippled bluetooth phone they have disabled all but 1 bluetooth feature you can not transfer images ringtones and more to your phone bluetooth feature can only be used for the hedset this really sucks also i was forced to purchase the extended battery because the 2screens at 65000 resoultion kills the available battery in under 15 hours the phone is heavy but that is normal for cdma it is also oversized to fit the screen and keys eventually you will get used to it there are pros and cons but overall i am happier now than i was with my sony ericcson t-610 running off t-mobile,197,47
2248,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,recently upgraded from the v265 and wish i had purchased this in the first place the 265 was a good phone but this phone has all the latest features including bt i resisted buying this phone due to the talk about limited bt functionality but realized it was just hype and i would not use anything more than the headset or car kit anyway beyond the features the quality of the phone take advantage of the great verizon network i have had a few carriers and verizon is the way to go not only is the quality much better but i actually pay less since most of my friends and contacts are on verizon and such a high percentage of my minutes are covered under in calling i take more advantage of this than i ever did rollover,138,48
2249,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,with a little more than two weeks my phone is dead with no apparent reason i only wanted to charge but then now it is completely dead i can not even power on the darn thing and with lousy verizon service you will be stuck like me please do not make the same mistake i made avoid this phone by any means especially if it is offered by verizon terrible terrible terrible there is no other way to describe how i feel i have never come across an electronic product that went dead after two weeks without any damage never in my life one other thing about verizon i went to one of the stores and this lady tried to give me a refurbished one but then guess what that phone did not turn on either i wasted good one hour and half and she said please bring the box with you and we will exchange with a new one today i found out that she thought i bought at one of retail verizon store so she can only give me a refurbished one what am i going to do with a refurbished one without any power on maybe they think i can just carry the dead cell phone to tell everyone how bad the phone is and how bad service I am getting anyway until i resolve my issue this is the most horrible experience i ever experienced with electronics i will never buy motorola and possibly avoid verizon but at this point i have no choice,253,49
2250,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is great and with great features the battery is long lasting the menu is just my other motorola so i di have no problem i think it is user friendly but you have to be able to spend some time with it i am very angry at verizon for blocking the bluetooh features this phone has great potential and we should be able to use them for me this phone is a great deal even by the price 7600 brand new i bought it direct from verizon the discount i got was due to my husbands corporate discount so in all i can not complain about the phone but i keep reccomending people not to hook up with verizon i am serving time with them for the next 2 years because i wanted this phone there is no free lunch,141,50
2251,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i had 2 phone for past 8 months here are some pros and cons cons i do not make that many call so my actual instrument usage is very limited insipte of that both of my phones have been replaced twice the buttons stops working the buttons are not very friendly you have to press really hard the phone stops to charge intermittently with it is original adaptors if there is even a little drizzle or hands are little bit wet the displays goes out camera is no where 1 mb pixel as claimed phone is really heavy bluetooth and memory card is locked pros reception is very good phone speaker is excellent battery life is okay,115,51
2252,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone 1 month ago i have used bluetooth service hands free jebra 250 bluetooth device these are my observations i have not used camera but it is nothing special pros 1 good battery life 2 excellent call quality i use verizon 3 excellent speaker phone 4 excellent lcd screen cons 1 bulky bulky my biggest complaint 2 contact entry if you want to enter 3 different phone for a single person that person will show up 3 times in ur contact list which is not good i think they made like this to provide voice recognizition system 3 voice recognizition system sucks needs lot of improvement even after training with my words so this purchase is a trade off between nice features and bulkiness at the of the day i bought cdma 9810 audio vox which is sucks no question about it i returned it and bought motorola 710 i used cdma 9800 audiovox earlier which was good i liked it cdma 9800 is better than 9810 which is higher version 9800 which is quite surprising they just added few feautres i can not cdma 9800 9810 of audivox with motrola 710 as 710 out weighs the other two in many aspects even although audiovox beats motorola in terms bulkiness i hope this helps u guys,224,52
2253,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i recently switched from to verizon and purchased this phone and i was a little disappointed with some of the features for example the memory slot is great but you can not transfer any mp3 on there from your home pc and use them as ring tones the phone comes with 2 mp3 ringtones but verizon will not let you download mp3s you can only download cdma purevoice so if we were planning on using mp3 ring tones with verizon do not waste your money on this phone motorola did not put all of thier best features on this phone i used to own a motorola i95 which you could list multiple phones numbers home work cellfor a single contact with this phone you have to make a new contact entry for each phone number even if it is for the same contact does anyone know why motorola is goind backwards the camera is ok and does not give you the picture quality a 12 megapixel should that being said the quality of service is very good I have had the phone for about a month now and only had 1 call where i was hearing echos i have not had any calls rejected because the network was busy unlike the 2 a week i had with nextel,213,53
2254,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i switched from t-mobile to verizon because i wanted to have good reception both at home and work in addition to being able to use my phone on the metro indeed i am happy with it which is the point of owning a cell phone-being able to make and receive calls when we want my husband actually has the same phone which he has had since last november after comparing these two identical phones we have noticed that the one i have takes better digital pictures and the battery lasts longer before i need to charge it overall i am happy with this phone it is great,107,54
2255,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i noticed everything fine with this piece except the battery life the battery life is around 120 to 130 minutes rather than what it is said the piece is good otherwise,31,55
2256,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i went through three or four motorola 270-cs waiting for a new cdma verizon bluetooth-enabled phone to come out i bought this one as far as phones go there has not much to complain about motorola makes a great phone the v710 has the best reception and sound quality I have found in a cell phone that being said I am sure the reason this high-end phone is now inexpensive is verizons miscalculation when they disabled most of the v710s bluetooth capabilities currently there has a lawsuit pending against verizon for this very reason i see verizon is now giving away a free bluetooth headset with the v710 to make you focus on what their bluetooth will do because it will not obex object transfer or much else and if you want a ringtone or music or anything on this phone you have to buy it now from verizon not me ever verizon we are always working for profit,152,56
2257,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this phone was rushed to production thus passing on the lack of quality to the consumer it is poor design starts from the continuation of an inadequately designed charging system that is extremely susceptible to debris wear and ultimately failure the main screen was permanently scratched within the first week because of the incorrectly sized keypad buttons every time the phone is open / closed it scratches the screen and then the exterior black top hinge the screen soon becomes an incredible hindrance to view the contents of the phone the blue tooth does not work with a power book what has point really yah you can use a cordless headset but after that there has not much use for it the camera is cocked at a funny angle supposedly moto will fix this but have they communicated that with any consumer nope advantages it does store your last 60 dialed and received calls the speaker phone is convenient but still lacking the user interface is well thought out but it should be it is from moto and they have been doing this since the beginning currently my phone has been sent in for repair because it does not charge at all even after multiple batteries and chargers the screen is scratched to oblivion do not believe the hype moto severely jumped the gun on this one do not buy this phone and let the buck be passed to you,230,57
2258,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have had my motorola v710 for approximately 5 months now and it does everything i want it to and more i listen to my mp3s on at all the time plus i can take pictures and store them on my trans flash card which i have seen raging in price from 1999 up to 3499 the pictures look great not a fan of the video feature although if you are technically challenged do not buy i would suggest this phone to people who can have a minute extra time to figure it out and does not need the whole thing spelt out for them great phone,106,58
2259,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,first the cons the camera is not what i was expecting i did not expect ansel adams quality but it is not what i get from my old 1 mp camera either but it is useful for taking snapshots the video is pretty useless as well the fact that verizon forces you to pay to send these crappy videos and photos makes sure that you will never use the camera see more below a bit spotty for mac osx users verizons software update further cripples phones usability greedy bastages pros great sound although you have to remember to keep the speaker over your ear truly great speakerphone I have had friends have nothat i was on a cell much less a speakerphone i think that between the speakerphone and the bluetooth headset moto actually almost meant for you not to use the handset in the conventional way mp3s as ringtones are fun but you have to work around verizon to do it copy them to the optional transflash card from your computer then to the phone seems to have great signal strength at least here in la i have very few drop-outs in areas that my old v8160 was really reaching for a signalscreen is gorgeous inside very nice outside bluetooth headsets are a godsend i can dial talk and hang up merely by touching my right ear general even with verizon trying to wrestle the last quarter out of your pocket it is a great phone if you get one with the earlier software you can get around verizon by using the translash card and a card reader to transfer images and mp3s to and from your computer I have heard that the later software removes some of that functionality which is why i am not flashing my phone,296,59
2260,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,i am extremely disappointed in this phone only because of verizon and how they have disabled the many features that this phone has to offer my boyfriend and i brought this phone roughly 30 days apart only to find that the software on his allowed him to download ringtones pictures and more utilizing a transfash well i went out and purchased a transflash as well but quickly found out that i could not transfer the files to the new software that is now installed on my phone bottom line is if you have the older software you can enjoy this v710 but if you have the newer software forget it i wish that as a consumer there is something that we can do about this misleading options on this phone i only wish i could return the phone i truly do not think that what verizon has done is legal if anyone has figured out a way to get around their many disabled features please let me know,165,60
2261,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i did some research before buying this phone and i found out that to use a lot of the phones features you will end up shelling out way too much money to verizon they disable the motorola-built features and replace them with customized features that they charge you for every time they are used the phone itself is an unbelievable piece of technology but has been crippled by verizon,70,61
2262,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone based on published features just to find out verizon disabled some of these i can not understand a company who has so much going for them coverage clarity would risk upsetting their customer base verizon could gain so much more by giving us access to the technology and making their services very affordable so more people would sign up for them instead of disabling features and choosing to nickel and diming us to death instead verizon are you listening shame on you you should fire the guy who made that decision i like your service but i hope you loose to motorola that was underhanded i want my bluetooth multimedia / data transfer back,115,62
2263,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,if you need the best reception possible the v710 is a great choice i bought this phone because my lg vx6000 also verizon could not hold a call for more than 30 seconds in my office i liked my lg and it worked great most everywhere else but i was hoping to get a phone that i could at least hold brief conversations with in my office without constant dropped calls well i have used the v710 for several hours now in my office without a single dropped call if it had better battery life i would easily give it 5 stars great phone,104,63
2264,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is incredibly user friendly picture of person calling appears next to their name if you store them next to phone no speaker phone is also a nice feature,30,64
2265,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i am writing this review because i noticed that lots of people here have given negative and bad reviews on this product i have been owning the v710 since february this year and so far i have not seen anything wrong with it i also use a bluetooth headset logitech and it is been a perfect gadget from what others say i guess there could have been few phones that had problems and was not recalled by motorola otherwise i have had no problems and before i bought i did a qucik survey of people owning this and they all gave me great feedback,102,65
2266,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,I have had this for about a month and find it to be incredibly frustrating annoying and difficult to use so much so that i was compelled to write this review the software is the main problem from not being able to select individual phonebook info from received / dialed calls to the default loud setting when plugged in this phone has me pining for my old non-camera lg it even alerts me that i have a missed call after I have checked voicemail for that missed call thanks that is if i can feel the feeble vibration when set to vibrate and after a month the phone feels like it is about to fall apart i should have taken the hint from the keyboard on the display model which was completely destroyed i bought this because of the tri-mode capabilities and it was the only one available at the time if I have missed something in the directions and any of this needs to be corrected i will gladly recind or edit this review until then I am stuck with my first and last motorola,180,66
2267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,I have owned this cell for about 9 months so far in that time I have exchanged it 4 times the first 3 had to be exchanged for software issues the 4th time something wacky happened when i used it with my ibook and i did not disconnect it properly i went back and verizon gave me a refurbished model like the other 3 times this cell will not do any file transfering by bt so that is a huge downfall it is almost useless since this was the only verizon bt cell i bought it but in the end i wish i did not the cell got a huge hype and it was all for nothing camera is useless as it takes sub-par pics I have seen samsungs do better than this the screen however is nice and crisp i also noticed that the cell scuffs really bad at the high points where it opens / closes but there is nothing you can do about that since you got to open and close it i think motorola missed the mark on this model overall it is a decent cell but do not expect it to do much for the money it is not worth it i wished i had waited oh well at least it is decent,208,67
2268,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,folks i have discovered a fly in the ointment so to speak if you click on all the names of the glowing reviewers here you will find that practically each and every one of them has only written one review that one review is on the v710 each bogus review has a nickname attached perhaps this person is a motorola employee trying to boost sales or a person who can not deal with the real life negative reviews of this product but be warned and alerted the not so glowing reviews are probably the ones you should take as legitimate now onward to the phone review i have owned about five or six cell phones over the past three years and the v710 is the worst i was drawn to the rebates and low price which basically got me in trouble from the get-go the phone has terrible battery life it is difficult to operate it is clunky and large the sound quality is poor there are hardly any ringtones on it and the button keys are flat and hard to press in short a piece of techno-junk,186,68
2269,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is awesome those of you that do not like this phone for one reason or another i would have to say that you do not have a clue what this phone can do this phone does it all with a 128 or a 256 mb trans flash card you can store tonz of photos even photo that you take with your normal digital camera and the the phones camera you can store them on there you can put mp3s on there and listen to them through the external speaker or get some headphones the best part is with the right software you can put full length movies on there and yes the quality is good granted it is not hd quality but it is a phone most people ask when am i ever going to watch a 2 hour movie on my phone and your right you probably will not but you can put all of the cool / funny little clips that are all over the internet on there and those make for a good laugh when your bored or something those who have this phone and do not like it all you have to do is search a little bit and you will love this phone this phone is the best phone I have ever had the voice reginition is awesome the speakerphone is awesome the whole phone is awesome,225,69
2270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,generally i do not do reviews but i thought this phone was getting an unjust bad reputation my last phone was an samsung n400 on sprint and it was bad battery died in a day and lots of dropped calls so my my criteria were good battery life great reception and speakerphone basically i wanted a good phone that would always be available to use it has excelled in all areas 0 dropped calls have yet to have 0 bars battery can go several days without a charge and the speaker phone is the best I have ever seen pros signal strength great sound quality superior speaker phone good battery nice lcds and over all good looks cons keypad leaves much to be desired but I am getting used to it camera is so-so at best bluetooth no intention of using it so i wish i could have saved some cash and got one without it,154,70
2271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,poor build quality battery life and there are no games included warning do not buyand battery life is even worse when you use the bluetooth i even bought the extended battery still very miner improvement if you want a quality phone buy the samsung a670,45,71
2272,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,does anyone know if you can buy this phone at the discounted price if you already have verizons service and you just want to upgrade your phone i can not seem to find this option when i try to buy this thanks,41,72
2273,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i do not normally do these types of things but you people are completely wrong you can have multiple numbers for one contact and only have the name listed once in the phone book for those of you who can not read the manual heres how hit contacts then hit the menu button scroll down to setup click that then hit view select primary contacts then hit done what do you know people with more than one number are only listed once this is what the little book that comes with the phone is for read it as a phone the v710 is amazing we all knew about the crippled bluetooth when we bought it thank verizon for that if you do not like it 175etf and you are free to do what you want you are not stuck with anything my battery will last 3 - 4 days with my normal useage if your battery is that bad take it back to the store and get a new one the camera takes decent pictures for a phone if you are using the picture on your phone change the resultion of the camera to 320x240 if you are going to put the photo on the computer use 1280x960 it will look good once you get it on the computer stop giving wrong information and read the phones manual remember it is a cell phone first and everything else second,233,73
2274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,1 not performing to specifications battery life is very bad and charging the phone takes time this phone does not really last more than 15 days poor design for battery swapping swapping battery is not an easy job the cover needs to be removed and often gets stuck i do not know why i had to remove the antenna to remove the cover i had to pry the battery to get it out replacing the battery is also an issue i need to line it up perfectly i found out the first time i installed the battery the cover snapped back ok and the phone worked but it would not charge so swapping batteries is not a solution for the battery life issue 2 not performing to specifications camera takes poor pictures based on specifications and comparing to other cell phones that are less epensive 3 poor user interface design for the phone book due to the display of multiple entries for cell home office fax and more with the same contact name,170,74
2275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is the best phone from verizon if you are stuck with verizon wireless this is the best deal use it as mp3 player in the gym ability to use mp3 ringtones is a great fun great voice dial very dependable as a phone excellent reception no dropped calls good sound exceptional speakerphone I had give it 48 instead of 5 because of crappy camera do not care much about that,69,75
2276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I am sad that people are not happy with this phone I have had excellent reception battery life is awesome it comes with cool rings and it is not so small that i lose it in my purse i think this is a great phone,41,76
2277,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,oh man this is the worst phone I have ever owned i had it for just a few days and immediately sent it back why well for starters the digital camera is the worst I have ever seen on any phone the pictures look like some piece of junk from the 70s secondly the phone is fat it is just way too big and bulky the antenna sticks out too far even when it is not pulled out finally the screen resolution is not very crisp and sometimes the phone lags yes i mean actually lags like a slow computer I have had another motorola phone that did this as well if you want a fancy phone and are shopping for service providers let me suggest the audiovox cdm-8940 from verizon i just got it and it is 10 times better no i do not work for verizon,139,77
2278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,bluetooth is awsome lots of cool features great reception and navigation through the menus is very easy the speaker phone is very good sounds good and loud some things that bug me are you can not change the outside screen to blink or light up when it rings camera they call it the 1st mega pixel in a phone I have had much better camera phones before but still it is ok there are no games unless you purchase them and most are monthly subscription games all in all the best phone I have ever had and the service verizon is great and I have tried them all and in this area eastern long island nothing comes close to verizons coverage,116,78
2279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i bought this phone the day it was released which coincided with my verizon contract expiration and free phone period after allowing myself to be seduced by the pre-release hype as about everybody knows by now the device is seriosly crippled by verizon as a telephone it is pretty good although there are undoubtedly others that perform as well and can be got for a quarter the price the absence of fully functional bluetooth however overrides the features that made it desirable in the first place and verizons attitude towards it is early adopters have me seriously considering another carrier the next time I am due to re-up,105,79
2280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,it might be because i have no intention of using bluetooth to transfer data i bought a transflash 128 mb card with sd adapter for 31 on ebay but i received this phone today and it has done very well calls are clear even from my basement which normally has very bad reception the camera is very good in bright light and how the pics turn out depends on how steady your hand is the video capture is also cool as long as you do not move the camera too quickly while shooting the screen is also worth pointing out it is very very clear and bright and huge too looks-wise the v710 is much cooler than almost all other cellies out there the razr might be cooler looking but the v710 has more features since I have only had the phone for one day i still have not figured out most of the features but maybe it is because i have not read the book-sized manual yet i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new celly especially since it is free i looked at it at best buy and it was 220 with a 40 month plan on amazon it is cheaper to begin with and then they threw in an extra 150 dollar rebate you can also choose the cheapest plan they offer and still qualify for the rebate i do not plan on using more than 300 daytime minutes per month so i went for the 30 dollar plan i hope I have made it clear that if you do not plan on using bluetooth for other things than wireless accessories this phone is perfect for you,275,80
2281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,just got it 2 days ago it took me a long to finalize this phone as everyone had mostly negative reviews here in amazon on cnet and more well the camera is not that bad it is as good as what you should expect from a cell then the voice quality is superb and it is so loud and clear you will love it the reception is great everywhere i guess this is the only bluetooth only voice choice from verizon and it has all other features of speaker phone and so on i guess it is a nice choice kaushal,95,81
2282,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i bought this for the bluetooth connectivity to my totota prius navigation system i connected well but when i wanted to move my phone book from the phone to the prius system it would not work i took it to the local verizon wirelees tech support guy and he said that verizon had disabled the ability of the phone to transfer the phone book the prius system and most nav systems only let you enter new phone s and more from the phone not the screen i returned the phone this is verizons problem not motorolas,95,82
2283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had the phone for 4 months now this phone has great reception my friend has a kyosera slider and i always get extra bar camera only works in daylight you need trans flash card tomidi / mp3 ringtones but the sound is great i did invest into the usb cable and motorola sync software now I am able to sych my outlook contacts with the phone calendar sync is the possibility as well but i do not use it the holster is cheap and cracked pretty soon had to go and get a bodyglove case which is quite good battery life is ok i get 2 - 3 days out of it with light use,115,83
2284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,this is supposed to be the only non-pda bluetooth phone by verizon i had to get this phone as i was limited to verizon service other carriers were not working well in my area pros saves last 60 calls dialed and received gr8 screen signal bluetooth cons bulky the antenna gets stuck everytime in my trouser pocket bluetooth probably works i have not tried yet but what sucks is verizons effort to make money everyway and not let bluetooth be used as the user wants the outside display gets blackened out and u have to press the button to see the time not too many ring tones games and more,107,84
2285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have only had this phone for a day most of the complaints i have heard from people are over exaggerated for example it is possible to only show a persons primary line although it is not the default for the phone it is possible to personalize the phonebook i also liked the custimization that can be done to this phone do not like pressing the upper right hand key to go to your phonebook you can change it so a different key will do it i have not really tried out the bluetooth and the camera is not all that great but for me there is not really any need for either of these features otherwise everything has been great,116,85
2286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i agree that the lack of full bluetooth support is rather lame beyond that although the phone is wonderful great reception great screen mp3 ringtones camera works just fine as long as there is enough light natural light works best it is a phone not a camera keep that in mind,47,86
2287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this phone has a mediocre user interface virtually featureless bluetooth and horrible phonebook / contact management first the user interface it is ok it is nice that it allows the ability to customize which options are displayed and in what order they appear on the home page of the phone unfortunately that along with the 12 megapixel camera are the only good things i have found with this phone second the bluetooth this phone does not allow copying items to / from the phone using a bluetooth compatible computer and does not allow emailing of photos so there is no way to get the photos to your computer and there is no way to perform contact / address book sync with a computer or handheld device pda also no calendar sync third there is no way to have a single phonebook entry person containing multiple phone numbers each phone number occupies a line in the phone book so needless to say the phonebook list is way longer than it needs to be very few people that i contact frequently have only 1 phone number i think my grandma is the only person i know that has only 1 phone number it is not a bad phone otherwise maybe I have just come to expect more from a cell phone for example my less expensive sony ericsson t610 had full bluetooth addressbook / calendar sync a more neatly organized phonebook although took slightly lower quality pictures but it remiscent aside from the nicer screen / graphics and camera of an old circa 1999 nokia i had although waaaaayy more expensive,255,87
2288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,this phone is great i love it but verizon crippled it they disabled object transfer over bluetooth so you will not be able to get pictures off your phone put mp3s onto your phone or download your contact list withouth buying a transflash card and reader this is something verizon did because profit is their middle name they want you to pay 25 / picture to send them to yourself they want you to buy their ringtones through get it now other than this problem the phone is great pictures are a bit grainy and dark but they are as good as can be expected from a phone the form factor is a bit bigger than expected but the screen is absolutely huge for more info about this phone there is a user community at [ ] it is under the verizon heading,141,88
2289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,have had this phone for a couple of weeks traded up from a t720i a great improvement much more usable the screen resolution is just awesome menus and get it now features are much faster i have been using a sandisk 128 mb transflash and usb reader to transfer images and ringtones / mp3s with no problems you can fit a ton of pictures / mp3s on that card you do have to copy any audio files from the card over to the phone memory to use as a ringotne there is a ton of free audio editing software out there to create and edit your own ringtones this is a good way to get around verizons pay-for-pictures / ringtones junk buttons have a nice solid feel speaker phone is loud and voice dialing works very well i had some trouble with the unit turning off unexpectedly but has not happened since i fully charged the battery i have not used bluetooth yet and do not plan to camera is decent for a phone video is pretty choppy all of the applications i have downloaded look great on the display,182,89
2290,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,do not buy this phone this phone is great in terms of rf and use but that is about it everything you would expect from motorola such as camera and bluetooth have been crippled severly you can even use bt to transfer pics or mp3s you have to flash the phone for it to work which is a pain verizon has crippled this phone by disabling other features like multimedia function from their program mobile phone tools so the only way is to use their expensive get it now program stay away do not get this phone til they fix it in the future,102,90
2291,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,i purchased the phone because of the bluetooth technology this technology has been mostly disabled by verizon do not buy if you plan to use this phone with bluetooth very disappointed will sell shares of motorola and verizon as only recourse burned once never again,45,91
2292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this is the buggiest phone i have ever used it has all sorts of problems with bluetooth integration to the acura handsfee link system also verizon has crippled the phone so that you can not transfer files using bluetooth to force you to use their get it now service which is much much slower in addition to the fact that you have to pay for it finally the camera is aweful I have seen better pictures from cheap 640x480 cameras and do not even try to take a picture indoors i am very disappointed that this is the best verizon can come out with in a bluetooth handset why pay hundreds of dollars for this when you can get a better bluetooth phone for use on the cingular network for 50,128,92
2293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,but verizon only had this for the bluetooth i got it when it came out and i was extremely pissed off for a month i could take the lousiest pictures that i have ever seen it was like you pause your vcr on a horribly recorded tape i had another phone before this with at t for over a year and that was not a megapixel but 640x400 well it was less resolution but each picture came out 1000 times better in light and otherwise even outside the fotos come out very bad put it this way i never use the camera anymore even when i say i wish a had a camera to take a funny foto of someone it is a bluetooth enabled phone which works so so with the 820 motorola headset i do not think you should buy this if you need a camera phone only if you need a bluetooth phone with verizon if there are none others around very dissapointed with the motorolla phone it was my first and ia had heard many good things about it which this phone made me forget them and just think of the horrible quality of this phone oh and i heard that there is or was a recall on the first wave of these phones on the camera lens i returned it and i got another replaced for free at least i made motorolla pay for it is crappy phone they put out there and it is quite big for phones out there which are getting smaller every day the v600 is much better and a bit smaller if they had it for verizon i would have gotten it in a heartbeat,280,93
2294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this v710 phone has had terrible reviews because of it is many bad features and numerous problems verizon will be releasing motorolas new evdo e815 phone to replace this phone very soon i urge people not to buy this v710 phone anymore and wait for the new replacement the e815 looks very similar but has an improved keypad better bluetooth capability better quality camera and a new version of the speech recognition software the e815 has been previewed at this months ces electronics expo in las vegas with great reviews here is something you can read [ ] verizon is expected to release the e815 by may 2005,106,94
2295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i was a bit iffy at first after reading all of the reviews here but being that this was the only bluetooth phone verizon offered i gave it a try it is an awesome phone speakerphone works great the volume can go painstakingly high as well as low voice dialing is awesome because it recognizes your command without any programming and if you have an accent or whatever can adjust and adapt can also dial by speaking digits aloud i admit the camera by itself does a rather poor job for the 12 megapixel rating so minus a star for that the video shooting mode is pretty cool records sound too for the individual above who could not see more than three names in the contacts list he must have not read the manual as you can put it into list mode and see much more the display is excellent and razor sharp the sound clarity is great and paired with the motorola hs810 bluetooth headset is a killer combo with voice dial you have no need to ever touch the phone which is always in my bag a great phone if you want a digital camera go buy one if you want a good phone here it is as a side note i did not purchase the phone from amazon i bought through verizon as part of an upgrade but bought for same price,234,95
2296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,the v710 alone provides better speaker phone quality especially to the other end than in conjunction with the hf600 get a simpler charging adapter for the car and something to attach the phone to the dash transflash memory add-on works ok motorola mobile phone tools 30 is problematic it would be nice to know about alternatives to sync outlook how another reviewer moved stuff via the flash memory option it works better as a speaker phone than as a non-speaker phone it seems to be a little quiet when held to the ear compared to other phones but there must be something that can really pump up the volume since the speaker phone is so good the obvious stuff is good if you look at the phone in the store yourself display quality call quality analog backup to digital service have not done much with the camera but I am starting to think that with the way most people treat their phones how is the lens supposed to stay clean and not blur or otherwise hinder images it may really only be good to have for impromptu photos think about are separate pda and phone better even if it means 2 devices instead of 1 the pda vendors have more of a track record with hooking up to the pc are separate camera and phone better for most pictures the camera vendors that made film in addition to digital cameras have a history and prices are plumetting and megapixels and features rising,253,96
2297,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,hey i can not help my opinion i own this phone and it is not as great as these overly exicted people say it is a good phone to start off with but truthfully there are better phones like the motorola v330 that is a better phone altogether this phones speaker phone does suck it is ringer volume is mediocre sprint and nextel have a louder choice of phones it is very small the same exact size of the v180 and there has nothing but an ugly poorly made leather pouch to put the little thing in it is a beautiful phone to look at but once you put it in the pouch i bought from the t-mobile store it is no longer good looking the menu is a bit confusing at first but the battery life is good picture quality is good reception is good no dropped calls but i must say that sometimes it is hard to hear someone on the other line not that they are breaking up it is just too low sometimes the vibration option is weak and the graphics and ringers that come with the phone are also weak the games are ok anyway you decide have fun,191,0
2298,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,i returned it experienced high pitched noise at all times faint but there speakerphone volume is so low as to making it usless in all but silent environments ringer volume is also underpowered battery life is ok not great ok menu layout was confusing,42,1
2299,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,5.0,positive,i was upgrading from virgin mobile when i purchased this phone best decision I have made in awhile the service and recepetion is wonderful with t-mobile and this phone one reviewer said they wished there were icons to designate home / cell / work / faxbut there are when you add a contact you can choose what type of number it is and in your phonebook a little icon appears next to the number the text messager is nice you can easily send a single message to a bunch of people at once i found that the volume level could be set very high contrary to the other reviewer a few entries before me i could hear it in my car with the music loud the vibrator was also stronger than they made it out to be there are many ringtones to choose from from simple rings and sounds to more intricate songs from t-mobile you can also purchase a hifi or megatone ringtone which are very clear and a bit more fun it is small and lightweight as well fits in my purse nicely the backgrounds included with the phone are not bad at all i happen to like a few but once again you can download others online i also set voice recognition to a few of my best friends and special ringers for them as well it does have a bunch of nice features and for the price i highly recommend it to accompany your t-mobile service,243,2
2300,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,5.0,positive,my first criteria for the phone is small between other phones available for t-mobile and verizons this is one of the lightest and smallest i have no need for fancy features for example camera so this is a nice choice i got this phone only a week ago i have not found anything i do not like about it or the service other pros long talk time talked for 55h and it was down by 1 bar the battery did not get hot either speaker phone is pretty clear,87,3
2301,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,5.0,positive,okay i was a nokia fan for 5 years decided to give motorola chance when they came up with a nice looking small flip phone that does everything you need and without a camera the speakerphone feature is very convenient and it weights nothing i have not experienced call drops yet this device is really excellent,56,4
2302,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,i was happy with my previous phone v300 this one gives lot of dropped calls lot of static when travelling in car recommend buying some other phone,27,5
2303,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,i upgraded to motorola v188 from sony ericsson with t-mobile as my service provider the phone looks amazing with it is nice gui and other graphical features it is sleek and nice to have but during my two years of service with t-mobile i never had any issues with dropped calls as with this phone on an average i get see two-to-three calls being dropped the conversation gets disconnected people can not hear to what i am saying i am finding ways to not to use this phone anymore i am not so happy with this moto phone v188,96,6
2304,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,to be honest this is my first cell but when i finaly decided to purchase one this is exactly what i was looking for simple i did not want a camera i did not want a pc or mac if you prefere i did not want an mp3 player i wanted a phone and this is exactly what it is nice crisp grahpics uses the hifi ringtones has voicemail and text messaging it also has enough features like aim a web browser a calander and get more options dependant on sp to be multi-tasked but it still knows it is purpose a simple phone for a simple user,104,7
2305,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,bought it from a t-mobile store new when i renewed my contract i loved the display crisp graphics but that is about it that is good on this phone I am comming from a nokia 3595the motos reception is bad it breaks up and it cut a conversation 3 days after i bought it less than 50 mins used oing back as soon as possible back to nokia too bad thier display sux,68,8
2306,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,i want to echo comments below i am also a 2-time loser with this series of phones the v-180 and v-188 the exterior lcd on the v-180 cracked at some point while it was in my pocket for what reason i have no clue t-mobile said that this is a known problem with these phones and offered a warranty repair in two weeks with no temporary replacement no thanks two weeks without your only phone is a long time so i payed 50 and got a new v-188 motorola had clearly improved this phone with a beefier plastic housing around the exterior lcd after 4 months that cracked while in my pocket but the lcd was in tact so i guess the upgrade worked later on i dropped the phone once and now i have intermittent reception it will work fine for a while and then not for a while yeah i dropped it and all but i had two cheap nokia bar phones before this that i could fling across a parking lot without any damage other than that i do love the flip phone concept it is light and smaller than most other phones and the interface is intutive if you want a cool cheap little phone short on superflous featurees i recommend it just make sure to treat it like fine china i would like to go back to nokia but surprise given all the phones they make the selection amongst the carriers in my area is pretty unimpressive,248,9
2307,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,this was a decent phone for about 6 months but i started noticing that the volume diminishing over time in the last few weeks after 1 year and just after the t-mobile warranty ran out the phone has developed a lot of static and people say they have trouble hearing me my wifes phone the same model is still working reasonably well after one year but she uses it very infrequently from the other reviews I have seen i think you can expect about 4 - 9 months of decent function out of this phone but it does not seem to withstand normal wear and tear,102,10
2308,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,I have had the v180 and the v188 motorolas atempt at an upgrade firstly I have had the outer plastic screen ontop of the caller identification crack within 4 months of getting both phones and this was from completely normal use secondly the speaker phone function is completely useless unless you are in a dead silent area otherwise it is not loud enough the phone also get terrible reception the first time i had this phone i was with cingular second time i was with t-mobile i got sub-par reception with both phones / companies when people with the same carrier would consistently get better reception no matter where we were I have had the microphone begin to fail ridiculous numbers of dropped calls sometimes going 10 calls in a row all of them dropped within 15 seconds or just failing the call altogether this being in an area i normally get 3 - 4 bars while I am not holding the phone this phone is the biggest piece of junk i have ever owned and so is the v180 the only difference between the two is aesthetic the front faceplate on the v188 is not as easily removed stay away from this phone even if you get it free with a plan it is still not worth it go with any other phone or pay a few bucks for a better one you will regret it within a few months when you get this piece,234,11
2309,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,I am in the pro-v188 camp i think it is a solid good-quality cell phone thescreen is a bit small compared to more expensive phones but hey you get this for free before the generous rebate so stop bitching about this not being a high-end phone for it is not meant to be a high-end phone it has good reception and voice quality and is built rather like a tank solid durable a little on the thick side if you want something stylish go with a razr or pebl or slvr if you want something small and lasts forever go with a sanyo pcs phone for sprint but the v188 is a good basic phone no doubt about that,118,12
2310,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,i have not been happy this phone is horrible they replaced part of it and it still does not work right i tried customer service over and over the only way to get help is to refuse to pay bill until they respond to the problem not happy all the way around,50,13
2311,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,motorola went out of their way to make the volume buttons on the outside of the phone exposed even when closed make a loud stupid beeping noise these buttons are not recessed so about three times a day this phone makes this stupid beeping noise from my pocket with everyi take until i pull it out and carry it in my hand and no I am not fat and wearing tight pants no there has no way to turn it off that t-mobile or i can find except to turn off the ringer which kinda defeats the purpose of carrying the phone in my pocket anyway i guess the point motorola is trying to make is that this phone should always be carried in your hand and looked at who knows if motorola knows how to turn off this beeping since they do not offer customer support on this phone i have to carry this phone for work but at least I have saved two friends from making this motorola mistake by showing them how obnoxious this phone is to carry around,180,14
2312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,i like this phone it gives good features and other things all my friends have that phone it is mad hot,20,15
2313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,this is my first moto phone and I am not happy with it at all before this phone i had a samsung when it was time to get a new phone i went for the v188 because it is small and inexpensive i was very happy with the phone at first easy to use you can probably get away with not having to look at the manual and the sound quality was pretty good after only six months of having the phone I am having problems like dropped calls call failure and lots of static needless to say i can not wait to to get my new samsung that will be arriving in a couple of days,112,16
2314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,i have been using v188 for 7 months it is nice and small to fit in my back pocket the speaker phone is nice however it seems to hang up the call middle of the conversation also it is a bit slippery it is also hard to open so consider using both hands while driving although is not safe to use any cell phone using your earphone is a must unless you want to get your hands off the wheel to answer the call using the voice dialing is a hassel since you have to use the nav botton to get to it it is easier to dial it a down grade from v60-v66 with side botton for faster voice dialing i got the phone because i wanted motorolla and a small phone i am ready for a chage may be t809,142,17
2315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,i picked up a motorola v188 because i wanted a simple small inexpensive cell phone with no special featuers and this phone fit the bill i had to go back to the t-mobile store within a couple of months because all my friends complained that they could barely hear me the store gave me a new one for free and this one worked great for about five months now whenever i have to use it the call always has a lot of static i need to tap it a couple of times to get rid of the noise this time I shall pay to not get stuck with this phone again I have had motorola phones before and they have worked great so i may end up with another motorola but definitely not the v188,132,18
2316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,the first v188 that i got came with a defective speakerophone i returned it and the second one that i got was has some software issue and the phone scree becomes black and shuts off every time i open the phone to make a phone call the battery also drains really fast basically it is a simple phone to make and receive calls but the phone is too flaky and no less than a toy phone,76,19
2317,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,whatever you do do not buy this phone looking back buying this phone on ebay was the worst purchase i have ever made and i honestly mean that forget any other featurses as a phone the v188 fails although calls come in fairly clearly on my end those who i am talking to constantly complain about how bad i sound are asking me to repeat myself and more literally every other sentence the caller asks me to repeat myself and this is from my bedroom where i have good service on all other t-mobile phones I have used I have been a t-mobile customer for almost 3 years and my family has 4 lines with t-mobile none of our phones have ever performed this poorly this whole experience has been extremely frustrating in fact i have already switched to a different phone the nokia 6101 i strongly recommend that you go for the 6101 instead even if you do not need a camera the 6101 is the way to go it is the exact opposite of the v188 calls come through clearly on both ends and the reception is excellent with the nokia 6101 I have even been able to make and receive calls from my basement something i have not been able to do on any other phone I have owned,213,20
2318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,i have had this phone for over four months now i have not had any of the problems listed by other users except for the size of numbers-they are a bit small i have gotten excellent reception with this phone even inside most stores and when using over bridges both places where i have had no reception with other phones including other motorola models sound has always been crystal clear no echo and rarely breaks up i really enjoy this phone and agree that it is excellent for a low-end model sturdier and higher quality than samsung in my opinion,99,21
2319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,i had been very happy with my motorola phone until the battery started losing it is charge within a day even when the phone was turned off the friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem after the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable due to customer abuse i have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage unless using it to make phone calls counts as customer abuse but got the same comment without explanation after i had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation it seems that motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty you will be fine with a motorola phone as long as it works after that you are on your own,162,22
2320,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,the numbers on the pad and the coresponding letters r minute you are going to need a magnafying glass to dial not recommended at all stay away,27,23
2321,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,5.0,positive,this is exactly the phone i was looking for 1 got an excellent speaker 2 and no camera who needs a camera on a cellphone anyway very satisfied with this simple and compact phone,34,24
2322,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,i rarely write reviews but feel i need to warn people about this phone i purchased it because of the handy features such as speaker phone and quad band coverage however i immediately noticed when talking on the phone that the sound is choppy or echoes it happens almost every time i talk at first i thought it might be the reception where i live but my wifes samsung phone rarely has choppy sound i have spoken to the techs at t-mobile and after running tests to find out what the problem is they sent a new phone plus 999 shipping the new phone had the same problems my recommendation is not to be pulled-in by the nice features this phone has and to choose a different model with much better sound and reception,134,25
2323,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,while the list of things this phone does not have is long what it does have is far more important it has functionality it does what it says it will do with little or no deviation if with motorolas quirks this is a quadband world phone with speaker the best thing about this phone over older motorolas is that saving phone numbers default to the sim versus the phone memory making it much easier to keep all your phone numbers the next time you switch devices,85,26
2324,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,a nice looking phone for a cheapie fairly easy to use with some odd quirks I am used to nokias and samsungs with basic features that are enough for those who mostly want to make phone calls the organizer works well and it is nice to be able to send text messages to multiple numbers but the phone does have the annoying motorola trait of only having one number per name entry however the v188 failed at even being a basic phone for me as reception was notably worse than my samsung x105 which I have just gone back to after a few months of using the v188 and it got especially horrible when friends who also had t-mobile picked up motorola v330s the printed manual was also poor seeming like the writers just made sure they wrote about all the features as opposed to explaining them in-depth,145,27
2325,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,this is a simple practical phone it is light and smalli have dropped this phone a couple times and still works there has just one thing about it i do not like the sound quality very much i purchased a hi-fi ringtone high voltage by ac / dc and and it sounds way to flat from when i listen to it on my ipod but overall the plans are great i got t-mobile with this phone which is better than cingular and i get free aim on it when i am far away from the computer even although sometimes i do not get full range in open areas which is strangeand when you are on speakerphone it interferes with other radio signalsi really enjoy this phone and encourage you to buy it,126,28
2326,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,this is only the 2nd cell phone i have ever purchased it is small and easy to handle however i find that the instruction manuel is very difficult to understand i have the volume turn up as high as it will go and it is still difficult to hear the person calling me thank you ray,56,29
2327,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,5.0,positive,i got one of these for my mom and one for myself as a former cs rep for a major wireless carrier i consider myself to be well educated in cell phones pros flip phone light small responsive cpu keys are spaced well and responsive for fat / shaky fingers excellent speakerphone that works while the she shall is closed very long battery life ring tone can be switched from loud to vibrate to silent by using volume keys in standby standard moto feature cons not flashy no mp3 or impressive audio features to gloat about like i said very practical non-standard moto charger you will need a new car charger if you have the 3 pin funky moto connector they have used for years,122,30
2328,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,as a long time nokia user i was sceptical about switching to a motorola phone but since nobody wants to offer the nokia flip phones i decided on the v188 first of all t-mobile was offering it for free so what did i have to lose i like the small size the blue lighting on the keys and i was surprised at how good the sound quality has been the basic functions are easy enough to figure out on the menu but sometimes i still have to hunt around to change something overall i would recommend this phone and i would recommend t-mobile it does not offer the camera or video of other phones but i think it is a great basic phone,122,31
2329,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,1.0,negative,i do not know how they can screw up something as simple as this phone but it ismply does not work the problems which i experienced with it are 1 turns off by itself 2 freezes up 3 does not turn on otherwise the design and the simple features provided are great but it simply does not work so do not but this thing unless you have the free time to ship it back and get something that actually works,80,32
2330,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,2.0,negative,this phone comes with all the standard features spearkerphone voicemail external caller identification it looks great but unfortunately this is where the quality of the phone stops it literally takes forever for the phone to turn on and off you have to hold the on button for 5 to 6 seconds to get it to turn on or off this is unacceptable for a flip phone where the on button is hidden and you can not accidently press it i realize this sounds impatient but if you do not hold the button long enough the phone will not turn on and you have to start all over again it is also slow to switch from menu to menu kind of like when you have a slow computer and you press a key and there is a delay until the computer responds the phone also takes forever to reconnect service when i come out from a tunnel or subway the wait is sometimes 30 seconds to a minute again this might sound impatient but it feels like an eternity when the phone is just sitting there at the main menu and does not appear to be making a connection attempt there are also multiple welcome screens again this is unacceptable i know it is a motorola phone i do not need to be constantly reminded overall i give this phone 2 stars due to the excessive wait time i keep coming back to it because of the look and the apparent value but if you are planning to buy this phone find a friend who already has one and check it out first if the wait time is unacceptable move on to another phone,278,33
2331,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,4.0,positive,so i bought a cellphone to use as a cellphone not a black berry not a camera not an entertainment unit I had buy a psp if i wanted that or because i wanted a cool accessory i just needed a working phone for a cheap price i have not been dissapointed thus far you do have the option of setting the phone to vibrate then ring and i have found that this allows me to hear most incoming calls this phone rides around in the bottom of my backpack all day and is doing fine which is why i say most incoming calls i do not think it is the ringer volume per say but rather the location it is small and light gets good reception i did not find the menu layout confusing as some people did it has a calendar function which i found useful and the battery lasts for 2 to 3 days i do spend a lot of time on the phone and charges up again within an hour or 2 the games it comes with are not that great they are not supposed to be they are just there to whet your appetite so you buy the full versions from t-mobile also some people lament the lack of an outside call answer button they have to flip it open i think that is great because that way I am not accidently answering phone calls i like the outside display so summary good battery life and recharge no problems with reception light small can ride around in a backpack,257,34
2332,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0009F1ST8,3.0,neutral,this phone is small and has the advantage of being able to operate just about anywhere because of it is quad-band capability which not a lot of phones have the complaint about a pouch case below is not valid you can buy a wide variety of after-market cases cheap ring volume is fine speaker volume is fine there are functions that I shall never use on this phone and the small buttons can because you to enter those functions aol messengerby mistake my previous phone a v60 had a convenient external button for voice activated dialing and was built sturdier this one looks like if i drop it it is done for and voice activated dialing requires you to hit two keys in succession which is a bother the manual this phone comes with might as well be written in urdu it is that opaque but you can find out how to use this thing by checking online forums overall a decent but unintuitvely designed phone that gets the job done for the price it is probably a good value if i had to do it over again I had probably spend 50 more bucks and get something designed better but it is hard to find a quad-band phone that does not have even more unnecessary features than this one ps one year update one of the buttons stopped working i used some computer spray to clean out the dust still did not work i opened up the back to get at the keyboard there are no screws to open up the phone just permanent rivets it is not repairable or cleanable i went to the phone service provider to see what he could do he said i needed to get a new phone so much for quality goods,292,35
2333,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,my v3i shipped with a 256 mb card and itunes allowed a maximum of 50 songs bought a 512 mb card and still only 50 songs hope someone can hack this soon since card can fit far more otherwise i am very satisfied with the phones other features update itunes not compatible with bluetooth either once bluetooth module is connected itunes continues playing but not audible through headset,66,0
2334,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i have had the original razor since it came out on valentines day my sister bought a pink v3i i have played with both phones i had to teach her how to use hers this is my opinion they are exactly the same except for 2 things 1-the v3i has a video camera and the v3 does not 2-the battery on the v3i has been updated and seems to hold a charge alot longer than the v3 other than that they are the same,82,1
2335,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,well I am in the military and was on a mission in the phillippinesi heard the hype on cnet 2006 and went out to get a v3i phoneas u will find out from readings it says that the countries that have itunes in it are phillipines includedwell let me say that is horse crapmine does not come with itunes and it says it clearly on the side of the box at the bottom side v3i generic non-itunes hgm meaning there is not a itunes in it but the other mp3 player software instead you can also read elsewhere on the net about the ones that have itunes the message button is replaced with a itunes icon insteadso that verified my v3ijust be careful before u buy anywhere and ask to see the side of the box where it describes what kinda phone model it is I am trying to go back to the store before i leave this country and see if they can exchange it for the real deal itunes further report later,163,2
2336,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,as of 2/6/2006 most mac users are able to sync via usb or bluetooth but not through both it seems to depend on where the product was intended for euro or asia but it seems to be able to sync through one or the other as for the address book problem s motorola has also updated the software along the way but unlike computer oses it is not always readily apparent I am not exactly sure if the reviewer with the multiple address problem has tried this just change the sort by option in the address book setup to name then add numbers to the names instead of making new entries that sounds like it should resolve it there is one other caveat if you want the itunes software in the phone the us version right now does not come with it and neither does the euro version but apparently the asian / middle east version do huh yea who knows what has going on still a great phone just too much work for everything,176,3
2337,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,giovanni everything you said about this phone is true the setting up of the contacts is the most idiotic set up i have ever seen there is a way to search for contact with out having to go through all of them individually but it is so complicated and the manual is of no help and i already forgot how i managed to set it up the phones menus differ greatly from the manuals description of what they are needless to say i was happier with my old nextel that was 3 years old too,96,4
2338,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,and i can sync my phone just fine over usb anyway isync recognizes the phone and syncs it perfectly i love this phone with a very few exceptions 1 it did not have aim installed by default i still do not have it because you need to use a pc proram to modify the phone to enable aim and i use a mac 2 there are no bt profiles on the unit i purchased 3 since the phone has not been released in the us yet motorola will not give us owners support on the phone other than that I am happy with it I had suggest that you buy one from a place where you can try out the phone first to make sure nothing you want is missing before you get it,128,5
2339,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,great little phone very useful for people who are not interested in to much internet it does work wonderfully with texts gave it to my little daughter as a school day present she wished to get something simple and she got a good talk phone for a cheap price,49,6

2344,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,everything from the box to the phone looked used screen protectors on all the parts that covered the phone were scratched to he shall it was not even in the molded plastic in the box or really fit in to it so it did not hold it secure during shipping i have an old razr that felt less used and sloppy when you flipped it open totally bummed out i really wanted this phone,71,11
2345,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,in the past motorola used to make these phones and they were very well-made too no sharp corners or edges well-fitting battery covers and more then just recently maybe within the last few years or so there have been a lot of china-made copies they were cheaper but they are not the same quality anymore all the phones i tried to buy all came with sharp corners and edges had badly-aligned battery covers and more I have more or less given up trying to find a genuine razr v3i,86,12
2346,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,this is not a original motorola razr quality phone i have had 4 of them and this one di not seem to be the same quality the voice quality was bad the hinge started to come apart less that a week after i got it i returned the phone to amazonfor a refund,53,13

2351,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,this product did not work well after 2 weeks it stopped reading my sim card on a regular basis thus i had to by a new phone when out of the country thus i wasted 80,36,18
2352,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,can not send pictures unless you change internet access settings need to seem edit to access automatic date and time update these steps are well beyond the average user i spent a lot of time to resolve these two issues not for the faint of heart,46,19
2353,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,actually there are two problems the first one is related to the battery a not original motorola came with the phone that did not work at all which is not an issue for me because i have three br50 batteries from my old v3 phones so it is just a matter of replacement but the second problem is unsolvable that i found out on tuesday that the phone is defective and not charging at all i tried with three batteries so i had to use one of my old phones to charge a battery and switch it to this v3i it has become a hassle i bought the v3i because i travel a lot to different countries and this old four band gsm is very useful as a back up phone with prepaid sim from each country i am travelling abroad and will be back in six months so unable to return the phone by mail and cancel the purchase,162,20
2354,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,this phone is very cheaply made and it definitely shows horrible quality i can not think of one positive thing to say about it i returned it shortly after i bought it because it definitely was not worth the money i paid for it a reasonable price for this piece of garbage is maybe 5 tops,55,21
2355,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i had to buy another phone to replace this one the voice always jumbled together and a lot of time i did not understand what the person on the other end said and vice versa two people did ask me whether we talked on the same subject i think i wasted my money on this phone,56,22
2356,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,i had bought the product for my husband for his birthday i bought it in december when i got it on sale i kept it in the box and stored it away which that would have had nothing to do with it not working it is half my fault for not testing it but i did not think i would have to but thedoes not even hold a charge when you plug it in it will not charge at all my husband was very happy about his present because he is the type who loves the old school phones but now they will not do a exchange or anything so now i am totally at a loss if you buy from this supplier make sure theworks,126,23
2357,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,had some manufacturing defects sound quality poor battery takes long to charge and does not hold a charge long not pleased,20,24
2358,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i received the phone with it is charger as it should be the thing is hat it was not a motorola one but a different one without a brand in addition to this i thing that something is wrong with the battery as i need to charge it twice a day even without using the phone i still have a razr from 2008 that still works perfectly which makes me wonder what is wrong with this one,76,25
2359,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,i just can not understand why a very fine firm like motorola would put a piece of trash like this on the market the back cover will not lock the instructions are a skimpy joke hard to place battery worse for the phone card flimsy rough and disturbing to the touch bahh hope they give me my money back never but a motorola again,63,26
2360,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,very low quality product i bought same model few years ago and was much better quality this one is very poorly made the battery cover will not stay in place i also got the wrong,35,27
2361,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i have several of these phones already this one is to replace one that is more than 6 years old these phones are great for what i need and having a quad-band unlocked phone is imperative for overseas travel for less than 6500 incl s h is a steal,48,28
2362,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i always wanted to have this model phone when i saw it on amazon i got all excited and decided to purchase it i knew that motorola razr v3i was more expensive than the price that i paid for it that made me skeptical about the phones quality and if it was genuine after incredibly fast delivery i was able to use it and realized how happy i was with this purchase i was so happy that i purchased another one for my mother this is a great buy if you want a simple reliable beautiful phone my second review on this product I have purchased this phone last year and after a couple of month of using it i realized that it was not all that actually this phone was not very durable even although it has an outer she shall made of aluminum this phone and other one i bought two just stopped working after 2 - 3 months no falls or submerging in water just stopped maybe these two were lemons but i do not think so this phone does not have warranty so it is up to you to take the risk i do not recommend this product for me it was just waste of money,204,29
2363,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,it is good for what i paid always wanted this sleek phone it is worth the money i spent i recommend this product,21,30
2364,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i am not very satisfied from this purchase it did not have the features that were indicated in the description fred,21,31
2365,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,motorola razr v3i worked good when new music that was installed did not play continously to play music i had to play one by one manually charge to battery did not last very long and had to be charged daily as battery life was short ring tones were loud and audible the one i purchased worked for a good year wished it could last longer,65,32
2366,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i bought this phone for my wife i had owned one when they first came out i am disappointed that this phone does not work the same as the one i had also it looks cheap like it may be a knock off my wife does not like it because it does not have the itune player like my old one did and reception is lousy,64,33
2367,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i love razrs i owed a v3 t which was amazing i can not find one like it i thought that by buying this v3i with expandable memory I had be able to store m 80 txts but apparently the text mssg are saved on the sim card not the memory card also this unlocked version will not allow you to receive or send picture messages stay away from this phone,68,34
2368,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,i wish i never would have bought thise phoneit only holds charge 1 day it freezes up sometimes for 30 sec even when u have an incoming call so u can not answer it,32,35
2369,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,very good value for the money phone is very nice looking a little elegant and conservative i would say the metal top gives it a little better look and feeling compared to the previous plain razor v3 i use it heavily for work and even so the battery charge is good for 2 or 3 days speakers sound nice for mp3 playing the camera takes clear pictures and it is full of other little extras however if you are a fan of advanced features and apps then think twice for me and for work this phone is perfect the only thing that i do not like much is that the volume is not so loud and if you are talking in a noisy place you may want it a little higher and also be advised that this offer does not include the little memory card so you have to buy it separately delivery was very fast and so far i can say i am happy with this phone if you want a day to day good looking phone i recommend you to get it,182,36
2370,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,maybe there has a work around if you mess with the programming of the phone what a drag why would they do this i regret this purchase i may yet return it,31,37
2371,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,the razr it is a very good phone i have had some minor problems with assigning ring tone from my memory chip but for the price of the phone it works good and it has a very good reception it is a pretty good little phone i had and initial battery issue but they sent me a new one and it is very good on battery use,67,38
2372,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,razr v3i is a good phone with easy to use features the included pair of headphones work great with music and micro-sd slot gives additional storage i am using a 2 gb micro-sd card and it works great however there are issues with the battery charging when tried to charge directly with included charger the battery never reached fully charged status even after 24 hrs of continuous charging i have replaced the battery but the problem remains the same i took out the battery from phone and tried charging with a desktop charger and this time it worked now i am using two batteries one in phone and one on desktop charging cradle big pain but this is only way to make use of money i have spent on this phone,132,39
2373,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i can not say i had problems with this phone being a former owner of the older version v3 while both looked the same the v3i have a lot of added features that for a while confused me but after a week of tweaking i finally came to love the added features and was happy with it while it is true that this phone is not mac-friendly i also found out that the phone tools software do not recognize it as an existing product of motorola extra features aside i got this phone because of the memory expandability that the v3 lacked I am one phone user who does not use whatever extras are stashed in to make a phone worthy of ones time so long as i could make / receive calls send / receive text messages and listen to a bit of music internet access via the phone may be nice to some but not to me that is just added expenses to my hefty monthly bill with at t to sum it up this phone is not the best there is out there but useful enough for my own needs I had buy another of this v3i hands down that is if i happen to have the extra cash to own a second unit with quadband frequencies it makes a good phone for travel outside america battery life is also a big plus some people could downplay this phone for what lacks but not me d,236,40
2374,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i have been using this product for over three years i have bought a new v3i a second time after two years of use of an old v3i compared to the new motorola v9 as well as countless other new phones on the market the v3i still retains it is glamour as the v3i was marketed as a top-notch phone it has longer battery life than the v9 and has all the features that are necessary in a cell phone the durability of the v3i is also excellent cell phones with too many integrated electronics will be damaged easily i had my first v3i crushed slightly by a car that drove too close to the curb the front screen was slightly cracked but the ballistic durability of the hard plastic is still surprising the phone still worked perfectly i then bought my second v3i and fixed the old v3i all the store had to do was replace the glass on the front screen and my old phone became as good as new again i prefer the unlocked international version which has slightly different menus and features and uses digital audio player instead of the apple itunes software,196,41
2375,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,i have to give motorola credit for the entire razr lineup because it is definitely the coolest phone I have ever seen it created the market and improved it on each iteration so design is five star without question the phone itself makes calls and the speakerphone is loud as it should be i love the exterior lcd screen and that is about it for likes the dislikes are numerous for me because i own a nokia 3650 which at the time was the best phone you could get 2003 now it is outdated but heres some interesting points my phone takes pictures of equal quality sound playback is equal to my phone i have unrestricted java applet usage including a much larger library of available programs my sync manager does much more than motorolas including much better integration with outlook my ui does not suck I have had my cell phone for five years which is an eternity for cell phones but it is still not out-featured by this phone i tried to get an ebook reader for a razr and all i could find were sites that basically make you compile a jar file and unlock your phone to transfer it where it may or may not run contrast with my nokia 3650 i downloaded a free ebook reader mobipocket using nokias software which can be downloaded for free from nokia and i was in business vendor lock-in for cell phones is a big problem for me and maybe it is for you too this is a stylish phone that epitomizes form over function c,261,42
2376,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i have now bought three v3i razrs in 6 months time and will never buy another one i let my dad try out my first one and he gave it back damaged i thought he just handled it rough because the paint rubbed off of the mouth piece area and the screen has a small crack in it i found out that this phone is just waaaay too flimsy for every day use my second one was crushed by my daughter and my third one already has a cracked front screen i have nohow the third one got cracked but i tried to protect it with a leather case i liked the features and function of the phone but ended up spending close to 600 and still do not have a presentable phone i recently bought a samsung blast because i have had much better luck with samung i still have samsung flip i bought 4 years ago and it still works great just no bluetooth if you want a phone sturdy enough for everyday use look for another phone,181,43
2377,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,good quad band phone with digital music player need to buy additional memory card to stre although,17,44
2378,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,great phone i currently use it in europe and in the united states amazon delivered it before the estimated shipping date,20,45
2379,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,just got this phone and used it for 1 day the battery fully charged overnight lasted about 8 hours with about 15 hours of talk time the phone is set up for some asian country it was a nightmare to program for web access and multimedia messaging the voice interface is horrendous the accent of the voice is very thick and it is very difficult to get it to recogize names in the phonebook additionally the call quality is poor it constantly sounded like it was on the fringes of a reception area even when showing 5 bars of signal strength i am an amateur radio operator and am thoroughly familiar with the vagaries of radio operation and this problem was definitely with the phone i have had a razr v3 for some time now and the interface is similar enough to be able to figure out but the phone is going back to amazon,155,46
2380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i never had a phone give so much trouble as this phone i brought this phone in october 2006 and it worked well initally but now less than one year after it acts crazy and you press one button the volume goes up and sometimes blanks out totally also the battery doe snot hold a charge for any lenght of time i regret buying this phone back to nokia for me please note i am not alone i have 2 friends experiencing the same problems,85,47
2381,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,i am using the cellphone in argentina and i can not send or recieve messages or see the number of an incoming call it may be because I am using it here the rest works perfectly,34,48
2382,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,everything good nicw work fast delivery nice cel everything i espected,15,49
2383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,i brought it last year because i do not want to carry an mp3 player and a phone at the same time i was extremely disappointed that when i brought the phone that it does not include itunes and it turns out that there are 2 different versions of v3i one with itunes installed and another with dap motorolas digital audio player i ended upgrading the phone with a firmware which allows you to have both itunes with 100 song limit and dap just google dmatt i got lucky and it comes with a 256 mb card but i upgraded to a far 512 mb microsd card by all means this does not replace an ipod or anything like that but i am not picky about mp3 players the itunes that it comes with is simple at best and it does not support some mp3 formats and i had to reencode them to make it work pros looks the same as the razr v3 allows you to sync with your outlook contacts and calendar bluetooth support call quality is pretty good mp3 with itunes not as good as ipod although cons nosupport sometimes you have to reboot the razr because it does not read the memory card transfer from pc to phone is slow,213,50
2384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i agree with the other reviewer that this phone stores the same contacts multiple times that is same name with cell home work and email address would be stored as 4 different entries so now if you have 100 contacts stored on your phone with four different numbers cell home work emailthere will be 400 entries stored in your phone and if you have to browse through then there are 400 entires to go through very very annoying feature did motorola ever tested this phone before releasing i guess not what a waste of money i am giving it 2 stars only because i am able to make phone calls with it,109,51
2385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,i have the v3i and it is a pretty cool piece of equipment but i still have not figure out how to use the itunes and other features from the phone,31,52
2386,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,the reviews are generally correct however this phone will not pair with a mac some i can not find which v3is do not work via bluetooth with macs according to web postings i was able to sync via usb easily and itunes also worked flawlessly i depend on bluetooth syncing however so was very disappointed,54,53
2387,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,ok this phone is a big disappointment the menus are horribly difficult to use and not user-friendly at all even after a while they simply are not logically organized it may be nice and thin which are the two main reasons for purchasing it but i find it confusing nokia has the best menus i thought ericson was bad but this really tops even them,65,54
2388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i just got my v3i at a bargain price as it is now an old model i just use it solely as a phone not intend to use the music player dc wap and more and find it to be a master piece it is also a collectable the battery life is excellent too as opposed to other comments get one fast while it is still available on the market,69,55
2389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,2.0,negative,i thought i would be getting a phone that was essentially the same as the one for sale in the cingular store when i got this one i found that there was no itunes player and in fact i could not find any music player at all the speed dial buttons continued to say they were empty when pushed despite the fact that the entries in the address book clearly listed the speed dials as assigned some of the network features did not work i suspect someone with ability to hack the phone may get this to work charger that came was large and bulky european version with and adaptor otherwise the phone was fine and funtional as far as i could tell just be sure you understand that all the features may not be the same as a us version,142,56
2390,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,i really wanted this phone and still love the design and features however i happened to get a phone with some of the problems other reviewers had noted the phone cuts off a lot with a white face display and no service indicator is embarrassing at times because i drop callers also the gunmetal finish is beginning to strip in small dots at places and has gotten 1 or so scratches i keep my phone in a padded case and am pretty gentle with it also the charger that came with it was for europe with an adaptor which seems to have a short so i had to buy an adaptor for united states so the above raises the issue of whether the value promised in view of the price charged by the manufacturer is given,135,57
2391,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,this is the first unlocked phone that I have bought from amazon the phone looks amazing and the motorola logo lights up blue which more people mention than all of the other features combinded the camera is upgraded but it is not too much of a difference than the normal ones the phone is pretty different than what i expected to get first of all the amazon phone does not ship with itunes but comes with the dap which i do not consider a problem because the itunes one has a song limit and this one does not the only things i am dissapointed with is that this one unlike cingulars one from the store does not ship with a microsd but you can buy a 1 gb on amazon for maybe 30 it is definitely not for america because it shipped with multiple language manuals and an adaptor for the charger stil a pretty good buy because it is unlocked and it costs less than the cingular v3i with no contract it still costs less even if you signed up for a 1yr contract,178,58
2392,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,this is by far the best phone i ever owned the features on this phone are great the phone looks awesome too better than the v3 pros itunes music player pretty loud speaker 13mp camera great reception great screen cons can only download aac format songs takes a long time sometimes to download music other then that this phone is awesome and i recommend it to anyone,67,59
2393,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,i have not use it yet because I am still in the us and i bought it to use it in venezuela but as far as I have cheked it it looks like is in great conditions and working perfectly it is very elegant and sharp looking and the graphic interface is great and very easy to use,54,60
2394,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,nicedark grey purple the unit is not a us model it has an adapter to plug it in it will not send pictures or text with t mobile as it is not one of their phones it does work for the sim card,44,61

2396,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,this is the best phone i ever owned reception is very good battery life is good ring is audible and quality of voice is very good mine already came with ear phone usb cable leather case and 256 mb memory card there are a few things that are not so good need to clean cover frequently it gets easily smudged mp3 sound is not perfect well this is a phone not a mp3 player once when i switched the gsm card it reverted to kanji characters and i had a hard time to find the english option,100,63
2397,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,it works in us but the charger comes as european charger with a us adapter it is strange that amazon is selling this phone only to the united states when it is a non united states phone the most important feature it is missing for me is the autoupdate date / time from the network or service provider according to motorola it because it is not a us phone it is frustrating if you travel and the clock does not update,73,64
2398,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,my post is mainly for the bad review given by giovanni i got my razr v3i for my wife and got it from ebay mine is not defintely for american but in any case i do not have any problem with 1 isync so no need to edit but i agree with denomalizing this is same as other moto phone 2 no hard reset so far 3 itunes works with no problem itunes m4p also works in fact the only reason i bought this is itunes but i have to add sound quality is mediocre it does not matter with my wife since she does not have keen ear in ebay there are some items instructions to add itunes to this phone at 10 - 30 dollars i did not try it yet and i did not hear the success story but it seems to me that it is possible to add even if it only has motos mp3 player so basically i do not have any significant problem and i did not pay 349 my complaint would be no regular headphone jack and no bluetooth ad2p profile i got the phone ebay 1gig transflash sd amazon and stereo headphone from ebay and three year warranty from ebay and in total i paid 300 i do not think it is much cheaper than ipod nano cheap phone but it is very nice to have two in one piece,235,65
2399,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,i purchased this phone unlocked about two months ago i am not sure why it is not readily available in any us store there seems to be a lot of confusion out there about this phone the v3i is awesome hands down the best cell phone device that i have ever purchased the itunes capability is great even although the song limit is 50 it works great as an ipod back up the sound is as good as you can expect and you can listen to your itunes songs over the speaker without having to use any headphones the best thing about this phone is the removable transflash card that can be used up to 1 gb that can be used to store songs use as a thumb drive or whatever you would need a 1 gb worth of space for in addition the one megapixel camera is a definite upgrade from the old v3 also the video capability is awesome unlike it is predecessors the v3i will take as long of video as your memory will hold three minutes thirty minutesthe looks and feel of this phone are amazing too the gunmetal look stands out among the sea of normal razr phones also i love the front blue light which you can program to flash differently for different things the only problem with the phone is the fact that you can not purchase it at any united states phone dealers you either have to purchase it here or someplace like ebay i purchased mine on ebay for about 250 go for this one you will not be disappointed,266,66
2400,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,i just gave it one star because i know that when you look for reviews people look at the bad reviews so i wanted to catch your attention this is a perfect phone i can not believe the nonsense people write here i was afraid that when i will buy it i will not have the ability to search people or to pick up the phone with out hitting the speaker phone up until know i still do not understand what the he shall they where talking bout the speaker phone button is inside the phone there is no way of pushing it plus you can not put any button on the side unless you are total clumsy when you want to search people you can search them in two ways like in nokia or search engine i really do not understand the people who write here maybe they talk about the older v3 model,152,67
2401,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,well i just recived my motorola razor v3i and for some reason the sender found it nessicary not to send me half of the accessories i needed for my phone to work in the mannor it was ment for and to top it off they do not have a way for me to contact them for me to recive the rest of the things they neglected to send me so i do not recommend buying this product from this site if they railroaded me with their hijinx who knows who else they are tying to give the shaft to,99,68
2402,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,the phone is sick i found it more like a device to get girls the phone looks sexier than any other models you like only problem is my ear piece broke so i had to use the speaker everytime i make a phone call other than that it is a cool phone people give this phone horroble ratings because of one thing like the first one who rated this phone on amazon he said the voice recognition sucks yes at first i had trouble with it but the trick is you have to speak the word correctly and how you would actually say it talk like the phone does,108,69

2405,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,1.0,negative,if you choose english as your language then the system does not allow you to customize voice settings for each name on your phonebook the built in voice recognition system attempts pathetically to mismatch with any available name in the previous razr we could go to individual phone numbers assign a voice to that number motorola has really smart hardware engineers and but some really dumb ones who believe that all worlds english speakers have certain type of enunciation modulation and speed,82,72
2406,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,excellent phone overall with one limitation unless i am doing something wrong when you start search you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it will take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter but no second letter search to narrow the look up eg if i am looking for moly i will get all the ms and will have to scroll down from ma all the way to mo is that a good thing or am i wrong,93,73
2456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,i just got my black motorola h3 design it looks aesthetically pleasing actually awesome the overseas model has a rubberized finish whereas the us model is metallic this applies to both black and silver models pairing it works fine with my nokia 6230i just a breeze to start using it just follow the quick steps in the manual feel it has a solid feel the buttons are quite hard to press infact so hard hat u have to use both ur hands to actually get a grip of them i would suggest setting the volume to the maximum before using the headset the on / off button in the center works flawlessly and is not that hard to press the handset does not give a good grip over the ear and it feels like it is gon na fall off this is becasue of it is over-the-ear design quality the reception is great even when a few feet away however a wall or similar will because a little disturbance static that is how bluetooth functions and is not a headset problem the other party has not experienced an echo problem yet when i have spoken to them so conclusion the blend of price looks and functionality all force me to rate it a 4-star,208,0
2457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,i have a nokia 6230 and purchased this headset from compusa recently used to have a nokia hdw-3 but the battery died and unable to find a cheap replacement battery pros the unit is solidly made and easy to setup the mute function work well the volume is good no dsp and sound quality matches my old nokia unlike a lot of loop headsets this does not seem like it will break / fall off as i tend to put it in my pocket when unused pairs fine with my mac and you can turn off the blue light if needed charger is a small flip-prong type and reasonable at 2 hours to charge battery talk time is good although it is unclear what type of battery it has internally the audio cues are fairly logical cons not the most comfortable headset I have tried prefer the in-ear like the sony hbh-iv835 but i decided to keep this one instead as dsp might suck,158,1
2458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,strengths work perfect with my motorola razr v3 slim sleek sexy great speaker and mic weaknesses did not connect with my laptop not a lot of features on off switch is kind weird volume buttom does not work well summary edited march 29th by ahsan khurshid i just received the headset and work perfectly with cell but they mentioned it works with pc as well but due to some reason i could not make it connect with my laptop i don know i was assuming it will work may be i am doing some thing wrong volume button does not turn up or down normally even after we keep it pressed some time it works some time does not i don know may be there is some technique to do it perfectly i mean when we are in conversation we want to increase or decrees volume with out taking off the headset anyway so far this is kind of ve point for the headset anyway over all this is a great cool bluetooth gadget have one recomended,181,2
2459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,overall this works pretty good it rarely gets confused like a lot of the headsets with only one button do my main complaint is that the volume just is not very loud even turned up on maximum and that makes it very hard to use in the car when you have a lot of road noise or rain and more,56,3
2460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,I have had this headset for about a year now i use it with a razr it is a fine headset from a technical perspective the sound is fine it is easy to pair and use and more i have not run into any problems using it in a car or out of doors however it is really not very comfortable the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff andi would not want to wear it for a long call more than 15 - 20min say for comfort and performance consider the plantronics voyager 510 around 50 at amazon I have had one of those now used by my son and it is excellent if you are into new gadgets check out the jawbone sets i have not used one but a colleague swears by the one he has been using for a couple of months,141,4
2461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,thathas disappointed me at the sound quailty too much noise and unclear sound after trying 1 week i never use it again,24,5
2462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,i broke my other bt and was looking for a cheaper yet good alternative i read some tech reviews and would agree that the call quality is pretty good i have not experienced any static or echos like some others have mentioned my only big complaint is the buttons are hard to access the volume buttons ar on the top and bottom like my old unit but these one are set in some that makes it hard for pressing them if you have larger sized fingers like myself simply being a guy the other button is the call / function button that is the back panel you see in the photos it is difficult because it is towards the back instead of the center like it should be resulting in the earpiece tilting off of your ear when having to push it it also is a firm button which i doubt loosens up after more use I am not going to complain anymore although because for the price it is a reasonable bt,166,6
2463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,i bought the h3 after losing my motorola h500 i found that the range is terrible i know bluetooth headsets do not have great range but i get static on this one if i turn my head for crying out loud if i have my phone in my pocket it has to be in the pocket on the same side of my body as the headset to avoid terrible static also it really hurt my ear to wear it at first i guess i suffered through it and am now used to it but it hurt a lot at first i just does not have the same rubber cushioning as the others i should have just bought another h500,117,7
2464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,got the h3 two months ago paid 9 more than todays price it is a decent unit but there are some drawbacks the earhook does not make for a secure fit to your ear but that is an issue for most bt headsets sometimes my h3 will not boot on the first key press after a recharge or sitting in a warm car for a few hours occasionally there has an echo on dialed calls and the call key requires a firm push if you are not careful powering the unit off you might inadvertently redial the last number instead,94,8
2465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,do not get me wrong the h3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back what i mean by that is that when your on the phone the other party hears an echo this happend on all the calls the only thing that kept me from returning it was that i lost the receipt and i threw away the box i do not recomend wasting your money on this one you may try that has worked for me is the h500 cheap looks ok and best of all it works oh yeah my razor had a hard time linking to the h3,103,9
2466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,i got this headset in a package deal with a motorola v3 razr phone sign up for service get the phone and the headset free initially i was very satisfied it is light fit my ear well and i could hear callers as if they were right next to me but i was told by everyone i talked to using this headset that their side of the conversation had a very pronounced delayed echo i tried re-pairing it with the phone re-charging the battery in the headset and the phone did not help i also had issues with it not recognizing my phone when i tried to turn it on this happened several times and i had to re-pair it with the phone each time which was a total pain i had some difficulty answering incoming calls with it also as the button is a multi-function button which uses a series of beeps to let you know what function it is on kinda sounded like r2d2 from star wars not fun to try to interpret while barreling down the interstate with a ringing phone in my purse since these were issues i was not willing to put up with from a device that is supposed to make my life easier i have since replaced it with a motorola h700 which i am much happier with guess i know why the h3 was free with plan activation lesson learned,237,10
2467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,echo and resound unusable the person on other end of the call will never talk to you again it is in trash now,23,11
2468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,once you start talking on the phone using a bluetooth headset you will not want to go back to holding a phone to your ear the motorola h3 bluetooth headset is a must have i use it with my razr and the sound quality is great voice dialing with the h3 is a piece of cake it is perfect for use in the car and works great for me and i have a manual transmission I am getting about 8 hours of talk time on a charge well over a week on stand by pairing up with your razr is simple and takes about 30 seconds it is a little bigger and a little heavier than the h500 I am assuming they have the same electronic components in each and just a different cosmetic she shall i like the look of this h3 a little more than the h500 i like the shape better and it is not as shiny as my h500 but performance and battery life for each has been identical so no complaints here volume is excellent for use in any car with the windows rolled up true i could not use it in my miata with the top down traveling on the highway but i do not feel that is a reasonable request for any bluetooth headset one warning to possibly explain those reviews where buyers had issue with this device is to watch out for knock offs on e-bay although i purchased this on e-bay the second h500 i bought from e-bay is what i would say works like a chinese knock off it works but is unreliable it played the wrong tones to identify a function and too many tones when they were not required I am wondering if some of the complaints about this device are not related to knock off items,296,12
2469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,this bluetooth is very nice looking i like everything about it i got one for my girlfriend and she loves it the only thing i do not like about this headset is that if a person is using it outdoors it tends to have little stactic for the caller anyways not bad if you are indoors most of the time or in a car then this is a great headset for the price,70,13
2470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,well i ordered this headset because it matched my black razr i read all the reviews and ignored all the complaints of echos now my wife will not even talk to me if i use it the echo is horrible i called several other people and go the same complaint i am returning it after using it for 2 hours i would not recommend this one,66,14
2471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,tried pairing it with a treo 650 and red razr although pairing worked fine the other party heard an annoying buzz on both phones where as i could hear them clearly returned it to amazon for a full refund i gave it two stars because the headset seemed to work on my end,53,15
2472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,the on / off button hard to manage and not responsive very bad sound quality and loud echo that make people on the other end do not want to talk to me totally useless,31,16
2473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,out of the box mine had one of the buttons dead no click nothing when i returned it for exchange the saleperson said that is typical of this headset and only from motorola cellphones good h3 headset junk in fact he said that they cellular sales a verizon dealer store were dropping the motorola h3 because of the exceedingly high number of returns and were sticking with just the plantronics which i then had him exchange my shoddy h3 with so mine out of the box essentially doa with a major dealer dropping them because of this,98,17
2474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,I have been through a good couple of headsets in a short amount of time and i must say that this is the 1st one that has worked the best for me it is small and comfortable and the battery life is just right many if the others I have had like to die about 30 mins into a conversation also i can walk around my apt and even check my mail and still have a strong signal,75,18

2477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,i can not understand all the negativity about this earpiece / headset i have been through three other types and models and this is the best one for me so far i like the fact i can use the same charger for my motorola slvr 7l phone and this headset setting-up was a breeze easy to pair with the phone the on-off button is great the battery life lasts a long time even with my headset on most of the time and all the talking i do it lasts a long time on one charge i have had this model for two weeks now and i have had to charge this only twice once a week it fits great on my ear and has not fallen off yet it fits so well and comfortably it is so light that i wear it all day long and even sometimes i forget i am wearing it there has been a couple of cases where i experienced a little static but it never lasted very long i have had no problems with the volume or controls i hear great even while driving the sound quality is just great this is a great bluetooth headset i recomended it,200,21
2478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,i got this headset when i got my razr phone and loved the fact that i could use the same charger for the phone and the headset but that is about the best feature it has it did pair fine with my phone and it seems to last a long time on one charge the interface is ok but i still have not gotten used to switching calls when i would already be on it and get a second call i hung up on people often trying to do this the worst features are seemingly the most important this thing fits horribly on my ear and had a tendency to fall off the volume was so low that even at it is loudest i often had to press it to my ear to hear hands-free huh the worst was the static that either i would hear or the person i was talking to would hear nothing seemed to improve it i just lost this earpiece and i think it may have been a blessing in disguise I shall look for something a little better this time,182,22
2479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,when i visited a local retailer they told me this was the model of bluetooth headset that never gets returned by customers on that basis i decided to give it a try and now having used it for a week i can see why it is rarely returned sound quality is just fine for highway driving even with the volume a couple of notches lower than the maximum setting also i have large sticky-outy ears and even on me the headset is so light and fits so well that i can leave it on there all day i hardly notice it is there it stays on even if i swivel my head quickly when changing lanes i will not be returning mine either and would have no problem recommending this same model to others,131,23

2486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,style is nice it does mimic my razv but it feels like it is going to fall off my ear I am not sure if it is because of the size of my ears or what connection was very easy and the buttons are easy to use the person you are talking to comes in loud and clear loud and clear loud and clear oh that must be that darn echoe problem i hear no echoe but everyone i talked to complained of a poor connection or echoe this seemed to be a problem for both other cell phones and land lines,101,30
2487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,purchased the h3 to match up with my v3 razr which it does very well the h3 connects easily and quickly when turned on it is very comfortable and looks quite stylish two problems 1 the maximum volume level is too low this makes it difficult to use outdoors or in a car if wind and extraneous noise are present 2 the volume controls are tiny and dificult to use i leave mine set on the maximum and use the v3 volume control if necesary rarely to lower the level i like the h3 and intend to keep it for indoor use when outside or driving i use the cardo scala 500 which has great volume capability and wind noise protection the scala 500 is slightly less comfortable but overall performs far better,133,31

2666,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,it seems really strange that so many people had such a hard time with this product i purchased one of these for 70 6 months ago along with my verizon / motorolla razor phone and it is works great the set up is extremely easy and turning the phone on and off is extremely simple one button for those who said this is the picture of the h700 i can tell you right now that my h500 it has this name on the packaging and when i connect it to my phone is the exact same model as picturedbuttons and all the only thing i have to say is that the range may be considered short to some people i mainly use it while walking or in my room while I am doing paper work so it is never farther than 20 feet from the phone when you get about 25 ft or farther the voice quality becomes a little distorted and gets worse the farther you are the simple solution to this is to keep the phone in the room you are in or an adjacent one I have had this headset for half a year now and it is never given me any problems it has a very nice stand-by feature that conserves the battery when not in use and the battery life seems to be 2 - 3 times that of my phone the quality of sound is great I am a music student and often play new piano pieces I have written over the phone to friends and family and they never had a problem hearing the full range of notes clearly it is been the perfect headset for my needs the only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the range which is not an issue at all for myself although others may want a longer range,300,1

2668,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get a bluetooth headset for use with my new lg8300 unfortunately while i can hear everyone just fine my callers say they hear terrible distortion deep echoing and generally very poor call quality people have asked me to not call them on this headset it is really too bad with all of the hype and extra selling of bluetooth accessories so this was a wasted purchase as far as i am concerned I am not sure what the other two reviewers were saying but my h500 is exactly like the picture grade a for style grade d for utility,102,3
2669,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the h500 works well with my razr v3 but i can not seem to figure out how to use it with my hp l2000 notebook a connection is established but i do not hear a sound and my voice does not register in the microphone need help on this any takers please thanks,50,4
2670,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i just received my headset in the mail today it shipped fast was in good condition but it was not the headset featured in the picture now i was not too picky to begin with so i will be keeping the headset unless it malfunctions but it is false advertising to show a different product than the one labeled the picture is that of the motorola h700 apparently i am not alone in noticing and being affected by this problem please confirm what you are ordering with what the picture should look like before buying,94,5
2671,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the picture on theis that of a h700 i have called amazon a couple of times about this and they have no clue about this they have even said a week back that they will be changing this in their catalog but no changes yet someone from amazons team please care to update me i had to purchase another more expensive headset because i was not sure what i would get well they did say that i was not going to get the headset featured in the picture for sure,90,6
2672,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i love this product the company was prompt in shipping and everything was perfect i can not believe i survived before this headset,22,7
2673,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i owned one for many years and wanted to find another one when i lost it well this one did not really work good i guess i need to find a new one that is updated i have tried the new ones that go into the ear and i do not like how they sit in the ear that was the jawbone and another i was not very happy with this used motorola h500,72,8
2674,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,lightweight connects with no problem lost one previously and was thankful that i could get another works fantastic,18,9
2675,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,shipped fast and nice price but no one can hear me on the thing very well surprising for an oem motorola device oh well it works well enough for what i bought it for answering the phone while I am driving or working and telling whoevers calling to leave me alone laughing out loud,51,10
2676,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,really liked how easy it was to set out and fits close mine and my wifes here well,18,11
2677,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,had trouble at first with getting it to work with my iphone but once i got it paired mine did not come with instructions it worked great no trouble with the volume being too low as i noticed with other peoples complaints i would recommend this,45,12
2678,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,do not know if people use bluetooths anymore but when i received this piece of crap i should have gotten my money back waste of money,25,13
2679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i got this bluetooth to help out when driving and talking on the phone it has a little noise but i have not seen a bluetooth out there that does not give you some noise,33,14
2680,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,in my opinion motorola bluetooth is the worse bluetooth ever is big and not fit ok in ears i do not recommend,21,15
2681,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,the product is amazing and the ease of use is stunning i would recommend to get this product it gets charged very soon the only thing is the call button is very sensitive,33,16
2682,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,although not the best and not the worst bt headset it worked often times it sounded as if the caller was speaking through foam with a low audible hiss the caller on the other ended heard us fine sometimes they said we sounded far away I have used multiple bt headsets thus the average score it works not the greatest clarity but not the worst,65,17
2683,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this headset does not even go into your ear fully which makes it hard to hear spend a little extra and get a jarba,23,18
2684,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is the only bluetooth i use it has the most comfortable and accessible device that does not rub my ear the wrong way one touch access calling and a host of other features has kept me with the motorola series on this design for several years have tried many but they bug me no end they either hurt my ear or they do not fit worth a flit d r raggy ragsdale,74,19
2685,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is an awesome product i have one already and purchased this for a friend of mine charges last long and it is very reliable,25,20
2686,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,the headset is exactly what i ordered and it works perfectly I am never disappointed with the product or the price,20,21
2687,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,1st ear piece i have owned so do not really have comparison i do know it is sometimes hard to hear and the othe person has alot of extra noise also,30,22
2688,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i went with the h500 rather than the h350 as i thought it was newer and the speaking might be picked up better it is actually raspy to listen on and my recepients say they are having trouble picking up my voice garbled and going in a out,48,23
2689,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i do not own this anymore i gave it to someone that did not have one for the time i had it it worked fine but i did not like the quality of the product i could not hear the other person and they could not hear me that well either,46,24
2690,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i find this very useful and am pleased with this product it is also safe to talk while driving which is very important,23,25
2691,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the audio is a little bit fuzzy but this is a great earpiece if you do not do a lot of calling on it i personally only rely on it in the car and even then seldom use it,38,26
2692,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought one of these for myself and gifted it twice to some others mine is red but this was the best before more current ones came out,28,27
2693,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i received was used ii had chipped paint ifis used please state it in the description of,21,28
2694,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this is not my first time owning a motorola bluetooth it is my favorite one the thing is it is not being sold in store anymore hence my purchase online when i ordered thisthe description said new however when i got it i noticed that theon it was faded and there was a scratch on it I have already contacted the seller and I am just waiting for a resolution I shall update my review once i have a resolution aside from the cosmetic flaws the bluetooth works fine it is clear and very easy to set up I am hoping i can get it replaced with a new one like i ordered update 12/28/12 hey kim we apologize for the inconvenience but it seems that we have just ran out stock in those new we can offer you a partial refund for your troubles please let us know what you rather do jayden when i placed my order it said new and they send me a used one their response is they have run out of new ones really then they are talking about giving me a partial refund unacceptable first and last time I shall order from this seller like i stated before the bluetooth works it is just used and that is not what i paid for my rating has nothing to do with the product it is all about the seller and the shady way they are trying to conduct business you can not advertise a product as new and ship something that is clearly used i understand that there are used products in like new condition or good condition however this was not the case you purchased 1 of motorola h500 bluetooth wireless headset soft black new,286,29
2695,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like everything in this bluetooth but it would have been perfect if apart of having a voice command asking you what number you want to call it would have a voice command telling you who is calling everything else is very good good volume clarity and reception,48,30
2696,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the bluetooth dose not connect to the phone when it should it takes too long for to connet so in my mind it is a piece of junk,28,31
2697,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,with this headset all you could hear was static never even the sound of a voice was disapointed in the product from the beginning the packaging was just the headset charger and instructions wrapped in plastic wrap just received the headset back from my son in law and am returning it,51,32
2698,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i used to have a motorola h500 which worked well for my phone unfortunately i misplaced it so i eventually bought another one via amazon when i got it it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound i thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away it did not this was suppose to be a brand new headset it is defective and i did not return it immediately so I am giving this supplier a 1 star,80,33
2699,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i had boughten this as a presnt to mymother because she was always on the phone due to work she loved it at first it was very simple to connect to your phone but when we went to try it out it did not work as well as i had hoped i had called her from the home phone and there was mainly just a lot of static i could here her but not very well when she had handed me the bluetooth headset i could hear very well but the other person on the other end of the phone line heard the same static i had previously we are still trying to fix it and might end up sending it back,123,34
2700,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,one seems to want a charge often but they both work with the phones well since they are for driving laws very suitable,21,35
2701,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,ordered this and loved it used it so much that i have already wore it out found another and purchased it,21,36
2702,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,works as intended but the volume is absolutely too soft to use in the car / noisy environment i find myself holding the bluetooth to up the volume which defeats the purpose of a headset in general I had advise going with something in-ear,41,37
2703,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought the h350 which works great but i found another place that sells it for a much lower price and free shippingis nice although,27,38
2704,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i have been using motorola blueteeth for some time now i prefer the kind that have the flip mic boom that automatically turns off the headset when closed for soooo many reasons however i kept having issues with the mic eventually ceasing to work at all i could hear the other person but they could not hear me at all i had one headset replaced on warranty but after the warranty ended on that headset it too ceased to work one day so i decided to try this headset the motorola h500 for the most part i can hear the person on the other end of the line just fine although i will admit that sometimes having the phone in a pocket is a bit more of a problem that it has been with other products however i get almost unanimous complaints about the quality of my voice to the recipient at the other end it works and is tolerable to some people who get used to it but i have almost had to stop using the headset so that people can understand me obviously this kind of defeats the purpose of having a headset the other major issue i have with this headset is that even if i turn it off before putting it in my pocket it will often press against something in my pocket long enough to turn itself on and the proceed to call someone unbeknownst to me with the flip boom this was not an issue but it is something to keep in mind with this model i plan to speak to motorola in the next day or two about the microphone audio quality maybe i just got a lemon but other than the eventual end of the microphone i much prefer the h810,299,39
2705,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have owned several bluetooth ear pieces over the years all different price range and brands first of all there is no point in buying any brand other than motorola none of the others regardless of price measure up secondly there is no point in buying anywhere but amazon no one not radio shack best buy office depot or any other chain comes close to the price available at amazoncom now for the h500 it is as good as the h800 i owned that died in a house flood and much more aesthetic than lower priced models it was easy to pair with my blackberry and like all motorola models is extremely simple to use if you want a medium priced well functioning easy to use bluetooth headset this is the one to buy,134,40
2706,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,it works took me a little bit to figure out how to fit it on my ear but once i got that down no problem,26,41
2707,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i would not buy this product again it does work although but with your handset in your pocket things start to get scratchy pay a few more bucks and get a 700 series,33,42
2708,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,ordered thison the suggestion of a friend he was very right it works great and is very comfortable to wear,22,43
2709,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i liked it so far i did nt face any problems when the charge is less the voice clarity seems to be less,23,44
2710,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,bought this blu-tooth to replace another that was uncomfortable the outside the ear design works great for me light weight i hardly notice it is there,26,45
2711,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,this bluetooths quality is comparable to it is relative price you get what you pay for there is a large amount of static and a lot of back ground noise present when using it what upset me the most about it however is that the ear hook has broke after about a week,52,46
2712,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the one i got was ok but I had rather a different one i could hear others and others could hear me fairly well sometimes i needed to speak louder than usual the worst problem with it was it did not stay on my ear securely the unit sits on the outside of the ear with the loop that goes above the ear but if i turned my head quickly it would swing out slightly and then bounce back on to my head and the person you were talking to could here a bump i do not like worrying if this one will fall off my face,104,47
2713,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,motorola makes a good product but there are better bluetooth devices out there i found the h500 not comfortable it does not fit around your ear properly it falls easily off your ear and the reception is not all that good,39,48
2714,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought this for my wife to use with her motorola w755 phone it was a great buy she is very pleased with it the sound is very clear and it has great battery life also it was very easy to set up we put off buying a bluetooth because of the cost but for about 20 including shipping why wait any longer,63,49
2715,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,it acted as thought it was muted when it was not i tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones the person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it i did try to turn the mute off all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard,63,50
2716,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have owned this headset for about 3 years now the great thing about it is the clearity of the sound and the fact that i can also play music on my phone and listen to it through the earpiece it can get a little uncomfortable and the battery life is really short i use it while driving so my usage is not very long if your like me this will do the job,73,51
2717,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,got this headset because my old one was hurting my ear something awful one of those that you have to ram into your ear to get it to stay i love this little thing it is very comfortable it just hangs against your ear and almost feels like it is not even there usability is easy it just simply does it is job wonderfully,61,52
2718,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this product was good till a few days later when the i make a call the other person hears alot of back ground noise and interference went after my refund not that good,33,53
2719,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,my husband is enjoying this headset he recently dropped it in water and dried it with a hairdryer it still continues to perform correctly,24,54
2720,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,I have seen others for a higher price but this is a good product volume could go a little higher but I am a bit hard of hearing anyway,27,55
2721,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,for under 20 this blow the over-priced jabras out of the water i can actually hear other people talk without holding the ear piece in my ear battery lasts a couple of weeks without recharging,35,56
2722,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bougth this handsfree because i need to use the phone when i drive and works well and the battery charge duration is high,24,57
2723,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i can not even rate him on the product because i have not even recieved thethat i ordered from him in the middle of april i do not know what the hold up is but i sent whomever a email and i still have not heard back from them either customer service with these individuals is not really up there for me,59,58
2724,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i had brought the pink motorola ear piece and when a friend saw mine and asked how it worked i said comfortable and great they wanted me to order them one so this is the second order of this product,40,59
2725,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i got this for my boyfriend now that ca has the hands free law while driving he loves this earpiece it is way better than the plantronics one i bought for myself on a lightning deal and it was cheaper sometimes his phone does not get reception in our apartment and he will actually use the bluetooth because it gets better signal so this earpiece actually improves is phone in bad reception areas best purchase I have made and the shipping was super fast it arrived in only a few days,87,60
2726,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i have used this bluetooth a couple of times in good reception areas and those times each person i talked to said i did not sounds as good as i could on a bluetooth on my end i hear alot of noise background like an airy sound motorola makes better bluetooth devices so do not waste your money on this one you get what you pay for,63,61
2727,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have never used bluetooth devices before so i was a little worried since this one was so inexpensive it was super easy to install and i have not have any problems hearing or being heard during a conversation i am very happy with thisand i would suggest it too my friends,53,62
2728,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied with my blue tooth i purchased from amazon the length of time i ordered and recieved it was quick also the blue tooth was new in good condition i am very satisfied with amazon i have ordered more items and got them quick and in good condition,51,63
2729,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,it works well with my motorola phone clear and easy to use the only problem i have is that it pinches my ear and after wearing it for a while my ear gets sore i only wear it when i am driving so i can deal with it,48,64
2730,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the price was right and the bluetoothworks very well i have no problem recomending it harry,18,65
2731,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i really like this headset i use it for my phone and ps3 it works great i love it i have not had a problem with anything,26,66
2732,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,functions ok not great ok it is older technology biggest flaw I am going to is poorly designed main control button if it was recessed it might be ok as it is the button is easily engaged unintentionally even in the moto belt clip case specifically designed for this hardware it accidentally activates and you are left wondering why your phone says connected but you can not hear anyone good price here much less than i paid years ago decent value worked fine w / moto razor synced up with my new blackberry no problem if you keep it somewhere when it is not on your head where it will not activate spontaneously it should get the job done,115,67
2733,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,ok so i have had several nice bluetooth headsets in the past I am a heavy user and needed a spare so i picked up this one because i could not pass up on the cost savings and the other reviews for this product were decent after 2 weeks all i can say is if you are looking for a good bluetooth pass this up and she shall out the 40 or more dollars to get a better one cons several times my connection has dropped mid-call for no reason about 5 times over 2000 minutes of use should you ever drop that call there is no way for you to reconnect without hanging up on the call and dialing that person / conference back you can not have the volume turned all the way up which is sometimes necessary to hear properly that is conference calls the other person will get their own feedback pros price it does work and call quality is clear it is still better than using wired headphones when it works,173,68
2734,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this is a fairly good bluetooth headset very easy to use and it feels comfortable when placed on the ear audio quality is good as well as the mic the earpiece although felt a little bit flimsy and would not stay on my ear properly the one thing although that i had a problem with was the battery life on the headset i got barely 2 full hours of talk time before it started beeping like crazy which meant that i had to charge it soon,86,69
2735,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,as mentioned by others i have zero problem hearing or being heard with this unit it is easy to use compact and fits in my pocket without problem my razr likes it as well my only problem is that my fingers are fairly beefy and the volume buttons are tiny for my fingers still i manage with care to make the thing work for me with few problems overall I have been extremely pleased particularly given the price much more than one would have expected for this very low dollar amount,89,70
2736,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i got this product fast the first day that amazon said that i would i took it out of the package clear she shall bubble and pluged it in to charge comes with a black motorola charger for the two hours it asked for and went to my phone told it to find it it synced flawlessly i have been using it for a day now placed three calls and received five no complaints everyone could hear me and i could definitely hear them i own an i335 from boost if your looking for a low priced headset you can get this one,103,71
2737,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,it is fine but tends to come on easily in the carry case people i speak with complain of tinny sound,21,72
2738,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this blue tooth head set orks great with my motorola phone only problem is it is backside hook is not feixible if it does not fit your eye lobe size you can use this fortunately it fits mine almost so i can use it if you are buying a blue tooth make sure you try it on before you buy it,60,73
2739,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,this blue tooth is a great deal for the price it works very well and i can hear people loud and clear I have had no problem with them hearing me and it fits very comfortably in the ear it is worth buying the only problem is it turns on way too easy because of where the power button is if i have it in my pocket it answers the phone all time even when I have shut it off many times I have answered my phone and could not hear anyone talking then i hear a strange sound coming from my pocket just to find that my bluetooth answered even although i had turned the power off and i do not wear tight jeans extremely annoying but it was a great price so i think I shall just leave it in the car from now on i do not regret buying it,146,74
2740,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i will be honest for the price i was not expecting too much it is sooo comfy on my tiny ears it sounds so clear and everyone hears me just fine well worth buying,33,75
2741,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this unit sucks threw it in the trash i should have read the other reviews before i ordered,18,76
2742,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i bought it cos was cheap i sold it already it did work as i expected,16,77
2743,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,they shipment was very fast and it product was wonderful would order from them again,15,78
2744,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the motorola h500 bluetooth is bulky and has a poor sound quality i wold not recommend it,17,79
2745,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this items was horrible the sound quality was poor with static and the bluetooth hung off the ear falling off i returned and would only recommend purchasing bluetooths with adjustable ear and not ordering online go to a store to try on the product,43,80
2746,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i purchased the motorola h500 because i had another one just like it i was not as happy with this one when i talk to other people they tell me they hear a hum throughout the conversation I am not sure why it is doing that I am not sure if anyone should buy the same one i did,56,81
2747,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,to own a bluetooth headset the right fit is essential for me this one lacked comfort maybe it is the shape of my ear but it just never felt sturdy on my ear switching from one ear to the other is very simple although pairing is very easy as well volume is quite low for me even at it is highest level when talking to someone they usually tell me that they can not hear me clearly as if I am very far away i can not hear the other person very clearly either unless i push the headset against my hear with my hand kind of a bummer when you buy one to be hands-free when a call comes in the headset makes it is own sound to notify you which is nice however overall i do not like it there are better headsets out there so i suggest you pass on this one,145,82
2748,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i have two of these models one has the more talk time both are not very good i can hear people fine but others have a very hard time hearing me i even tried it on a razr new chocolate lg and now an env2 it is not the phones it is the headsets do not buy this one or any on that looks like or similar to this,66,83
2749,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this headset was comfortable easy to pair easy to use looks nice and has a simple design and setup i also had no problems hearing the other person on the line however the person on the other line said i sounded like i was down in a well haha so overall it is not crystal clear quality for the other person especially if they are not on a landline however this is a very simple headset that gets the job done it is also very reasonably priced,84,84
2750,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i owned one of these before the same model and for some reason this one has some much static the other person can not hear you i am very sorry that i lost my old one and tried to replace it with this one i wish there was a way for me to return it,55,85
2751,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i only bought a bluetooth headset because of the new handsfree law in california i only charge it once a week and it lives in my car for the rest of the time i have had it for about a month and there are no problems with it,48,86
2752,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have been using this headset for a month and basically am happy with the purchase it is easy to use and works reliably the only complaint i have is the ear hook is a bit loose and tends to fall off if imy head to one side while talking,51,87
2753,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,title really says it all this is a decent product for the cost works fine minimal needs,17,88
2754,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought this unit to replace the nokia unit i lost over a holiday I am not fond of fancy features and originally bought the h350 at best buy for twice the price of this h500 i have a nokia 6103 and it intitally took about 5 tries to link it to my phone but it works fine now voices can be heard clearly simple answer / call button and so far the battery life is better than expected I have only had it a few days although so time will tell volume buttons are straightforward and the blue status light is a nice touch can be distracting to some there is some slight crackle and distortion even when in close range to the phone possibly from static electricity or other isolated em interference where i was using it but it was never enough to be troublesome it is light clips securely to the ear is symmetrical for left / right wear has a soft coating and I have been wearing it all day without any discomfort i bought this directly from amazon and had it in 3 days overall a fine unit at a great price,191,89
2755,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i bought this headset so that i can use with my ps3 and play online at 1st it was great no problems after about a week of use i started to experience more and more complaints about static also it disconnects wayyyy to much i would say to go for a wired headset instead overall although it did what it was suppose to do,64,90
2756,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,product is fine only problem i talk at a good level for people to hear me over the blue tooth and they have trouble hearing me and frequesnt clicks and pops occur besides that great product,36,91
2757,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this is a reasonably good product at a very reasonable price less than 30 here on amazon i would feel less impressed if I had paid 75 at a verizion store it was very easy to set up with a rzrv3 works fairly well long battery life my only complaint is that it is very easy for me to hit the answer button a fraction too long and get last number re-dial instead that being said i am happy with the performance for the price and would recomend highly for a first timer or non-techie,100,92
2758,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,first time i answered a call i could not believe the clarity on the headset it is easier and faster to answer a call with a click than searching for your phone i wear glasses and one is thin rim and one is thick I am able to use both with my headset and have no problem i highly recommend the h500 yours truly mr orta,63,93
2759,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,I have ordered a few of these before for me and my mother inlaw they worked great but these last two i purchased have taken a serious nose dive in sound quality voices comming through the headset are now very distorted and i have to ask people to repeat themselves alot I am only keeping mine till i can find a better one then I am tossing it my wife was so frustrated with hers she will not even touch it,77,94
2760,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i recommend it to anyone that wants a cheap bluetooth head set it is a little bit loose on my ear but it works perfectly,25,95
2761,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i purchased three of these from amazon for my two sony ericsson w580is and one samsung a737 all three paired quickly and correctly the only problem was that there was constant buzzing heard by the person receiving the call from all three cell phones as a test i paired all three of my cell phones with my existing samsung wep200 bluetooth headset instead no buzzing from any of the phones i ended up returning all three h500s and purchased the wep200s instead i do not know if the three i received were defective but for sure there were not compatible with my cell phones,104,96
2762,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i get tones of people complaining that I am muffled or asking if I am behind a cloth i also get the question asking how far away from the phone are you a good bluetooth is one that the receiver of the call can not tell your using,45,97
2763,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,not the worst thing around but still a bit awkward sometimes i would have difficulty turning it on / off as the device would bounce to another command on the multi-function key also while it was comfortable it was not very stable I had put my sunglasses on or pull them off and have to readjust the devices placement or risk it falling off it always felt a bit unstable anyways unless i did not have my sunglasses on but living in southern california sunglasses are a daily necessity,84,98
2764,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i would have liked to have knowen that the blue tooth motorola h500 was peace of carp and did not work for carp befor i bought it i found that the prices on amz are inflated i was looking at grills and seen a charcoal grill for 13500 i found the same grill at our local store for 2499 so i do not trust amz anylonger,65,99
2765,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,the price was right but i would go with something smaller next time does not sit on my ear too good last a good amount of time,26,100
2766,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought this headset thinking it would not be as good as some others but when i got it and gave it a go it works great sometimes there has static that comes through and wind causes problems if you have your windows down while you are driving other than that it is a great headset,52,101
2767,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is an excellent headset for the price the controls area easy to use and the microphone is great you do have to talk up a little but not that much my only complaint is that if i stick it in my pocket it has a tendency to turn on and make random phone calls,55,102
2768,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my husband I am very please and so is he thank you mercedes,17,103
2769,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this bluetooth was my first and worst i could not hear alot on it and it did not stay on my ear for nothing i would stay away,26,104
2770,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the only upside to this product was the ease in pairing it with my motorola q perhaps i have abnormal ears but i could never manage to successfully wear this headset i tried it on both ears but it never stayed still it was always flapping around on the side of my head because i never got a firm fit i had to turn the volume all the way up to use it but it still was not loud enough if you wear glasses or have small ears assume you will have the same problems I have owned the product for nearly a year and have used it about 4 times in total absolutely not worth any price even if the phone store gives it to you for free,128,105
2771,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,while i will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit if you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times but if you want to turn it off that is a whole different story powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function i have frequently called someone just by trying to turn off the device the button is also entirely too sensitive I have had the device in my cargo pants pocket where this would be very little pressure on the device and the unit has turned on and actually called someone other issues are the charging indication is not real clear and there is not anyof knowing how charged the battery is and the device is not quite as comfortable as other devices that i have used it is bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money,219,106
2772,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i love the convenience of this product however the people i speak to using this product report a constant buzzing they frequently ask me to pick up the phone and turn off the bluetooth i also have difficulty figuring out if it is on or not i will think it is on and make the call only to figure out the person is on the handset and when i try to activate mid call it hangs up on them 75 of the time,82,107
2773,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this bluetooth sucks i have to yell for people to hear me people always complain of hearing static from my end it is easier to use speakerphone on the handset rather than using the headset,34,108
2774,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i actually bought this headset to pair with my ps3 for online chat i have to say syncing it was a breeze and i did not experience any problems i have not tried it with a phone but i have the h550 paired with my lg vx8700 and i love it i was able to pick this headset up at radio shack for 20,61,109
2775,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,in contrast to the other katillion ear buds that basically do not work or are frustratingly uncomfortable this little gem is easy to use and nice to wear i misplaced my first one and bought another highly recommended,38,110
2776,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,light weight easy to use one charge last very long that you end up forget it needs power,18,111
2777,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,I have had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear it appears to wobble around the ear and leaves me with the feeling that it is going to fall off at any time i wear eyeglasses and the fit is very poor there are many better headsets out there that fit more comfortably and do not leave you wondering what is going to happen,75,112
2778,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i had one but ordered this one for my husband to give him freedom while driving and doing chores around the house he loves his as much as i love mine and now i do not have to share,38,113
2779,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought this to replace another unit that was hurting my ear one of those that wrap around and have a small rubber piece that goes inside your ear it is very light and comfortable to wear and with easy access to volume / answer / end / mute buttons sounds good and holds it is charge well the trade-off between this type and those that wrap around your eat is that the former can flop around if you are leaning to one side and/or jogging / running but who talks while doing that on the other hand i prefer this kind because nothing enters your ear and they are more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time i use mine when sitting at the computer and/or doing other tasks around the house or while driving / walking it works great in any of those scenarios,136,114
2780,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,love this headset as stated above i returned the plantronics model that everybody was raving about the only model more archaic than the plantronics 510 would have to be one of those hideous jabra models the motorola is the headset i wish I had bought the 1st time around it is suprisingly comfortable and does not take long to forget you are wearing it there is no intrusion into the ear canal allowing full air circulation and unhampered hearing of your surroundings the earhook is slim and does not interfere with wearing sunglasses which is something i can not say about the plantronics 510 pairing was a snap with my sanyo 7050 mil-spec phone i was willing to spend more for a headset however this one meets my needs I am happy,128,115
2781,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is the best bluetooth i have owned sound is clear and i rarely lose the connection like i have with previous units highly recommend it,26,116
2782,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i ordered this product expecting a new one as mentioned but instead i received a used product with a flimsy packing they did not even send me a sales receiptthis product looks like a refurbished one which was not mentioned intiallyotherwise it works ok,43,117
2783,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,purchased this headset for use with the ps3 and it works flawlessly with most games the only issues i have had is with it going to sleep while playing resistance if there was someway to program the headset so that this feature could be turned off it would be nice matches the ps3 inand has worked both with my computer and cell phones bluetooth feature so a very reliable headset good battery life clear reception and a great price make this a must buy,86,118
2784,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i have to say that this is my first bluetooth product so i have nothing to compare it to that being said i will put in my 2 cents on this one my biggest complaint is that is does not fit tightly to my ear kind of flops around and i have a hard time hearing sometimes i only use it in my car so it does what i need right now but i would not wear it anywhere else for fear it would fall off it does hold a charge for a good while and people seem to be able to hear me ok so it does have some good points i am very petite so maybe a bigger person would have more luck with the fit,128,119
2785,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my wife for the convenience of having her hands free while driving or in the kitchen or working in the yard my first bluetooth was this model but when i used it people complained that the mike picked up too much ambient noise and had a noticeable echo other than that one complaint everything else worked fine the range was as advertised as well as the talk and standby time the battery charged quickly and lasted for several days depending on how much i talked of course and it paired easily with the motorazr v3 m i upgraded to the h-700 because of it is noise suppression chip but was very disappointed with it the range was horrible and had to deal with a lot of static the noise suppression chip is worthless i retired the 700 and I am using something else now the h-500 headset is not the best one out there but for the money it is better than the h-700 hands down,167,120
2786,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,motorola h500 bluetooth headset soft touch black [ motorola retail packaging ] i love this bluetooth headset hands free is real good,24,121
2787,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,it is a good blue tooth but i can not say that i am overly impressed it sits on the outside of your ear not too firmly therefore while driving and turn your head quickly it shakes itself loose and is annoying the range is not too good as well i get alot of interference when my cellphone is in it is holster on my belt i usually have to bring the phone closer to the headset to get good reception i also tried using it as a earphone for an mp3 player / pda i have the sound quality is not good enough to listen to music otherwise it is ok i had a moto bluetooth i bought a few years ago and i am just disapointed that it is performance has not chnaged much,131,122
2788,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,I am so glad to have this bluetooth everyone should have one today there is not excuse to drive holding the phone in your hand when u can use these headset they are a must have and they are not expensive,40,123
2789,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i have been wanting a bluetooth headset for a long time i finally decided to invest some money into one and this is what i found it has worked perfectly ever since i received it in the mail the shipping was very prompt and fair overall because of amazoncom this was a great buying experience with a great product,59,124
2790,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i received the product a few weeks ago i immediately realized that it was not going to sit well on my ear and ever since then i have had trouble hearing from it i have to consistently push the bluetooth headset towards my ear to hear better i should have gotten the plantronics,53,125
2791,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this headset seems to be the preferred headset of my friends however whenever I am not in a dead-still silent room people have told me that I am completely unrecognizable this is especially the case when I am in my car granted i drive an acura rsx which is not known for it is quiet ride but nevertheless i need something better i tested it out once listening to messages that i left on other peoples voicemails and it sounds like i was in an underground cellar surrounded byso if you are going to be using this only only while in a dead silent room this is the way to go for ease of use if you are going to use it any other way try something better i still am personally researching what a good headset would be i may try the plantronics 510 or another more expensive plantronics i hear that the jawbone sounds good but is very poorly constructed,158,126
2792,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,the headset did everything i needed it to do for 30 less than what verizon was going to charge me for it so i call it a win-win on all fronts check it out,33,127
2793,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i got this from a company called globalizer out of the package i was able to charge it and pair it with my phone but the sound quality was poor and the device did not work as well as the one i got from the verizon store and ran through the washing machine for example it would not pickup phone calls or disconnect them using the headset button had to open the phone for those operations the company allowed me only to return the device at my expense for a replacement the sound quality of the replacement is better but it still will not pickup or disconnect using the headset button i also have difficulty getting starting and ending the bluetooth connection my advice it to purchase this unit at a store where you can easily return it rather than buying online,143,128
2794,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the motorola headset is no the best headset i have used but is ok the sound quality is not enough to rate a 5 star but i can give it a 4 star,33,129
2795,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i really wanted a bluetooth headset when i got my sch-u740 phone seeing a deal like this i could not pass it up easy to setup and sync with the phone i only have two problems with the headset 1 whenever i press the headset button to recieve a call there is a slight delay in answering this might be a problem with the phone and not the headset 2 it moves around a little too much for me sometimes when I am taking a turn in my car the headset will move a little bit same thing when i turn my head other than those little problems it is a bargain,109,130
2796,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,similiar to other comments the headset does not fit well too loose and flaps a bit when turning my head there are also times where i need to press the headset to my ear to hear the other person this can be annoying on a long conference call and takes away the virtue of being hands free,56,131
2797,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,for the money the hs500 works well the only thing that an expierenced user may notice is that the sound quality could be a little better but overall it is a good model for the money,35,132
2798,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like this product for it is obvious convenience and ease of usage the only reason why it is not getting 5 stars is I am use to the speaker to be a little louder and the maximum volume on this just is not enough and i find myself pushing it against my ear which totally defeats the purpose of handsfree besides that i really enjoy having this since i am a daily commuter if you plan on using this while driving then the volume issue may come into affect but it is really a personal preference if you are planning on using it mostly in a quiet environment then it is perfect range is great also,110,133
2799,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,worked as advertized usb charger great you do not need additional chargers works with other usb device chargers with same connectors clear sound and good controls for answering and volume,29,134
2800,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this headset is lite-weight and fits snugly on the ear the sound quality is excellent,15,135
2801,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this is probably a very good product as most motorola products are the one which i received however did not stay connected to the phone and it would dial the last called number on it is own it also would beep in your ear all of the time i sent it back and received a prompt refund including my shipping costs,60,136
2802,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,there is a lot of background noise the person on the other end has a hard time hearing what I am saying,21,137
2803,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i tried the unit to my surprise i thought it was cool but the person on the other end did not there is this terrible buzzing noise going on maybe the one i have is defective other than that i would recommend the product,44,138
2804,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this bluetooth worked ok for me but it just would not fit right for me it had a very loose fit so i exchanged it for the motorola h700 which is smaller and fits much better,35,139
2805,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the product hardly stays fit in the ear and both sound and microphone qualities are not so good i would not recommend it,23,140
2806,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,it works fine but sometimes it just stops linking my calls and i have to re sync it with my phone honestly sometimes i feel that i was safer in the car talking on my phone by my ear either way it is still really cool when it works,46,141
2807,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i am extremely happy with the headset i received and e-tronics has such great customer service it was no joke a pleasure doing business with them thanks,27,142
2808,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,headset is great in the car or in the house when you are outside in the wind or at a noisy location it blows for my usage it works fine i originally bought this from the t-mobile store for about 2x the price on amazon i lost it so the better price made my anger from losing the headset a little better,61,143
2809,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,overall a great product i have the motorola razr phone so i originally bought the matching razr headset also made by motorola but as soon as i opened the package one of the volume buttons did not work i of course returned it and then decided to do some research to find what headsets had the best performance while researching i found that other people had encountered the non-working volume button issue with the razr headsets so you might want to stay away from those i ultimately decided on this headset based on these aspects light weight good battery life and good reviews durable good volume ease of use longevity the looks are pretty good too i read many reviews on all different models and overall what i read about this headset was that it was pretty reliable and people were pleased with it plus the thing was like 30 with shipping i use it all the time no problems yet and no complaints,163,144
2810,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,very good headset the battery does not need to be recharged too often which is very convenient good sound quality the earhook is a little loose but that is not a major issue,31,145
2811,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,after a small amount of screwing around the h500 connected with my nokia n75 without a hitch i find that if you firmly place the ear loop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fits firmly and does not come loose i agree that the volume could go higher however in a quiet room it is adequate I am told that I am clearly heard on the other end of the connection this is also in a quiet room small and lite i think this a rather nifty piece of gear,94,146
2812,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,great product to buy for price i really recommend this product it was shipped promptly,15,147
2813,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,both my wife and i own these and we are both annoyed enough with them that i went out and bought her an old-school wired headset the other day to replace hers i dropped mine about a week in from four feet up onto pavement and the ear-clip chipped making it fall out from time to time definitely not rugged construction this unit picks up all kinds of background noise and garbles the voice so that you have to shout slowly to be understood at all in addition about 60 of the time when placing a call you will be able to hear the person you called but they will not be able to hear you at all and you will have to redial to get through,127,148
2814,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i recieved a defective h500 which i can not blame amazon for only motorola and the dealer amazon sent me a new bluetooth express delivery and i had it with in 3 days after i recieved the defective one they also paid for the shipping cost for the defective model i just want to commend amazon for their great customer service also the device works great there has a slight echo but i knew that when i bought it,77,149
2815,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,once i got used to wearing it i do not drive without it it was a great investment on my part i had priced them through cingular and it was double the price i am very pleased with my purchase,39,150
2816,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i use this in the car and people have trouble understanding what i say i always must shout to be heard it picks up a lot of backround noise it also mutes itself on answering and i get more hangfrom people who called and can not hear me respond try another model this was my first bluetooth headset purchase and I am looking at a different one,67,151
2817,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i bought this for my husband after i had gotten a bluetooth headset and loved it i got a different one palm one treo and i loved mine his is not good the piece behind the ear is not nearly as adjustable as mine is mine is moldable so you can sqeeze it and play with it until it fits the back of your ear this one is just what it looks like you can not quickly switch from one ear to the next on this one either i also liked mine because i was able to program different rings for different people or groups of people on my phone then when my earpiece would ring i could hear the different rings and know who was calling me without having to get my actual phone out of my purse his phone does that too but the headset only rings the main tone not the different rings it also picks up tons of background noise much more than mine when he has in his truck he has an old 1972 chevy all you hear is the loud engine if you are looking for just a basic headset that does not have many features then this is fine but if you want more for your money do not get it mine was the same price as this one,218,152
2818,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,first alittle backround i live in albuquerque new mexico and they just inforced a no driving with out a hands free device i would not have purchased a bluetooth headset other wise i hardly use it other than when I am driving the headset works and does it is thing but the volume even on it is highest setting is still to low to have the radio on or the windows down as a whole the headset works and does what it is supposed to,81,153
2819,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the sound quality is good however pairing is a problem many a times if the headset is fully discharged then you have to pair it again with your phone and it does not always works in the first attempt the biggest problem is the fit on your ear i have average earlobes and it never fitted comfortably i always had a feel that it will fall down this is especially a problem while driving as when you are taking a turn and looking on your sides moving your head fast you feel that the headset will fall off this is the most annoying thing it is not very sturdy product too the small little thing that fits in your ear it broke after two months only it simply fell on the floor in a store and the damn thing broke it can not even stand a simple fall from such small height man-height i would strongly suggest to find something more robust sturdy and one which can fit more better on your ears always first try in a store and make sure that it does not break easily,185,154
2820,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,wonderful transaction the product arrived quickly and was exactly what i wanted highly recommend the seller,16,155
2821,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,motorola puts out some very good products but this one motorola h500 headset was a real disappointment it is compact and easy to sync to a phone but the volume is way way too low to be useful in most stituations particularly traffic i have adjusted it a number of times to the highest setting and it is about half the volume of other bluetooth ear pieces i have good price poor buy,73,156
2822,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this headset fit great in my ear it is look is very cool but a few flaws 1 volume buttons are not easy to reach once the unit is fitted in your ear 2 using it in windy conditions may get you in an uncomfortable conversation hello are you there it feels like you are within a hurricane and i do not mean only outdoors you maybe inside your car with the a / c on and if it is blowing right at your face you will get this kind of problem,85,157
2823,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the headset produced static that could be heard by anyone i called they could not hear my voice over the static awful i bought this for the cheap price and would have given it to my daughter if it was merely not as good as i wanted it was awful and i returned it for credit,55,158

2830,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,[ ] when i received it it came with insructions of what to do it was no problem setting it up once i put it on it was light weight and i could hardly ntice it except sometimes it became loose and the link between the ps3 and the headset died i could hear people but i could not talk back also before using it i had to go to the menu for the ps3 to pick up the connection this only took a couple of second but i could have lived without it in other words this product is good with a strong connection but at times the link is dropped and your call may be dropped as well,118,165

2833,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i use this with my computer phone the quality is in and out for the sound sometimes it is great sometimes it is not my friends also complain of a reverb if i have the headset volume up too high the upside is that it does work for a good distance so i can leave the computer and not worry about loosing the signal probably would end up spending more next time to get a higher quality headset but for my uses right now it works just fine,86,168
2834,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,bought this ear piece for my on-the-go guy back in january and he loves it he says it is light weight and very practical since he is always on the road perhaps it is too light-weight although they have been a few times when he has been heading to the shower or to bed with it the plus for me i can still talk to him when hockey is on cuz he does not mind being on the phone o men,75,169
2835,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,I am very happy with the motorola h500 bluetooth headset it is easy to use and very comfortable to wear the one button to place or answer a call makes it easy to concentrate on driving still having both hands on the wheel and both eyes on the road while using the phone I am also very impressed with the clarity and sound of the ear piece i can hear the caller clearly even with the radio on and the microphone makes it possible to speak in a normal voice and still be heard i recommend it highly to anyone who uses a cell phone while driving no matter how often or infrequently you make calls,113,170
2836,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i received thisdoa i went through the process to send it back for a return it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received any form of correspondence from the seller,35,171

2844,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,the black headset we have had some problems with there is an echo and when it is not echoing we still have a problem of the volume on the other persons line they can never hear us we also have a pink h500 and that one works great there are no problems maybe we just got a bad one but other than that it is easy to use and it is small,69,179
2845,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i bought the motorola h500 bluetooth headset soft touch in black because i like to have both hands free while driving the headset does not always remain on my ear it may just be my ear shape it can be difficult to hear at times i just wish i would have looked into other options rather than following the bluetooth trend,61,180
2846,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,great deal great price works great clear sound very comfortable lightweight in fact i dropped mine in the grocery store parking lot and it was crushed i am looking to buy the exact same model i was so pleased,40,181
2847,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought this primarily to use with skype it works mostly good and it is b3etter than the h820 that i own however with skype the quality drops a little bit i am sort of satisfied with it but i still get static sometimes the bluetooth connector that came with it will not connect i had to buy a cheap bluetooth connector by logitechg,64,182

2849,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,while this device connected well with the razor cell phone it does not hold to your ear this inconvenience makes it somewhat useless,23,184
2850,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i could not live without it i had alot of trouble with the corded ear pieces because they really hurt my ears this product causes no pain i can usually hear just fine unless the person on the other side also has theirs on then i have to turn up the volume with this you can flip the ear harness and use it on either ear i have voice dialing on my phone and can use it with this also love it it can be a little tempermental some times but that means little when compared to the convenience,99,185
2851,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,works great easy to use good pricei would definitely suggest others to buy one,14,186

2854,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,the motorola h500 bluetooth headset looks pretty cool however it does not perform very well when phone reception is not at a maximum most of the time i can hear the people i talk to just fine but my friends tell me that i sound fuzzy when i talk despite it is shortcommings this headset is especially handy when you want to talk to someone while you are driving a standard transmission vehicle,69,189
2855,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,as good as if not better than the older moto bluetooth hss a little tricky to get to bond the first time with v551 phone dell axim and pc bluetooth but after the first time no problem no noticeable intereference when using excellent standby time a week for me sound volume and clarity excellent background noise is muted on the mic can not use it to listen to mp3s on the axim although also can not use it for skype on the axim either,83,190
2856,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,thisis good works good for me only complaint may be that whoever ur talking to may have a hard time hearing you sometimes other than that it is good,30,191
2857,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,sometimes it works sometimes it does not when it works it works great when it does not work about 10 of the time the older h500 i had before i lost it worked all the time this is the second newer one I have had and they do not work as well better than nothing i guess,53,192
2858,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,with this headset i can type or do housework even drive and keep my attention focused where it needs to be i do not know how i got along without this,30,193
2859,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this is my first bluetooth headset purchase i think this is a good entry level piece it works just fine functions as it should if you do not put the earpiece on just right then you may have some issues with clarity and volume both on your own side as well as your caller also it may flap a little if you do not get it to just just right when you put it on and that can be irritating for the price although this is the best deal and value i did not want to spend 100 on a gadget in case i did not like it this was a good choice now i know i made the right decision i liek my bluetooth but am not in love with it it works great in the car if allowed where you live it is perfect for long rides i can not stand it although when people use it in the stores while shopping,157,194
2860,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i received thisfrom tiger direct one of your sub sellers the piece came to me very hygienically dirty had ear and face oils on it very heavy actually disgusting where the blue tooth folds together very dirty the rubber piece that seals the ear from the outside was torn i called tiger direct and they had no issues with me returning it the girl gave me all the right info to do just that the unit worked well so i cleaned it with q-tips and glued the ear piece i really did not want to go through this mailing thing back and forth if you folks are going to sell used products you should have a quality control plan i am not happy and hope you guys will take care of this for the future,136,195
2861,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i recieved the exact product at the time i expected and was told it would arrive i am completely satisfied with my purchase,23,196
2862,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this is my first bluetooth headset and while I am impressed with the technology i was definitely not impressed with the design of this headset it does not secure very well to the ear which means that the headset flops around on the ear requiring so much re-adjustment during conversation that it negates the moniker handsfree,55,197
2863,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,easy to use not too bad looking would purchase again and recommend to others,15,198
2864,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,was a greatfor gifting and the person who has received it is pretty pleased wit it,17,199
2865,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i purchased this unit to use with my motorola v3 razr cell phone so that i could talk hands-free with people while i did things around the house it replaced my previous headset a motorola hs810 which i let get exposed to water whoops despite the higher price tag on the hs810 i feel this is a better headset it is very sturdy-I have dropped it on my hardwood floor and it still works just fine there is no unfolding boom mike with a hinge that wears out the controls are simple-hold down the call button to turn it on or off tap it to answer or hang up mating the device to my phone was simple and took seconds and i have not had it drop a call yet the microphone seems to work very well-I have never had anyone complain that they could not hear me and I have used the unit outside in windy conditions of course there are some negatives i wish the volume was louder-i have it turned up all the way and it still sounds a little faint the earpeice is tight and secure but it also pinches so long calls are going to be uncomfortable it is also not as eye-catching as some other bluetooth headsets if you want a workhorse headset that is dependble reliable and sturdy this is the unit for you it is a great value for the price,230,200
2866,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,no matter which manufacturer or what model it has become impossible to get a positive opinion on a bluetooth headset these days everybody just keeps whining about range read up on bluetooth technology will ya crackle low volume and disconnects I am glad i took the user reviews for the h500 with a grain of salt overcame my fear and got this headset for my nokia 6230i pairing was a cinch in over two weeks of use i have yet to experience a disconnect volume and clarity are pretty darn good range is excellent for bluetooth and battery life is amazing 4 days to a charge on average with fairly extensive use i have tested this headset while on foot outside and while driving my car no problemo my suggestion to the nitpickers complaining about these headsets state the make and model of your mobile phone in your reviews it could very well be that it is your mobile phone that is to blame for your poor experiences specifying the type of phone you use will enable potential buyers with the same phone to steer clear while the rest of us can go ahead and enjoy the wonders of 21st century technology by the way i am technologically savvy have had bluetooth headsets for over a year now and if you have not guessed it yet am very very happy with the motorola h500 highly recommended,233,201
2867,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like this headset because it is not big bulky complicated or ugly it has a volume up and down button and an on / off button just what i wanted nothing fancy but still looks nice easy to use and comfortable,39,202
2868,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this was my first bluetooth headset and what a mistake it does not fit close to my ear and i am constantly pushing it into my ear it feels like it will fall off at any time the biggest problem however is that it turns on with the slightest pressure i have recalled many people not knowing i have done so it is very frustrating when you are trying to make a call with the phone you think that the connection did not go through until you realize that the dumb headset has turned on in your purse i bought motorola because i expected it to be better than a less known brand it is very disappointing,116,203
2869,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i found that it will not connect easy and drops will not reconnect unless i turn phone off i had a hs820 my puppy eat it wow what a mistake with this one motorola very very sad always support there stuff,41,204
2870,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i purchased a family plan for my partner and i and we got these for headsets within 3 days we exchanged them 3 times each none of them worked even the verizon salesman could not make them work we were never able to dial out using voice commands and it kept turning itself off and on and in addition it was very hard to hear incoming calls and they constantly would fall off we dumped them and bought plantronics voyager 510 model g and they work fine do not waste your time and money on the h500 motorola what has up motorola,99,205
2871,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the headset itself works and dials as advertised i have never had a problem with the recognition by the phone or with people hearing me major downside to this headset if there was a zero option i would use it my problem is the constant turning on and off of the headset the slightest pressure turns the headset on or off or worse yet dials the last person you called over and over and over again my brother had to turn his phone off one night because over a dozen calls were made by my phone becasue the bluetooth headset redialed this was with the heaset sitting on the counter next to the phone without anything touching it because of that i have not used the headset in over a month and left it uncharged without a charge it has not called once in that time go figure that one do not get this headset,155,206
2872,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought thisrecently and it took longer to ship than expected overall i think this product works well it is not a high-end bluetooth device but it is not cheap either the volume works great for me i actually have it on a medium setting because the volume all the way up is far too loud the only complaint i have is if another person is on a bluetooth or speakerphone it sounds as if i am in a tunnel,80,207
2873,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i just received my bluetooth wireless earpiece yesterday and i am pleased to say that i really enjoy it it came sooner than what i expected i received exactly what was pictured online the bluetooth is very comfortable i have not had a problem with it falling out of my ear i would strongly reccommend this product to everybody since i just got the earpiece i can not say how long the talk time is on it thats why i only gave it 4 stars,83,208
2874,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,from all the previous reviews i am assuming that there might be some compatability issue between the headset and some phones or maybe some of these just come bad the one i recieved works great i can hear people just fine especially with the audio setting turned all the way up I have noticed that when i am in a loud room often people have a hard time hearding me but in the quiet of my car I have never had any complaints for me this headset has been worth it is weight in gold,92,209
2875,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,pros eye candy it is a cool looking headset cons audio level at it is highest level is low i had to push it against my ear to hear better it did not feel very secure on my ear slight head movements can make it move around / off the ear people i called sometimes complained of an echo,59,210
2876,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,my biggest problem is that the headset feels like it is falling off of my ear anytime i move I am afraid I shall lose it at any moment reception seems okay to me but sometimes people complain of an echo on the other end of the call which only occurs when i use the headset,54,211
2912,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,5.0,positive,i have owned two other bluetooth headsets and neither of them worked as good as this one it may be because i was using an lg phone and not an lg headset but in both cases they provided poor quality for both hearing others and for others being able to understand me this is the first one that i have ever had that performs flawlessly with my vx9900 the sound is loud and of excellent quality and the controls are simple to operate i always use it in the car and it is easy to put on and take off the light weight makes it feel like it is not even on after some period of time the other 2 bluetooth headsets i owned were floppy on my ear and even this one looks flimsy but it fits snug on my ear my only complaint is the charger is difficult to plug into the phone i am going to buy a 2nd one for my wife because she also has an lg and needs it when using her phone in the car,181,0
2913,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,2.0,negative,volume does indeed get pretty high and in-ear type bud does work well in a car however i had to keep bending the ear hook to try to get a comfortable position ultimately after just a few months the ear hook metal fatigued and snapped rendering the device useless for those of you who might say well you idiot you should not have bent it i would reply that a little bit of plastic coating over the thin coat hanger type wire would have made the problem moot I have used numerous other bluetooth earpieces over the last several years and this is the first time I have come across one that actually snapped if i am to be complete here i should also add that the charger is quite finicky to connect however in a positive development it did not in fact break,141,1
2914,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,5.0,positive,i am somewhat hard of hearing and i absolutely love this device this is the first bluetooth device i have ever had to turn down i have never had any problem with people hearing me too it is light easy to use and loud d,45,2
2915,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,1.0,negative,i bought this piece for the echo cancellation i did read the instructions i have not found it yet the people / listeners on the other end of the line continously complain about the echo they hear me as if i was in a tunnel while you can use it in both ears you will still have to completely plug it into your ear to keep it in place the hook around the ear is just to prevent it from falling out of your ear and onto the ground as it does not hold the apparatus in place for a clear sound / connection i have it paired with an lg-vx8300 and it does not maintain the connection i keep on dropping calls the sound is continously transferred to the phone itself leaving me driving down the road with an earpiece in one ear and the phone in the other the battery time is less than the promised two hours the pros small small small,160,3
2916,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,2.0,negative,physically this is an excellent design it is very light and very adjustable the sound quality from the ear piece is excellent i had several people tell me they could barely hear me although i have not had trouble using jabra and plantronics headsets with my current phone so I am inclined to think it is the mic in this one,59,4
2917,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,4.0,positive,contrary to the prior review i have found this to be a very good headset i have it paired with an lg cu500 phone and enjoy the features the first thing the prior reviewer needs to do is read the instructions as the button presses are not immediate responses holding the button for different amounts of time results in different actions which are accompanied by notifications through the in ear speaker the device is very small and compact with above average sound quality the in ear device loop is adjustable as the ear hook can be turned for use in the left or right ear and moved to the right or left for positioning it may just be my ear but it was not complicated at all and the only way it would fall out is if i had the hook positioned on the wrong side of the speaker also indicated in the instructions the only faults i really see are with the charging connection which is not clearly labeled as insert this side up so you have to fiddle with it to seat the charging connection overall it is one of the better devices i have used and i like it better than the jabra i had before as it is much easier to attach and weighs alot less,221,5
2918,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,1.0,negative,begin by trying to jam thisinto your ear so that it might have a chance of staying in it will not the ear loop which is not adjustable certainly does not fit my ear while you are trying there will be no way to avoid hitting the multi-function button so you will be incessantly pestered to please say a command unfortunately stay in my ear is not one of them neither are off no command shut up or anything else that might indicate oops i did not mean to say a command so she keeps pestering if you do manage to get the bud to stay in your ear for a second get ready to blow your ear out while dialing i have my keypad volume and the volume on the headset both as low as they can go but it still hurts my ears once the other end begins ringing the headset will soon be sliding out when you go to push it back in you will of course hit the mf button again hanging up your call complete waste of money,181,6
2919,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,5.0,positive,first regarding the shipper i have never recieved any thing so fast in all my life and the product was exactly what i had bought 2 years earlier at best buy for 7900 original packaging from lg nice deal now regarding the lg-730 i would not be buying another one if the first one had not worked well i lost the first one i am in the communications business and expect a lot from my equiepment and services after trying several other blue tooth devices i stayed with this one as it is simple comfortable and reliable so hope you have the same luck i have had,107,7
2920,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,3.0,neutral,this is the 4th bluetooth headset I have tried with my lg phone and it by far has the best reception it is also comfortable to wear the downside is that the button is not very user friendly I have had the device for a few weeks now and still have trouble turning that darn thing on and off as well as transferring calls the difference between all these operations is according to the manual whether you hold the button briefly for two seconds or for five seconds what has briefly there has no great blue / red lighting system on there to clearly indicate if the device is on off or charging,105,8
2921,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,1.0,negative,lg uses a proprietary connector for the charger i misplaced my charger and tried to replace it but i was not able to find a replacement charger with the correct connector i bought another headset instead motorola with a universal mini connector while the lg headset performed satisfactorily not perfectly by any means i would not recommend it because of the proprietary connector there are plenty of good headsets that use a universal connector allowing you to use many different chargers now i carry one plug-in and one car charger and use them for both my phone and headset anybody need an lg hbm 730 headset cheap charger not included [ footnote for some reason amazon has 3 separate listings for the lg hbm 730 ],125,9
2922,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,1.0,negative,this seemed like a pretty good headset at the start getting it connected was not too difficult the light weight / small size was awesome but soon i did run into some cons connection to the headset had a tendency to break on a regular basis usually after i had made a few calls and then received an incoming call so like another reviewer mentioned i would be driving down the road with the headset in one ear and my phone on the other the headset falls out often i have a bigger then usual ear i guess but still other headsets are adjustable in one way or another this one is not after a month of only periodic use the sound quality has become horrible lg has been less then helpful with this issue either my unit became damaged or maybe it was defective from day one either way it is destined for the junk gadget pile now,155,10
2923,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,4.0,positive,i like the size and light weight of this headset it has a thin wire around the ear so sunglasses can fit comfortably with it once i figured out how to use the power on and push button features i liked the convenience of using it also helps to read the instructions the volume and microphone also work very well,60,11
2924,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,4.0,positive,my last blue tooth headset defeated it is own purpose i had to do everything on the phone and just use it as an ear / mouth piece with the upcoming law change i needed something truly hands free this one sounds great people can hear me the voice commands are accurate 90 of the time and the price is right do not over spend,61,12
2925,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,5.0,positive,i have been using this headset for about a month now and could not be happier great sound louder than i could ever need and people that i am talking to say that i am as well easy to use simple design minimal buttons comfortable i can leave it in my ear for hours on the road it is so light and really stays put bluetooth parnership is a breeze i have a cingular 8125 and i have not had a problem yet the only thing i could complain about is that the charger is a unique plug design so i have yet another cord to travel with,108,13
2926,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,3.0,neutral,the product did not come in packaging it was a gift and quite embarrasing to give a gift that way,20,14
2927,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NIAS7O,4.0,positive,i saw a sales person in a verizon store wearing it i asked her how she liked it and she raved i was using a motorola bluetooth piece and it was ok not enough volume a bit heavy and it always felt like it would fall off if i moved my head to fast well this is none of those things i actual keep my volume below full while driving it is so light and comfortable i forget it is on it is so clear people tell me they thought i was on a landline phone overall it is great the best one i have used to date i use mine with a motokrzr the phone works great in it is own regard but extremely well with this device a few things that are not great it is hard to plug the charger in with a little practice it gets easier i wish the notification light was not at the same place you push to turn it on and change functions you almost completely cover it when pressing the button small things when it has crystal clear sound and so comfortable to wear,187,15
2977,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,programmed in a foreign language and could not figure out how to make it work in english,17,0
2978,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,got this phone to replace one i have on att phone came in as t-mobile but that did not matter should still work did alright for about a month then boom the entire phone started going haywire ring tones backgrounds volume everything started going crazy had to pull out an old phone for the wife so she could receive calls and messages this is the first chance i have had to make a statement about the phone,75,1
2979,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,great phone even in a market where 2 years makes the last model seem laughable i have yet to find a phone that has such a good feel to it not too small to use comfortably yet still nice and thin i only wish that the ringer could be turned up a little louder,54,2
2980,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,this is the worst product i ever recevied product do not work made a report and ever email or even try to assist me sorry bad product,27,3
2981,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,the razr we purchased is so perfect i will never buy a non-unlocked phone again the phone is brand new and at the low price i can not believe we did not do this before the company did send a dead-battery originally but they made up for it by overnighting a replacement,50,4
2982,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,this phone is fantastic it takes care of all my needs phoning scheduling keeping track of people and data and more while traveling around the world it is sturdy and does not damage easily or initiate functions by accident easy to use and fun to use i love it and this is the second razr v3 that I have owned my only complaint is that it creates a completely different entry in the phone book for different phone numbers for the same contact my old razr v3 t kept them all in the same line,90,5
2983,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,this was purchased for my husband who does not want anything that is difficult to operate he likes it good clarity of sound and easy to use,25,6
2984,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with the purchase i made i received the phone brand new from the seller and it was shipped to me within the time frame mentioned i was advised by a friend to view the site for unlocked phones and was quite surprised at the variety of model phones,52,7
2985,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,first of all i received an email telling me that the original silver one i ordered was not available would i accept a grey one instead these things happen so i said no problem the phone that arrived was not working the screen inside and out was dead i was given a return address and had to ship the thing back myself i can understand if i just did not want the phone but to eat the return shipping fees to return an obviously defectiveis something the seller needs to cover i feel completely used and will never do business with this company again this is the reason that i normally only deal with amazon shipping the gear as they will do the right thing and cover return shipping for defective merchandise too bad the same can not be said for this seller,143,8
2986,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,i am very happy with this phone it does everything i need it to do it is a good size and easy to use,24,9
2987,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,perfect i wanted an extra phone for my trips out of the country it worked perfectly and still does could not be happier,22,10
2988,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,this is our second razr v3 so we are already familiar with the features and i was happy to find the same model still available we occassionaly travel outside the us and this phone has worked great elsewhere in the world we got tired of jockeying sim cards so will leave one set for the us and the other will be our travel phone when we need it the phone arrived promptly but i orded black and got silver the box and instruction book were labled for a black phone and the cd had obviously been used envelope wrinkled cd scratched so i think the box may have been cheery-picked over time the phone itself seemed to be unused so we will keep it and do something ourselves to distinguish it from our other silver razr,135,11
2989,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,the phone worked fine in india upon arrival we went to alltel booth where they installed a prepaid chip you need passport picture a copy of your passport local address and phone number i could call anywhere instantly,38,12
2990,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,have used razrs in past with good luck but this one broke within 6 months and amazon would not replace it so i would not buy another phone from them again,31,13
2991,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,i have been a razr user for the past 3 years the new phone i received worked just as well as my previous one it was unlocked for sure it has worked with my sim card as soon as i put it in it has been the same case for my father in india as well after i gifted it to him he is quite happy with the phones functionality he was noticing that the batteries need charging every two to three days which apprently is unlike his previous phone a nokia i think that seems to be the only concern,101,14
2992,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,i bought this phone because it looks like a nice phone i had big problems with the phone it did not work properly the phone would not hold a charge-the battery would die after making two phone calls unfortunately i had to return the phone and get my money back,50,15
2993,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,I have had this phone for almost a year and really did like it in the beginning the sound was excellent the button placement and size made dialing and texting fairly easy i was very happy with it then it started to fall apart the connections from the screen to the base started to go wonky the screen just randomly goes black and seems to like to stay that way if i squeeze and push the screen in just the right way i can get the picture to return but that seems to be working less and less most of the time i am unable to see who is calling what a text message says and i can not hardly use it to text to anyone the rest of the phone is in great condition but what good is all that when you can not even see it,146,16
2994,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,i purchased this from another store but it worked perfectly i could even talk across the room and it was comfortable wearing it for hours it could be worn on either ears and the hook could be molded to fit your ears curvature the only problem was that the hook broke overtime because of usage the headset still works,59,0
2995,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,this headset is great it is small and easy to use will purchase again if ever needed i have small ears and this headset actually fits very comfortably and does not feel like it is going to fall out all of the time,42,1
2996,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,this is not a bad little headset i picked it up cheap for use with my ps3 it pairs up easily and the sound quality is as good as any other headset I have used if i had to do it over again although i doubt i would buy this model for gaming there has no mute function which is not a must have but it is very convenient for coughing or answering a phone call the biggest downside is the aaaa battery aaaas pricey little buggers especially if you buy them in a retail store amazon sells a 6 pack for 6 that is the cheapest I have seen if you are looking for a ps3 headset you might want to have a look at the soon to be released socom headset it looks to be ideal for gaming as it should be,136,2
2997,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,1.0,negative,this head set paired quite easy with my motorola v3 but the aaaa battery is very very hard to find and expensive as i talked about 30 - 40 minutes with my cellular phone everyday i do not think i could afford to buy aaaa battery so frequently i am going to return it,52,3
2998,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,this is an excellent value works well with sufficient volume and never needs a charger paired with my samsung phone easily and the menu recognition works fine,26,4
2999,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,it is a decent product but i rather have a bluetooth with a charger instead of having to continually replace the battery,22,5
3000,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,1.0,negative,the one i received from unlockedcellphonekings came is a ziplock baggie and had a 3 month warranty this was at the very best a refurbished product,26,6
3001,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,1.0,negative,when i bought this headset a couple years ago it was the cheapest one on the shelf i assumed all bluetooth headsets were the same i should have read the fine print before i bought it the entire problem with this headset is that it uses an aaaa battery you read that right not triple-a quadruple-a these batteries are hard to find and expensive cheapest ones on amazon are still nearly 1 apiece good luck finding them if you run out while you are on the road oh and good luck finding rechargeable ones not to mention a charger that will work with them and you will have to feed them to this headset it will still work as the battery begins to drain but i found call quality dropped significantly after just a couple hours of use you will be able to make calls but there has no guarantee the people on the other end will be able to understand them but really the entire battery issue makes this an absolutely worthless product if you use a headset a lot you would spend less money buying the most expensive headset you can find than if you get this one,197,7
3002,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,2.0,negative,not overly impressed with thispros cheap easy to connect to phone uses a regular 4a battery instead of a charger which i tend to misplace plus you do not hav to wait for it to charge if it is dead just pop in a new battery cons sound quality is low there is static on the line it is a bit heavy and awkward on the ear verdict wish i had just spent a bit more and gotten a nicer one,81,8
3003,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,this wireless bluetooth is exceptional for the cost the battery dies fast and i am having a difficult time finding this size battery aaaa in regular stores,25,9
3004,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,i needed a new cell phone and live in california and it is hands free here I am not big into needing an almighty phone and have been a virgin pre-paid user for some time now this headset will be left in my car to be used only when i am driving so it is 10 price was perfect for me i have had it for a month now and the battery is doing fine i did buy some spares and keep them in the glove box it took sometime to figure out how to turn it off but figured out that my cell tells me when i turn it off and on sound is good not great it fits my ear fine,120,10
3005,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,2.0,negative,spend the extra cash and buy a better one battery does not last for more than a couple calls,18,11
3006,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,it is great except it takes aaaa battery can not find much of those i wish it was rechargeble but other than that it is great,23,12
3007,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,cheap and easy to pair was hoping that it was able to stream music over it but it can not be done,21,13
3008,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,inexpensive sound pickup good reception good light fit a little flimsy i do not really like things growing out of my ear but it comes in handy to roam,28,14
3179,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,i like the way this works but it is a bit bulky and hard to open i think thinner leather a smaller clip and an easier flap would improve things but it is still good,33,0
3180,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,the case seems well made but the little things are either not thought through or not manufactured to spec the fit overall is reasonably snug but since the bezel on the note is so thin there is precious little non-screen real estate on the sides and the case could have benefited from more stiffness in that area as it is it just bulges to the left and right the bottom strip also bulges in the middle the microphone on the note is a small hole on the bottom of the casing the case has a round piece punched out for it but it is not quite centered on the hole you have to wiggle the phone and/or stretch the leather from time to time to keep it open on the other hand the cutout around the usb / charger connector is huge at least three times it is width there is no i repeat no way to connect the earpiece or headphones to the top jack when the flap is closed apparently designers did not expect note owners to listen to music or the radio while the phone is in their pocket or to have a long conversation hands-free nothing that 5 minutes with an x-acto will not fix of course also this concerns only the vendor not the product prime members should not put their trust in the two-day shipping i ordered theon friday night received a shipping estimate for wednesday and it finally arrived on thursday six days can not count as two under any definition of the term,257,1
3181,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,does everything it said it would do nice leather case good protection for the phone case is black leather there are pockets for credit cards the case is constructed such that it allows all buttons and functions accessible,38,2
3182,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,to be perfectly fair this is technically a very good case offering high quality construction with plenty of functionality i actually found it nearly perfect on a recent trip to washington that being said i own the ceramic white galaxy note and this case actually stains the back battery cover right in the middle there is a pale dark stain from the interior of the case I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to my electronics and this is driving me nuts i actually had to order a new battery door from amazon again great case beware if you own the white note,105,3
3183,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,part of my normal routine in the morning is to get in my car and drive to work if you have a similar routine you will need to know that the maleon the back of the case that slides into the female groove on the belt clip pulled out of the back of the case there is a metal bushing that thethreads into the bushing pulled out as well i only had this case for 2 weeks when it happened i would not consider getting into my car to be abuse so i am hopeful that boxwave recognizes this to be a design flaw it may be that for the samsung note there needs to be more reinforcement i reported this to manufacturer over a week ago but still no response i have four more stars to apply to this review should they decide to do the right thing,152,4
3184,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,this case is a perfect fit for the galaxy note it is extremely attractive functional and protective I have already dropped it and it withstood the test excellent product i like the vertical flap because it comes with a removable clip the clip is handy but is easily removed so the case fits nicely in your pocket excellent product,58,5
3185,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,would be nice if the discription tells that it is not real leather i only bought this case by thinking that it is actual leather and the price not worthet at all hope it will be halpful for someone,35,6
3186,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,i bought this case twice at different times the first one had a problem as a snap in the back was cracked only a month of use i then ordered the second one in hopes that the first one had been defective however the second one only lasted a few weeks as the case did not fit my phone completely it looked so weird as the case appeared too small for the phone finally i had to take it off from the phone for a better look this case is overpriced with the design and bad quality of this case the listing price for this case is not worth it,110,7
3187,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,i found the case to be very well constructed and it looks great the case is well padded but the phone in the case is still very thin and close fitting the only two things i would change is first have an opening for the headphones to plug into and second the opening for the volume on the left side will never line up properly and it always is a bother but i never give up so the simple fix was i removed my phone pushed the top of the leather opening up and inward putting a small amount of super glue in the crease and it is out of the way it does not effect the looks at all and it is easy to use the volume rocker button i found all of the other openings lined up perfectly please remember that with all leather cases you must seat the phone properly in the case this could be corrected at the factory but i do love the case i ordered this from amazoncom by next day delivery and as always i received it the next afternoon this is why i use amazoncom so often they always deliver as they promise and everything is well packed and in perfect condition,210,8
3188,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,this is a great case for my samsung note unfortunately i got an extended battery so now it does not fit but if i ever go back to a normal battery i have this in my drawer ready to go,39,9
3189,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,i understand that this case was really designed for the international version of the note but it really is I shall fitting for the most part not a great deal of thought seemed to have gone into things like the audio jack and mic openings i could have lived with all that but what i can not abide is the fact that it broke within a month what good is genuine leather if the plastic components are cheap the piece that screws into the case and holds the belt clip broke rendering it useless to me would have gotten more use out of the 30 by using it as tp,108,10
3190,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,initially looks excellent after five weeks clip started getting loose after eleven weeks clips got broken while getting into car needs to have a better clip for 30 i would not buy similar product unless has a decent return policy,42,11
3191,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,great price for a great product shields my phone from the elements and love the old school belt clip it even has a spot to store memory great job,29,12
3192,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,i purchased thisbased on the excellent review i read on amazon i used it for maybe a week and i noticed that the clip would not keep it in place especially when in the car and getting out it dropped a couple of times inside of the car but when i got out of the car one day and dropped on the asphalt i realized that it does not fully protect the phone from the bottom the other thing with it is a described by others that you can not use a corded earphone to listen to music or to talk becuase the way the flap on the case is it will not allow you you would have to keep the flap open then it would not serve it is purpose,127,13
3193,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,unfortunately i can not use this case because i can not use my phones volume rocker whenever I am on a call it is very annoying that i have to take the phone completely out of the case whenever i need to make or receive a call this is not to say that there has no opening in the case for the volume rocker in fact there is an opening for the volume rocker the problem is that the opening is not big enough and/or it is not properly aligned so whenever i try to use the volume rocker it simply does not work because the case is always in the way very annoying,105,14
3194,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,you have to be kidding me thisis at best a 2 to 3 star product it is not high grade in any way but really when you have a product as large as the note and are thinking about attaching it to your belt you should be shot anyway fashion disaster,52,15
3195,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,this is a great case in theory but the design is just not there it does not fit the note in a snug manner so you are constantly having to move it around to gain access to the power and volume buttons additionally the four buttons on the front face home backare partially covered by the case making it difficult to use would not have been a big deal but when i wrote customer service i received absolutely no response at all whatsoever fortunately i contacted amazon directly and they gave me 100 of my money back and allowed me to return the case i still have not heard anything at all directly from this vendor although,118,16
3196,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i bought the lg vu to replace my sony w810i and returned it the phone is very attractive although i expected the quality of the materials to be better the touch screen works well and the landscape qwerty keyboard is great for text messages call quality is good and the speakerphone is loud five problems although 1 the screen is barely visable in the sun 2 the camera is better than most phones at 2mp and auto focus but there is no flash and the sonys 2mp camera took better pictures 3 I am on a mac and i do not want an iphone because of the monthly service plan cost but the lg vu does not sync with my mac and the sony did 4 it does not work as well with my acuras handsfreelink in car bluetooth it does not show the battery life or signal strength 5 the contacts does not provide a space for birthdays or addresses if these issues do not matter to you then I am sure you will like the phone i however was trying to upgrade phones and a touch screen does not a great phone make ps sorry i can not comment on battery life or be more in depth but i only had the phone for a day before i returned it i purchased an unlocked nokia n82 a few weeks later and that phone is far superior although the price is high,237,0
3197,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i had this phone for about a week to evaluate the tv service the reception was good for me both at home and at the office the phone itself is great but i was constantly wiping the screen it is a fingerprint magnet as for the tv service i was promised espn but what i got was a mobile version of espn no sportscenter in the morning no video highlights just scores whoopee no mlb just college baseball and lacross for the most part however if you like reruns of the tonight show letterman daily show and more then this phone is for you if you want live sports programming forget about it for now anyway mediaflo promises football this fall but i will sit this one out for a while until they deliver,131,1
3198,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i just switched from verizon to at t i live in new york city and the service is horrible always need to stand near a window did not have this issue with verizon the phone is great but there are a few kinks biggest issue is the touch sensor scrollbars not as easy to use as the iphone camera does not have a flash and pictures come out blurry,63,2
3199,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,this phone is awesome and has great haptic touch get this over the cu915 because after upgrading you really notice a difference,22,3
3200,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,this is a great phone imoho it will place calls run java apps play music take pics and low q vids send and receive text and mms messages email has a calender with which i keep appointments i owned a so-called smartphone prior to this one and had the upgraded battery and guess what the huge battery for my moto q did not last more than two days anyway large batteries are not worth the trade-off you give for space and extra weight my vu lasts for two to four days and it is over two years in service with the original battery one last bit of advice for anything with a touch-screen buy and use those clear screen protectors when they start looking like he shall trash them and stick a new one on if you compare this phone to an iphone the comparison is much like comparing a top of the line bmw seven series to a top of the line ford they both do everything you need but one does so much more and is priced accordingly,178,4
3201,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,i have this phone for almost 2 years now and the screen sensitivity is very poor the battery life is poor it does not have plug for typical headset to listen your music you have to use their provided earpiece it always drop the call,45,5
3202,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,i bought this phone in january 2009 as i was interested in a touch screen phone the lg vu was sleek and slim and web browing was great i had the data plan up until a few months ago when at t decided to change there pricing plan for unlimited usage was 15 then 10 then change it back to 15 unless you had another user using the plan to qualify for the 10 rate what a rip i had some issues with calibration but this was easily taken care of typing on the keyboard was a hit and miss sometimes not a big texter mostly used the keyboard when accessing the internet dialing numbers was also cumbersome at times the phone worked like a charm up until the end of last month when the touch screen started acting up would either freeze or jump from screen to screen or jump back to the main screen i did take out the battery and try a few different methods before taking to at t they tried for 20 minutes no luck only told calibration is off and that i should either get a go phone or put my sim into another phone would i buy another lg phone maybe just not another touch screen eyeballing the se c905a as a replacement when renewal comes up here is the kicker for me i missed geting the insurance by less than a day i never had a problem with at t phones up till now i will be getting insurance for my next phone although i now have a nokia 2320 a basic phone but it makes calls and this will get me through,278,6
3203,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,my vu was working great up until a few days ago when the touch screen went out i noticed some black specks inside the outerof the screen it is only a year and a half old and i take care of it so i am unhappy that it has failed me i can now only call numbers in my most recent call log using the call button these companies make products to only last so long before we have to replace them very upsetting,85,7
3204,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,i have had this phone for about 6 - 7 months it was great and i had no problems untill 2 weeks ago it began randomly turning off the screen would just go black i am good about keeping my phone plugged in untill it is compleatly charged but i am having trouble with the battery meter switching from full to low very frequently currently the phone only works when it is plugged in i am lucky if it turns on when it is not plugged in i have talked to two other people with the same phone and they are having the same / similar problems i do not reccomend this cell phone it is terrible,113,8
3205,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,i can relate to all the negative reviews my 1 complaint is that the touchpad has a feature which locks it within about 2 - 3 seconds of inactivity it does this so that your ear does not accidentally press the buttons as noted in john earnharts review forget trying to use your number pad while making a call if you made a call and need to press numbers to go through a menu system it is so frustrating as for texting both of my kids hate using this phone for it it is very slow compared to hard keys both wish they still had their old razr phones did i mention that the camera function works fine too bad my digital camera can not accept phone calls,123,9
3206,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,briefly you can get on the internet and get your email reception is ok but this is not a high quality phone the touch screen is temperamental with a lot of unintended results and missed inputs the bluetooth works well although and battery life is ok overall i would not buy another one,53,10
3207,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,i like this phone it has a nice feel there is a learning curve with the touch screen querty keyboard but it is a quick learn the menus are well laid out and easy to navigate the ringer could be louder but the call quality is very nice and very loud as well i had two of these phones and i had to send them both back no matter how long i left these on the charger they would never indicate that the battery was fully charged i could leave it on the charger for 2 days and it would never say charge complete so i sent them back and ordered the motorola karma all in all if you can get a phone without that problem with the charging circuit it is a nice phone i wish lg would get their act together in the quality control department since i have encountered this i have found that this is a fairly frequent happening and has been going on almost since the phone was first introduced amazoncoms service was great in taking care of the defective phones,186,11
3208,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,yes this phone has some excellent features that would be why i selected it about 10 months ago unfortunately my contract / warranty leaves me stuck with this lemon i am yet again using a disposable phone while i wait for them to replace my lg again I am not hard on phones i do not swim with them i do not play handball with it i do not play extreme sports with it in my pocket it is usually either in the recharging station sitting on my desk or in the cell phone pocket of my bag it just stops working out of the clear blue every lg vu cu920 i get loses the touch screen capability within weeks or months i can answer calls because that is a mechanical function but otherwise it becomes a paper weight the instant i become eligible for a different phone i will be changing brands and getting a phone without a touch screen nice concept execution not so much,165,12
3209,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,the touch screen on this phone decided to break at exactly one year and one month after i bought it so lucky me the warranty is only for one year i took the phone to the at t device support center and they were surprised that the screen lasted this long they say that they see a lot of this phone at the center for this particular problem i have insurance on the phone and when i called to get it replaced i was told that they no longer carry this phone and they offered me the samsung solstice instead even they are done with this phone i think there is a problem with the touch screen sensor because i touch the screen and it registers on the other side of the screen or I am not touching the screen at all and the screen starts clicking things itself even although i am not touching anything with touch screens once the screen goes the phone is unusable my next phone will have normal buttons you never hear about buttons malfunctioning,178,13
3210,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i was excited to upgrade my phone i upgraded to the vu back in april the phone was to my liking then but after about 3 months my touch screen started acting finicky i baby my cell phones and this one was no different so i had no clue what happened i tried searching online but i could not find anything in fluorescent light you can see the oil-like colors of the touch screen and it looks like it seeped out of the interior and now when i use the phone I shall click one place it will register in another it is very frustrating to deal with knowing that at t will not help me out with it either the touchscreen interface is nothing like that of the iphone which is to be expected but this touchscreen could be so much better the menus are okay not the greatest camera quality is average video quality is not that great i was not satisfied with this phone i wish i would have gotten something different because now that i am looking for a new phone there are numerous out there that are better than the vu,189,14
3211,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,i bought this phone in april this year i really wanted a touch screen phone but that turned out to be the really bad feature of the phone it has really good reception and calls are clear but texting is a pain with this phone it seems that you need to carry a stylus with you to be able to txt and move around the menus it has good features but the touch screen problem makes it very difficult and frustrating to use if you want to send txt quickly this is not the phone for you in addition i recently added an unlimited data plan that is when i decided that i need to get rid of the phone battery life is very poor when using the browser and it will run out on you in minutes if you use youtube scrolling in a web page is almost impossible again the difficulty with the touch screen now that i have unlimited internet i decided to get rid of the phone and buy an iphone even if it costs me full price the important thing is to get rid of this phone as soon as possible two stars only because it is a good phone with good camera but that is it,208,15
3212,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,i recently bought a lg vu phone unlocked when it arrived here in barbados i put my sim card in and it tell me invalid now i have to pay 75bbd or 35usd to have it unlocked I am very disgusted about this because on this website the phone is being sold as unlocked to be used anywhere,57,16
3213,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,the phone is attractive feature rich touch screen sensitive but if you drive a lot the vocal commands are cumbersom to use camera not so good screen lock unlock must constantly be pressed during a phone call all in all so so must be a better product on the market i would not buy it again,58,17
3214,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i agree with the others about the responsiveness of the touch screen and the volume very good i use an old-school plantronics headset with it and it only drops the signal on occasion that being said here are a few caveats that are not really dealbreakers but they can be irritating after a while 1 if you dial voice mail right after a missed call the voice mail number replaces that number on the call list it looks like you can call them right back by using the touch screen but in fact it dials voice mail instead if the number is not elsewhere on your phone this can be inconvenient while driving for example 2 if you want to return to the mute screen after dialing into a conference call you have to backspace thru the numbers you keyed in 3 there is not a conference call feature to add someone to the conversation if someone else calls you on the other line 4 you can not set the alarm while the phone is silent if you do not want to be awakened by phone calls the vu is still a nice low-cost alternative to the iphone if you do not need all the bells and whistles but my next touch screen phone will have at least one of these issues remedied,219,18
3215,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,lg vu cu920 phone at t i have been a very satisfied t-mobile customer for 5 years before switching to at t what a mistake the only reasons why i switched to at t are rollover minutes and corporate discount which i have not seen on the phone 1 battery life is very short even after turning off 3 g mode battery life is far from what i want it to be 2 charging takes a long time 3 sometimes there has a lag time between touches 4 key pad is not as accurate as blackberrys i guess you get what you pay for 5 bad design on the location of the memory card and bad design on the charge / headphone connector 6 reception sucks and occasionally you will get no service available at places where you normally get reception this could be on at t network but then this phone comes with at t services so on at t bad customer service bad reception watch your bill tried to bill me something that i did not subscribe also tried to charge me something that i have cancelled one week before the free trial period ended citing that the change did not show up on their system until a week after the trial ended corporate discount it is been four months and i still do not see it customer rep just kept on telling me that it will show up on the next bill the buttom line i can not wait for at t contract to end and go back to t-mobile and a phone that is not made by lg,258,19
3216,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,hi i bought this phone from amazon 9 months back and paid 50 bucks i choose this because of touch screen which does not required data plan this is my first touch screen phone and worked nice for 3months and then touch screen stopped responding i got annoyed and called amazon customer service and they responded by replacing the phone but got latter got letter saying they can not do that i called them multiple times and told to contact att and did the same but att said since i have no insurance they can not do anything i started using my old razr v3 which still works and now waiting for next upgrade from att,113,20
3217,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i previously had the lg shine i really liked the phone but my 2 year old broke it it did not break my heart because i really wanted a phone with a qwerty keyboard for texting and i was eligible for upgrade since i was very pleased with the shine i decided to stick with lg and go for the vu i am very displeased with the camera on this phone everything is blurry unless you are able to be perfectly still and in perfect lighting i have adjusted settings nothing seems to help if someone can offer tips it would be appreciated the shine had an excellent camera that even had flash having a toddler i love this feature it assures i do not miss any special moments just because i do not have my camera with me the touch screen works fine and reception is good which are the most important things in a phone battery life is a little less than the shine but the screen is bigger brighter and the keyboard vibrates i would assume that would take more energy i am also very disapointed with the ringtone capability on this phone ringtones that i was able to use before on the shine are too large to be used as ringtones on the vu why would lg do this overall it is a phone it is good for talking and texting if you are not interested in the camera or having a wide variety of ringtones this is a really good phone it just seems that instead of improving on what they already had right lg took aback with the features on this phone can not quite understand that this will probably be my last lg phone,286,21
3218,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,i had this phone since sept08 to march09 initially i liked this phone very much since it had att live tv but that is the only selling point of this phone the touchscreen is resistive and most of the time one has to tap more than one time to use the feature and being resistive screen it has overall dark contrast coming to battery life it is very very bad i mean very very bad att tv finishes battery so fast that one can not imagine if one is using headsets to watch att tv then one can not charge the phone since both charger and headset uses proprietary port of lg music is of worst quality one can only use lg headset since it has proprietary port and the music quality is very bad and sound is way too low no wifi is also a big time disappointment one has to depend on att medianet to use internet on the phone plus no gps also dampens the use of this phone i paid 17999 before 50 rebate with contract extension and i feel totally disappointed ebay-ed this phone for 160 and bought a new nokia n85 which is 1000 times better than this touchscreen phone positive reviews you might have already read it and if you have never experienced touchscreen before you might like it too but my suggestion is to go to a store and try it and try other touchscreen phones too before ordering it online,245,22
3219,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,i purchased the lg vu last week and received it a day later but i only paid for two-day shipping not one day so that was pretty sweet the phone itself is pretty to look at and while light does not feel like a toy the touchscreen has vibration feedback which i love and the calibration is flawless my only problem with the phone is when I am scrolling through my contact list the scroll function gets overzealous often shooting me far past my desired selection other than that the touch screen is near perfect the camera functionality is great even without the flash and the audio clarity is amazing with either a bluetooth headset or just the phone,116,23
3220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,1 batt sucks i need to charge it everyday and i only make less than 20 min phone call and check my hotmail maybe 3 times 2 dropped call i was supposed to have a phone interview and when the interviewer called went directly to voice mail guy was cool about it and left me a voice mail with his number so i can call them back btw i made sure i had 5 bars with att so it def problem with this phone 3 stupid lock screen when talking stupid menu you can not change shortcuts go for the samsung instead they both free from att any way,108,24
3221,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,i bought two of these phones one for myself and one for my husband when we signed up with at t a few months ago we had studied phones and decided these were the ones we wanted overall it is a good phone but not great i like the touchscreen and have not had any problems with it like some others have had the size is good as it is not too big or too small the icons are nice and easy to access however i wish that i could somehow customize the icons get rid of some and move others another con would be that if you are in sunlight the screen is almost impossible to see and where i live it is sunny all the time so it can be a pain there is a brightness setting on the phone but it does not help when in the sun i also wish that the case was not plastic it comes across as cheap and has the ability to scratch easily i definitely recommend getting a screen protector and a case to protect all aspects of the phone the sound is good except that when i am speaking it sounds like i am talking into a wall it does not seem that it is going through the phone i am still trying to get used to that saying that although it does have good sound coming through the other end of the phone and nobody has complained about hearing me overall both my husband and myself love our phones and have gotten used to them for the most part i would recommend this phone to anyone just know that there are some flaws that come along with it,287,25
3222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,the phone is very nice for the price with only a few cons pros nice qwerty keyboard sturdy although i can not know for sure because i have not dropped it but otherwise sturdy good sound quality for calls music videos ect excellent camera cons touch screen can be a little difficult to scroll hard to see if it is bright outside like most phones the battery life could be longer almost all 3 g phones are this way,75,26
3223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,my husband had this phone and it is a piece of junk the touch screen is really cool and he liked that if you want to text it creates a keyboard on the screen now for the problems for awhile after we got it the phone would die anytime it was off the charger at t sent a replacement but by the time it got here the old one was back to working really not sure what was wrong initially so that problem was resolved but after that anyone who called my husband could not hear a word he said just the loudest static / windy sound in the world he is not rough on his phone he really does not even use it much so that caused our second replacement by at t other major issue that we did not like is that the memory card which you purchase separately goes under the battery which means every time you take the card out or put it in the phone dies we had this phone for 9 months and had to call warranty twice and each time it took up to a week to get them to send the replacement definitely not worth the hassle i have an lg shine that i got at the same time and it is been perfect and was cheaper the third time it broke was 8 months after we got it it just stopped turning on completely regardless of if it was plugged into the charger or not we gave up and got a 20 nokia phone that has been a million times better do not waste your time or money,266,27
3224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,i bought this phone a few days ago and so far have been very happy with it the phone feels light but sturdy it looks pretty good but i would suggest getting some sort of case or invisible shield as haphazardly throwing it in a purse or pocket with other items can because unwanted scratches despite qualms I have heard about the battery life i have not noticed anything below average the touchscreen is quite responsive but does have a bit of a learning curve after a few days you will be a pro although the qwerty keyboard is surprisingly easy to use considering it is size if you want to be able to play with cool games or apps this phone is surprisingly modable I had suggest anyone who gets this phone heads over to [ ] there you will find lots of guides and how tos on making your phone perfect one of the things i was surprised about was the difference in speed i upgraded to this phone from a razr v3 and did not realize how much of a speed boost 3 g gives even smss go through faster if you are looking for a nice non iphone touchscreen then look no further this phones for you,201,28
3225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,i really like this phone i commute and the picture quality when watching tv is really good the screen vibrates slightly when you touch it so you know you connected with your target there was not the learning curve i expected with a touch screen the web browser is very good and you can switch from portrait to landscape and from qwerty to standard keypad at the touch of a button the mobile email feature lacks gmail for some reason although gmail is easily accessed through the web browser i have paired and uploaded pictures and files easily with this device and my bluetooth enabled pc although it does not sync with outlook calendar or gmail calendar if that is an issue for you the only unfavorable comment i have is that when i first got the phone it would shutoff randomly upon searching the web i found a thread that pinned this problem down to some sd cards used in the phone i had purchased a 2 g kingston minisd card once i removed it the problem ceased therefor it seems that there is an incompatability problem with some brands of microsds if anyone can recommend a minisd card that they know works i would be appreciative as i would hate to buy another only to find out it causes the same issue,222,29
3226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i really wanted to get a touch screen phone and finally ended up getting lg vu the only feature that is awesome in this phone is touch screen and it is responsive may be 80 percent of the time pros touch screen excellent display decent camera decent sound cons worst body material my phone is 25 days old and now looks like 1 year old that loses all shiny coating buy a good case and a screen protector music quality is only good with the earphones poor signal reception average battery life day to day and half when you are talking on phone the keypad gets locked automatically after 2 seconds very annoying if you need to access menu at that time takes some time to open pictures or music memory card is located behind the battery you can not see how much battery life is left in terms of somehow lot of dust gathers near speaker and when you play music the dust pops out hope this review is useful,171,30
3227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,i got to say i was a little hesitant with this phone because it does not look that good on the internet but having owned this the vu for a few weeks now it definitely grows on you i love this phone now the touch screen is very responsive and att tv fuction works great my only grip would be that browsing the internet is a little tough the scroll bar and the text can be frustrating at times but that just takes a little getting used to a must buy for those who want a touch sreen but can not afford the iphone,101,31
3228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,after reading tons of user reviews on amazoncom and other websites i still decided to take a chance and purchase this phone in addressing some of the other reviews heres my 2 cents why do people keep comparing this phone to an i-phone if you had an i-phone why would you downgrade to an lg vu I have never owned an i-phone but i assume it is the cats meow of cell phones so do not put this phone down because it is not the same as an i-phone this phone may not be as expensive as an i-phone but at least you will not be forced to purchase a more expensive data plan with at t unlimited data plans for i-phones is 20 more than unlimited data plan for the lg vu yes the battery life could be better but if you are not constantly websurfing playing games emailing and talking on the phone for hours and hours then the battery life is not bad so even although the phone comes with a charger i purchased a universal charger so that i can charge my phone through my pc and my vehicle now i can charge up my phone anywhere and anytime overall this is a fun phone that keeps me entertained if you get this phone you will need a data cable because aparently lg did not think a multimedia phone should have included a data cable this is my only con with this phone i wish cell phone companies would stop nickel-and-diming customers also get a memory card and a silicon case the phone shows smudges and fingerprints very easily that is all for now i hope my review helps someone out,276,32
3229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,the lg vu is an awful phone especially if you want to use a memory card when you go to access your ringtones or pictures graphics and more on your memory card it takes like 3 - 4 minutes for them toi returned the phone to the at t store,48,33
3230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,i have owned this baby for 2 weeks now and am very satisfied with the lg it was free for me with a new contract so i can not complain about the pricing i do agree that battery life diminishes after a full day of being on but as another reviewer suggested the 3 g can be turned off see end of review for the instructions i go on the internet surf write my emails with ease text with ease the touch qwerty keyboard option makes it quicker to do so the buttons are normal size but if you do have ginormous fingers you will encounter annoyances typing the wrong key as you would with any other touchscreen the display has great colors video / tv shows great and fluidly the camera is ok not the best but it is not advertised as a digital cam so no big deal i do not appreciate the comparison to the iphone because duhh it is not an iphone you can do the same things as you would on the iphone except not spend all your on the iphone plan or iphone price for those that think they need to be cool by having an iphone go buy one and stop whining for the rest that are contemplating getting this phone it is a no brainer and it is free heres how to turn off 3 g on the vu if you do not plan on using it 1 dial 277634 on the keypad to access the test menu 2 select modem settings 3 select network mode 4 select network mode again 5 select what bands you wish to be active select 2 g if you want to make the 3 g searching stop this is what reduces battery life 6 press the clear / back button until you return to the main screen,296,34
3231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,i bought this phone and used it exclusively for over a month i normally keep phones for 2 years the lg vu cu920 is a great phone i just sold it on craigslist and plan to buy something else why would i do that if i like the phone well one reason is i think it would eventually kill me while trying to use it in the car it requires very little brain power to dial a normal cell phone i much prefer to have a keypad at all times too many times was i frustrated trying to click a numeric key but there was no keypad i just missed a good old fashioned phone with numeric keys to push when i need them that was basically it the phone is really neat the touchscreen worked great really easy to view the display but i just wanted a phone to talk on and this phone made that too complicated there were a few other oddities where the screen would scroll too much or too little that i just could not adjust to i still give it 4 stars,187,35
3232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,i have had this phone for two weeks and i love it i am impressed with the call quality and i have not experienced any of the background noise that some reviewers have mentioned battery life has not been an issue for me either although i may not use my phone as often as others the internet interface is servicable but i do not really use my phone for that purpose the touch screen is responsive and the camera is adequate for a cell phone again not my primary concern i love the qwerty keyboard as i am a horrible texter without it all in all considering i paid a penny for it with my new service plan i could not be happier,122,36
3233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,i have the lg vu i got it after my samsung sgh-a737 broke it was awesome for the 1st day i had it as days go by i kind of wish i had not got it and have gotten the pantech matrix pros nice looking phone quality phone calls loud speaker camera is great has tv 3 g network light weight land scape keyboard cons touch screen is not very responsive need to push hard on the screen the phone is slow it needs toyour files like pictures and music and I have never had a phone that had to do that normally a phone would just show the pictures as soon as you clicked on the file can not edit the quick start menu and the quick start menu has only 4 items you can have another quick start menu that has 8 items but none of them are what i really need on the screen and can not be edited only moved around can not see the screen in the sun only 4 gb of external memory can be added no where as good as my samsung sgh-a737,185,37
3234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,great touchscreen phone some notes the screen is not heat-sensored so you can use a stylus or some other object to type on it unlike the iphone when texting it offers a standard phone-like display or you can switch to the qwerty keyboard good for your own personal preference you definitely need a case protector for it the jelly ones work great because it scratches easily voice command is a complete pain to use because you have to search through 4 screens to find the button to record your voice and by that point it defeats the purpose,101,38
3235,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,bought this for my wife she loves it this is my third phone from amazon,15,39

3237,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,hey people so you probably this is a reveiw about how great the lg vu is right wrong this little piece was written to let everyone out there know how easy it was for me to add a review on amazon although i never purchased this lg phone and in fact just found out about it i just wanted to show consumers out there how easily a manufacter can get on this website and pretend to love anthey made or are selling just like that i am able to type up this review never had purchased a phone and claim it is one thing or another so that you the customer can be persuaded to spend your hard earned dollars purchasing that product this just goes to let everyone out there know be careful before you buy anything online just because a bunch of reviews say that a product is good should not in turn because you to skip out and go forward in purchasing that product to be fore warned is to be fore armed take it from a customer that knows,185,41
3238,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,if you are looking for a pda first phone this is not for you otherwise this is a realy nice phone the touch screen is very responsive the battery life is ok you will probably have to charge it about every other day the qwerty touch keyboard is nice but it does not give you that option for every text entry it takes good pictures and video and has the options of a smartphone calander memo to do list ect the only thing i do not like is that it does not come with sync software or a cable and that the phone does have to be on to access the options or for the alarms to go off i have to turn on the phone in the morning and turn it off at night the battery last about 2 to 3 days depending on how much you use it,146,42
3239,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,design is ok but quality is so so i bought two cu920 at the same time one often shuts down automatically once i plug in a 2 gb microsd card that card is good for sure the replacement for this phone works well but has defects on the paint another phone shuts down automatically after 3 months use but works well without the microsd again the microsd works great on the other cu920 even re-calibrated the precision and consistent sensitivity of the touch screen is far from iphone and itouch dial someone in the contact list is fine but if you dial through the pad for some codes and phone numbers you are very likely to mistype or double type digits today i found one pin of connector of the earphone was bent the tiny design of the connector is prone to damage and when you has the connector on it is really hard to adjust the volume since the connector blocks half the side button for volume adjustment this is a phone but those annoying things make the major function downgraded,180,43
3240,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,exchanging this garbage as soon as i can pros form factor lightweight great pocketable size i prefer the plastic of this phone to the iphone since it cuts down on weight vibrate confirmation love this feature lcd quality / size seems better than average cons will just list the biggest ones since there are so many call quality is awful hiss in background on every call 3 g is terrible faster on other 3 g phones i have tried even when i get all bars this could be related to the fact that the phone itself is slow hangs up quite a bit with internet connections mail touch screen is terrible impossible to scroll using the screen you have to use the bars on the side otherwise you will most likely select instead of scroll needs some major haptics work here where the f is the headphones jack obviously not standard 50 points there good lord battery life if you even view a couple of cnn videos completely shot so to use the phone to watch anything you better be plugged in somewhere phone locks while you are calling this is insanely annoying esp when at t for instance prompts you to press 4 for customer service wow who designed that can not use the great qwerty keyboard to input contacts what the fuck i actually like the qwerty keyboard on the vu but you rarely get to use it going back today but for what do not know i have heard bad things about incite as well so maybe samsung or iphone,247,44
3241,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,if you use your cell a lot this is not the phone for you i just got my vu and am not happy with it yes it is a good looking phone but that is not going to matter because if you even think about using this phone without the ugly protectors you are mistaken you can not see the screen in daylight so forget about using outside or in your car it is not user friendly and full of spams from at t my first bill will be 16100 and I have got the 3900 plan plus the 1500 for the web which they make you agree to that is a lot more than i expected free phone yeah right they should pay you to use it i should have stayed with t-mobil would have gotten a phone and would have avoided the aggrevation and the additional costs and still receive great service i can not see how this phone will last out the 2 year period just think of anything with touchscreen the contacts just wear out mine is going back,175,45

3244,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,my wife gave me the lg vu 920 the phone looks nice the touch screen works well for me and call quality is very good and the speakerphone is great the best feature is when pressing one button the time and date flash on screen in large letters unlike other phones i used before what i do not like about the phone is that it takes many steps to get where you want for example speed dial several steps switching between two calls also it takes 3 steps the signal works in some areas in my house while another phone works in all areas all in all i like using it,108,48
3245,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,besides the battery time being a weak point the scroll down mechanism for your call list is poorly designed you can not get to the bottom of your list without hitting the options button at the bottom of the page thereby not permitting access to those numbers this is definitely a pooly designed mechanism lg needs to go back to the drawing board guess i have to wait two years before i can get a new phone,76,49
3246,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,i have wanted a touch screen since the moment i saw the first commercial about the iphone i have been able to play with an iphone just a little but there is only 1 feature that iphone has that lg vu does not scrolling pictures by touch the iphone flips through pictures as you run your finger across the screen where the lg vu does not but other than that there is nothing that the iphone can do that is better the the vu love it,85,50

3248,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,at first when i looked at the phone i thought this would be a good one i am disappointed to find out that it is not so great the touch screen takes a lot of pressure to press on a button on the screen texting can get annoying because the letters do not get accurately pushed because of the touch screens sensitivity i can only put the phone on vibrate or ringtone not both when it is on either i can not hear or feel it when someone calls and it is in my pocket I am hoping to switch to verizon because I am not happy with at ts service if you want a touch screen phone the best way to go is the apple iphone apple does it best,125,52
3249,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,i chose the lg vu instead of the apple iphone i wanted something smaller more satisfying this excellent little phone caught my eye and was just what i wanted the touch screen is very receptive more so then any competitors htc fuze google phone lg voyager incite samsung instinct and more and even has tactile feedback vibration when you touch it even although most camera phones have a two mega pixel or more camera this phone is set apart by the extremein the pictures the camera on this is better than my sony digital camera the only things that i wish it had were a standard 35 mm headphone jack and customizable menus this phone is a great buy,120,53
3250,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,the alarm does not work when the phone is off or phone in silience mode how can you sleep well when you set up a alarm but afraid someone maybe call in to ruin your sleep my previous samsung all have the alarm working when phone is off iphone is better than this also although iphone can not alarm when it is off it can alarm with sound even it is in silience mode,74,54
3251,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,I have had the cu920 for a little over a week now and am very happy reception and call quality are crystal clear the touchscreen seemed a little off at first but works and is responsive the qwerty keyboard is a great option i like the fact that the phone can be easily modded and there are quite a few applications available at [ ] i would have given this phone 5 stars but there are definate problems with the battery life and charge meter the phones meter will show a full charge and 1 phone call will drop it to low battery there does not seem to be an in between i did get 2 - 3 days on a full charge with regular phone usage new phones use a li-ion battery that do not have memory cells and can be charged anytime without fully draining the battery i simply charge the phone everynight to avoid the issues with draining the battery this phone does not have the 3d axis tilt found in the newer touch screen phones,173,55
3252,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,just got this little lg and here are my thoughts very clear voice calls great speaker and the people on the other end can not tell I am on the speaker while i am driving the touch screen is really bright and pictures show great getting used to the touch screen but the feedback feature is really handy for me reception so far has been great only one lost call in an area that i know is a deadspot did not think I had care for the tv feature but it is very cool and great for killing time at airports and while visiting my mom who does not have a tv in the spare rooms the screen is really sharp and the picture really shows well even if a bit small like i said so far so good the only negatives are the world time does not adjust automatically when i reach a foreign country and as a result i can not use the phone as my alarm clock abroad that is a very useful feature on a lot of phones i also can not use my recordings from my music downloads or voice recordings as my ringtones and last but not least is that there is no flash on the camera but i knew that before i got the phone overall i am very satisfied with it as a phone which is why i need it all the extra stuff to me is just that extra this may keep me as an at t customer,245,56

3254,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,great phone if you want to get the feel like a iphone battery life sucks shutting off 3 g just about doubles the battery life you can follow the instruction from other reviews the qwerty keyboard is fantastic but if you have big hand it will be hard to type but works just like the iphone internet and tv works great but it sucks up the battery life the touch screen vibrate which you can turn it off because it is annoying the phone does charge fast then other phones i owned if you click on the unlock it will let you know how much it is charge or when it is fully charge you can not talk on the phone while it is charging,123,58

3256,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i have been reading the reviews on this lg vu cu920 and was getting reading to buy the reviews were not that bad i have changed my mind because of the storage capacity if they can build ipods with 16 gb of memory or very cheap new 16 gb mp3 and camera touch screen players for under a 100 bucks v-touch 8 gb mp3 / mp4 28 touchscreen 69 or topguide 16 gb mp4 / mp3 fm / voice w/30 touchscreen 99 why purchase a phone that has very little memory i have had many phones since moble phones have come out back in the early 90s spending 7000 a year on cell phones was a normal thing for me versus 800 now i am getting a little tired of breaking in new phones so in the last year i had to buy in a hurry and got a cheap 20 go phone and love it no frills but it does the job when they come out with a phone with 16 - 32 gb memory plus expansion with the same i can carry all of my photos-music-files and more with me if you would see the amount of computers cameras hard drives and all the electronics i own it would mind boggle you i have spent well over 25000 since 1994 in computers and related electronics i want to down size and have everything compact in one little unit to make it very simple so i can have the time to do a little fishing and still show another fisherman some of the photos i have of the big fish i used to catch and anything else i need to access i now like to play the waiting game when the right one comes along i will jump on it,288,60

3259,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,i bought this phone as an at t contract extension 3 months ago this phone was in lot of demand that time and amazon initially said it will be reach me in 3 weeks and they kept their word good bad and ugly light and thin perfect fits your pocket it does feel plastic although easily gets scratched touch screen with haptic feedback great feature qwerty keyboard is great for text messages music player sucks no equalizer option battery life is almost non-existent like one of the reviews if you see one bar of battery left it means that the phone will start beeping low battery in 2 mins and shutdown is t-5 minutes the screen is dull and unreadable in sunlight if you do not care about the technicalities of the phone and want something fancy this is your phone definitely attracts attention in crowd,150,63

3267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,it is very easy to use lightweight great sound quality the only reason i do not give it 5 stars is that the shortcut menu is not programmable wish it had the ability to put what you wanted on it like iphone does instead of presets that you can only move around but not add or delete terrific quick access to email / internet battery life is really good considering i have a browser on all the time my son has the mobile tv feature activated i do not and he loves it crisp clear and lots of channels so far it is the best phone i have ever owned,103,71

3274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,pros light weight good internet speed affordable than iphone cons does not let us customize shortcuts on the screen can not see the caller number / name while in sun in the name for phone number it let us only 18 characaters it does not distinguish mobile home work fax and more by different phone icons except that you have to name them although you can not rename the first one i have been using this phone since a week and i noticed that if i talk for just atleast 5min it gets heated in the back beside the camera and i could feel the heat to my ear while talking did any one face such heat,108,78
3275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,totally a good deal as opposed to buying from at t store just saw the 915 is now 1 penny i would have waited to get that one since i am not using the mobile tv i paid 4999 for the 920 still a good deal in my mind plus you get ear bud very cool touch screen just feels nice to use one weird thing that no one else seems to mention in the reviews they ask for your social security number to verify your account and status of upgrade i felt wary to enter that on the internet but everything seems to be ok 11/11/08 update it is not very friendly to use when you can not focus your entire attention to the phone especially when driving with a phone with buttons you can feel around and navigate contacts with ease with this phone you have to be looking at it in order to make the proper selection and make sure you are pressing the right button it is also not very friendly when you have to switch calls for call waiting I have also had it call my voicemail randomly if I have got a message or if I am intentionally dialing for my messages it dials again and says I am sorry someone is already accessing this mailbox then i have to end that call switch to my original and my message is halfway done playing weird also annoying when you have to dial numbers in a voice menu the screen locks quickly so that your cheek does not hit a wrong button but then you have to press the unlock button every time to navigate the menu still overall a nice phone and now that it is down to 1 penny how can you go wrong,292,79

3279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,i bought this phone because i wanted a touch screen and did not want to have to pay an arm and leg for one i would have to say that overall I am pretty happy with my decision and the phone is perfect for someone who does not care for all the fancy extra software I am not much into emailing I aming ect but texting i do love it i have not had any problems with the phone it has a very loud ringer battery life so-so the only thing that irritates me is that i have to change all of my ringtones to mp3 format in order to use them on the phone and also can not change text ringer to personal ringer overall really satisfied,121,83
3280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,there has a lot i could write but I shall simply list the pros and cons pros touchscreen works extremely well super lightweight plastic screen trust me this is a plus if you drop your phone the iphone has a glass screen therefore breaks easily you can use a stylus although i recommend a screen protector if you do great reception volume is loud mobile tv works well cons no 35 mm headphone jack i can not even begin to explain how annoying that is for a so-called media phone no flash on the camera at t fills the phone with tons of applications and other stuff that you can not delete battery life is pretty awful the phone does not come with much extra no usb cord no real internal memory and no headphone adapter the web browser definitely needs to be improved especially once you zoom all in all i was tempted to return this phone but since i have a job where my phone goes through a lot of abuse the simple fact that this phone is insurable unlike the iphone was enough for me,182,84
3281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,my primary requirement when researching my next phone was outstanding voice quality and i am really glad to say that the lg vu really meets that need callers on the other end have told me that they can not tell i am on a cell phone and on my end their voice is clear crisp and natural-sounding since i spent a lot of time on the road i want calls with clients and co-workers to sound professional and this phone gets me there the other features are sure fun but not the reason for my purchase for email / calendar / contacts and more i use my blackberry but for voice calls and yes the tv functionality is amazing this is my new go-to device highly recommended,121,85

3283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i was very excited to receive the classy gold jawbone because it would not show with my blond hair i had previously purchased a different one but i was told i sounded like i was talking under water that one fit great it had a small oval shaped ear bud which is probably better for women the jawbone ii has a terrible fit it kept falling off my ear and every time i tried to adjust it while i was talking i would accidentally turn it off it fell off so many times in the two days i had it i actually lost it that was a big waste of money it should have a smaller better shaped bud actually made for women linda c,124,1
3284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i was really really excited about this product my friends have had great success with the original jawbone and the technology is the top of the line it arrived and was beautiful really like jewelery but it just does not fit I am fairly petite and have small ears it almost falls out of my ear and does not stay close to my head if it is not in contact with your cheek the other person can not hear you which is a shame because the sound i hear is crystal clear a big dissapointment,90,2
3285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i wasted an entire evening trying to get this stupid thing to stay on / in none of the 3 earbuds and several ear loops did anything close to keeping the device on and you can forget hoping that it will stay on your ear and touching your face like the instructions say it must do for you to be heard not only does it move away from your face with any talking or movement however slight but it falls out / off if you dare turn your head or make any sort of movement even slow careful movement it is good looking but utterly useless,101,3
3286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,I have tried a bunch in the ear and out this one is very uncomfortable even although they give you three different inserts and ear bands it has to stay touching your skin around the jaw to work properly and it just does not stay put all of a sudden people say hey i can not understand you any longer when it is working i am told it sounds very tinny and on my end the incoming sound is pretty good but i kept getting beeps series of three single ascending or descending several variations that the factory had no explanation for their people are very pleasant but do not seem very well versed on the product they are quick to tell you how wonderful it is although i tried the manual but it is really useless sorry i was really looking forward to this product after all the hype I shall stay with the motorola h710 it is wear all day comfortable and more important it works,162,4
3287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have tried and own many bluetooth products over the past two years only one did i truly like and it stopped working not a month after i purchased it this beautiful works as advertised it fits and feels well on and in the ear you do truly get what you pay for,53,5
3288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i am very angry that i got a broken one it is no response when i connect the power usb s,20,6
3289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i really should not even give this a one star not working at all i had few bluetooth devices before and never ever had any problems with them defectivefor sure,35,7
3290,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i could never get this to feel comfortable it would not stay in place and people always asked me if i was driving when using it which to me says that it was not picking up the sound clearly when it finally got lost i was relieved,45,8
3291,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,have wanted to get a noise canceling ear piece for some time the price was very good so i bought this unit i has clear sound good battery life and is easy to operate,34,9
3292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,the price it was good ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok okok okok ok ok,20,10
3293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,not great not bad i have a beard and it does not touch my cheek so the mic does not work well with me also it does not fit my ear that well basically i have to readjust ever 30 seconds or so would not recommend but cheap enough,45,11
3294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,this is my third try purchasing a jawbone 2 gold for my wife arrived at christmas doa shipped it back replacement was doa got refund ordered from another amazon supplier in retail package and this one is doa contacted jawbone really disappointed quit selling jawbone,45,12
3295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,it works pretty well I have heard complaints from people about the quality coming through their end and i guess that is because the noiseassassin piece does not quite touch my jaw great sound on my end although and it holds a charge pretty well too comfortable to wear as well,49,13
3296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,phone died on me by the time i got a new one and got around to trying to make it work it was too late to return the thing never would talk to my phone and when i tried it with the next phone i got after that one it was super crackly and unusable connection when it worked at all fail,62,14
3297,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,grr the earhook is a thin piece of plastic that pops off the main console and unless your ear canal magically fits the ear bud such that it will not fall out then you will need this plastic piece which really did not help that much sound quality was average i really do not see what the jawbone hype is all about dog eventually chewed it oh well,64,15
3298,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,ordered three jawbone aliph ii bluetooth headsets from buygetgo none of them worked called jawbone who said they were defective and to return them advised me not to purchase from buygetgo just passing this along,35,16
3299,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i have ordered the aliph jawbone ii bluetooth from amazon several times one for me one for my lady friend and now another to replace the one i ran over in the parking lot this last order contained the same bluetooth except this particular seller apparently dismantled the packaging so as to send me only the bluetooth itself and exactly one earloop luckily it fits and one cushion for the ear itself again luckily it also fits i did not expect that the seller would be so cheesy as to remove all the other loops and cushions which i received with my two previous orders which had come in their original packaging most times a discountedis discounted because it is slightly out of date but contains all the items supplied by the manufacturer in it is original packaging i certainly did not expect this order to come like this the picturedis not accurate since the gold loop was removed presumably to be sold separately to someone else it is advertised to be sold in the retail packaging and this clearly was not i like the jawbone but i feel like i was ripped off by this seller aliph jawbone ii bluetooth headset with noiseassassin gold [ retail packaging ],215,17
3300,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,very stylish i get compliments and offers for it often wonderful accessory to my diva lifestyle bought some extra ear loops since i broke one so all in all great value while looking gooood,35,18
3301,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,great sellerarrived on time and was is good condition i had a jaw bone before purchasing this one i think this one was actually an older model it did not last as long as my old one did i liked the gold,45,19
3302,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,my only gripe about the jawbone is that if I am not careful when i push it back into my ear when I am using it when it feels like it may come out i accidently disconnect my call there is no exact button but the whole top half of the exterior of it is the button other then that it works great no problems,63,20
3303,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,i am able to hear very well using this earpiece and it is more comfortable than other bluetooths my only complaint is that the buttons are very sensitive and take some getting used to a few times i was adjusting it in my ear and i accidentally hung up on people i am hesitant to use when talking to clients until i become more used to it,66,21
3304,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,great sound quality better than phone quality very inexpensive compared to other quality bts buying a 2nd one for my husband,22,22
3305,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i received my gold jawbone ii on monday it is wednesday it is still not charged defective from jon bargains is no bargain buyer beware i should have purchased from at t,30,23
3306,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,lost my old one and could not wait to get this one received it quickly and i use it all the time when i am in the car,27,24
3307,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have been through several blue tooths and everyone complains they can not understand me no one complains with this one i conduct business and call students parents without worrying they will not understand what i am saying,35,25
3308,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,it is only ok because it does not have the features i love on my motorola h500 which are easy to connect long battery and standby life goes into standby by itself to prolong battery life 1 click turns it back on synced it is cheap it uses a mini usb charger big for me as you do not have to she shall out a bunch of is you lose the charger as you most likely have a mini usb cable for something else i resent the quantity of different chargers i have especially when i travel and have to pack them all why can not they all be mini usb tip use silver permanent maker to label all of your power cords,124,26
3309,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i ordered this after losing another jawbone it does not work or keep a charge i want to return it it just does not work and lasts for about 2 hours before it needs to be charged again it is very disappointing,40,27
3310,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,after trying several name brand bluetooth devices my best friend asked me to get her one that worked as good as the ones i used so i got her this one and now i can hear her clearly during almost any situation yes heavy direct wind is still a problem but music and most extraneous noise is filtered out so that all i hear is her voice when making a phone call these are really amazing and i would not suggest any other bluetooth devices than the jawbone brand,88,28
3311,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i bought this headset because i needed one for in the car i am happy with it so far but there are a few issues that bug me first the headset takes some effort to position correctly so as to obtain the help of the noiseassassin technology it took me a few tries to get it right second the ear piece is not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time because it is speaker presses on the outside of the ear canal rather than nestling inside it like most earbuds however the advantage to this design is that you do not feel deaf in one ear while driving because some sound can still make it to your ear also on the plus side the bluetooth connects quickly and effortlessly and has not failed once the buttons take some practice to get used to but work well once you understand them all around this is a sound earpiece,158,29
3312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i love this product i bought it for my wife she is happy with it no issue connecting to iphone and clear voice i am thinking of buying for myself,30,30
3313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,I have had a motorola clip-on [ visor ] but it always was losing the bluetooth pairing it is a pain to repair the jawbone is so simple to pair with my iphone 4 i could not believe it it is a pleasure to use my only concern is to get it to fit around my ear well although i have not tried too much yet to adjust it the simple touch to turn on is great bill,72,31
3314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i like my new bluetooth the noise reduction is good the sound is clear the additional attachments allow for a comfortable fit,22,32
3315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,I am satisfied with the unit bought it to use with my watchphone while biking or driving sits nicely in my ear xl size ear bud from the package worked best it does have the volume control press noiseassasin button to cycle through volumes quick guide explicitly mentions it dsp was sufficient enough to talk in a busy street not sure it will work ok on a construction site like in their advertisement the downsides poor wind blocking abilities important for outdoor / biking users however i do not know any devices that address this issue and proprietary connector very convenient although,100,33
3316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i have had this for about a week now when not is use i fold the earhook down guess what the ear hook is a thin piece of plastic that just snapped off inside the unit not even a piece of metal covered by plastic this is a thin piece of plastic that is brittle it did not bend it simply snapped off,63,34
3317,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,with multiple earbuds and loops it was easy to find a comfortable fit occasionally fails to pair with my phone good battery life has yet to fail during the day with charging every 2 - 3 evenings,35,35
3318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,bought this for noise cancellation work in factory with alot of noise which it does not filter out can hear well but does not do the job for me little better than blue ant but not much,36,36
3319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i have one jawbone and wanted another so bought this new one i had to return it because the over the ear clip is large and only comes in one size it is not adjustable wow an ear piece that only fits 1 size person great everything else but if you can not actually use it what good is it I am going to get another blueant q2 which i have on now great sound and great fit,76,37
3320,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i purchased this aliph jawbone ii headset for myself and later for a friend i usually like the sound quality however sometimes i have had to turn the volume up to hear some people it is light and comfortable on my ear i have been able to wear it for hours without problems i do not have to charge it very often it holds a charge i really like the design of the charging cord as well even although it is just a usb connector the wall plug folds down to save space the delicacy of this headset has it is drawbacks I have been careful not to put it in my pocket but it broke after getting loose and then knocked around in my purse not a good place for delicate items overall i would recommend it but advise keeping it safe,140,38
3321,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i read some pretty bad reviews about this earpiece before i purchased i have to say it is a great product the noise assassin works great and the earpiece connects everytime without fail contrary to other reviews the battery life is great i can go all week without needing to recharge it,52,39
3322,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,the headset worked well for the first two-three months then increasingly it started to drop out there is a silence and i realize that i have to pick up the handset to continue the conversation so the phone call was not dropped just the transmission to the device it seems like the battery may be the problem after it has turned off once or twice in a row it just will not start again until i have charged it again,79,40
3323,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have only used a jawbone since i saw a review about it years ago i will not use any other bluetooth aliph does a great job updating the jawbone with technology and the colors too,35,41
3324,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,very sensitive to touch trying to adjust it in your ear often results in ending call very frustrating not most comfortable fit,22,42
3325,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i purchased the jawbone ii and the sound is great but as with the other reviews i have a devil of a time keeping it in my ear and when i adjust it i cut off the call i will keep trying the different ear pieces and hooks but so far it works great as long as i keep it in my ear,62,43
3326,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,it is a bit scratchy at times but for what i need it for in the car it does the job ok,22,44
3327,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,excellent sound / needs a better earpiece other jawbone models have them it needs the type with the loop to hold it in this type of earpiece needs to stay close to the canal to be heard and the looped earpiece that comes with the other models have them i have had other jawbone units the buttons on this one react better,60,45
3328,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i already have been using a jawbone and i love them bought this one for my wife because her other one did not work very well,25,46
3329,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i purchased this smaller jawbone when my first one broke i was concerened that it was so much smaller i am glad they include different sizes of the ear piece 3 to be exact and an additional ear loop the sound is awesome it is very crisp and audible my husband drives over the road therefore he is in different areas of the country i just wish a case was included with the product i give it a thumbs up,79,47
3330,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i read quite a few reviews here that talked about the difficulty of the ear pieces accidental disconnection due to the type of touch-buttons this headset has as well as the problem of seeing the light when activated and syncing up with cell phones most reviews discussed ways to tackle these problems and i ordered this headset I am quite happy with my headset from the variety of ear pieces provided to make the fit more comfortable to the sound quality of this device excellent on both ends of the conversation i had no difficulty in pairing it with my cell it took a few times to get used to the light touch that is needed for the device when answering calls or adjusting the noiseassassin however it is no different than the headset device i use at work friends were able to spot the small light on the piece when i turned it toward them when i was on a call and i prefer not to have a glaring light out of the corner of my eyes i highly recommend this device over a few others that I have tried in recent years for the voice and sound quality alone it is also light weight easy to use and attractive to boot take some time to familiarize yourself on how deft of touch you need in answering calls and adjusting the sound otherwise I have not had any problems with this device,237,48
3331,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i read in a lower review that it did not fit right i have a tiny ear and i just put the smaller piece on and it fit like a glove i love this thing i personally sold many of these working in a wireless store for well over a big one so for the price it is an absolute steal i would consider this the best bluetooth available at this time,71,49
3332,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,beautiful looking product but i do not like that the noise control button and the volume adjusting were confusing to me i wish it actually had a marking or some indication of where to press to get results,37,50
3333,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i bought this product because of the extensive review and several people i know has this jawbone it is suppose to reduce noise around you and the purpose of it is handsfree and convenience this product is not convenient i have a hard time hearing and so does the individual on the other end of the line alot of times I am told it sounds like I am under water i do not know why i have this problem but i am very unsatisfied,81,51
3334,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this bluetooth is comfortable to wear and easy to use the only draw back is that there is no volume control on the bluetooth other than that i love it delivery time was outstanding arrived in about two days,39,52
3335,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i read the reviews before choosing the product the reception is great but i do recommend the rubber piece that fits in the ear instead of the hook around the ear which makes for very poor fit the little rubber piece with a piece to fit in the crease of the ear is fabulous it does not come out overall great buy joyce atlanta,64,53
3336,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,pretty to look at and when it actually stays in your ear it does cancel excess noise however the key is staying in your ear and touching your jawbone forget it i liked the product but could not stand the fall out not working buttons in wrong places when you tried to make the thing stay in your ear great advertisement poor engineering buy something else that works,68,54
3337,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,there seems a problem with the battery the talk and stanby time become less and less it is annoying to charge the headset frequentyly,23,55
3338,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,I have read a lot of reviews before buying but i have to repeat almost everything i say,17,56
3339,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,not that impressed really i thought that this would be a top of the line product then my wife picked up a nokia for half the price it is more comfortable and the sound is great this aliph unit is uncomfortable and just does not fit well sound is fine but no better than my wifes cheaper unit given the chance i would give it back and trade to another model in a second,74,57
3340,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,after 9 months of using the jawboneii i have to give it a middling score overall the earbuds that came with it were completely worthless and i have now broken the last earloop so I am back to using my motorola h710 i had forgotten what a good fit it was no more worrying that when i take it off or put it on I shall bend the earloop too far and break it the only thing the jawbone has in it is favor is the noise-cancelling besides inadvertantly ending calls when the thing threatens to drop off my ear i would also get a strange noise sometimes when attempting to answer a call kind of like the noise you hear when tightening guitar strings too bad they did such a terrible job in the fitting department i even purcased the eargels on amazon after breaking the first loop or two trying to get it to fit better,155,58
3341,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,hurt my ear when i wanted to press the power on and off no switch which at first would seem like a plus had to talk louder than other bluetooth headsets i own plastic piece broke after about one month this is supposed to be the nice bluetooth,48,59
3342,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,I am not all that happy with the jawbone ii turning it on and off is funky you press it down and wait 2 seconds but you can not really tell if you have held it down long enough or not they could improve it by adding a tiny button or switch or something also the connection to the cell phone randomly turns on and off this is very frustrating with that said the sound quality is the best I have found so far so i continue through the other issues for it,89,60
3343,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,does a great job if properly positioned the cover on the ear loop keeps sliding off and is impossible to slide back on,23,61
3344,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i had the previous model of jawbone and loved it but i lost it and decided to go with this model because my sister loved hers I am hoping i find the old one because this one does not work as well for me i had to send the first one back because it would not hold a charge I have tried all of the ear pieces but none placed jawbone properly in my ear so i can hear well people i talk to say they can not hear because my voice breaks up when i push the location of the noise abatement it turns off the unit and i lose my call because it is too loose in my ear i have to hold the little microphone against my face so people can hear me if i have to bend over it comes loose and sometimes fall off I am disappointed in a product that started out good sometimes it is best to leave things as they are my next one will be a different brand no relection on the vender a good experience and i would use the vendor again,185,62
3345,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i had the original jawbone and hoped this would be an improvement but it was a great disappointment i have small ears so maybe the fit is the issue but people complain that they can not hear me when i use this jawbone my voice fades in and out as although i am talking through a tunnel i have tried all the different attachments to get a better fit but nothing helps i rarely use it because it is so bad,80,63
3346,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have used this with my iphone 3 g it interfaced easy and works every time if you read and follow the instructions anything more than a whisper and i get people telling me i need to stop shouting i use it mostly in my car with the window down and the stereo playing it works as good as it looks,60,64
3347,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,compare with the voyager 510 this headset is the bane of my existence i use my headset often so i thought this headset would improve my life so i decided to upgrade and change from voyager 510 to the jawbone ii but it was a big mistake what good is the headset if people can hear you loud and clear but you can not hear them back,66,65
3348,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this is a fabulous product and the almost half of the retail cost at any outside stores love it linda beach co sprgs co,23,66
3349,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,there are 2 short comings to this product first the sound level is too low for the first ring or entry and there is no way to set it secondly the ear bud that comes with it hurts after a short while and it is not very comfortable other than these 2 things it works very well,56,67
3350,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this is a great hands free device as long as it remains in contact with my cheek the connection is clear it fits snugly and securely,26,68
3351,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i have two identical jawbones and neither have batteries that last any more than four hours,16,69
3352,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,my husband had wanted a jawbone for his birthday we were going on a trip out of the country and had been searching the internet for the best price i could fine until i found it on amazoncom the lowest price was 87 plus 15 for shipping when i found it on amazon thought to good to be true total with shipping around 57 customer service advised was inorginal package i ordered and was here in a few days the only this was the package the box was crumbled up i think it was due to the poor packing hardly anything around thebut works great and husband loves it,108,70
3353,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,this jawbone 2 is not what it seems to be i mean it works good when you can make it stay on your ear it keeps falling of and there is no way to fix that,36,71
3354,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,i own the original jawbone and love it it really does cancel the background noise the jawbone ii promised the same experience in a smaller form factor it is smaller but not better in fact i find that the sound quality is poor for the wearer nobody has complained on the other end as to what they hear the ear piece was redesigned i do not like the fit at all it does not stay put as well as the original design I am going back to my larger jawbone i which without a doubt is the best headset I have ever owned,99,72
3355,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this thing works great my only complaint is battery life it only lasts 2 days under moderate usage the noise cancellation is worth it although great fit and never get complaints when talking to people while driving with the windows down anymore,42,73
3356,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i purchased two of the jawbone ii noise assassin devices about two months ago worked great until two weeks ago both sets one for my wife will not hold a charge for more than 5 hours tried to contact jawbone using thier customer help website no response i usually do not have bad luck when shopping on the web these jawbones are crap spent way too much money for bad devices no response from amazon either i hope I am the only one that got burned on this product now my wife gives me that told you so look ahhhhhhh,96,74
3357,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,this is my 4th bluetooth headset over a few years use i was really excited about it because several of my friends loved theirs when the unit is against your face the noise canceling is very impressive i left myself a voicemail while driving through a heavy construction area and it was amazing however several people including myself have noticed that it is better to turn off noise canceling unless you are in a noisy environment or it seems to because it to cut out i did not find the fit to my ear to be particularly great so i hold the unit to my face when noise canceling is turned on the big problem for me is that the range on this unit is really a lot worse than my other headsets i also wanted to use it with skype and other computer based communications and on a new mac and a few different newer pcs the static was bad so i got a callpod drone this really helped but the range is still bad so i might as well be using a corded headset the killer for me was that the battery was weak and would not hold a charge so i have to return the unit i like the looks and technology and bad batteries just happen sometimes but since I am returning the unit i am going to look for better range and voice quality,239,75
3358,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i love the voice quality both ends but am having a difficult time getting it to stay in my ear great product just needs my patience to get it to fit better,32,76
3359,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,i love how quiet this bluetooth is but i am not happy with the short battery life i talk a lot on my phone and i have to take the charger to work so that it is ready to use on the way home,44,77
3360,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i love my jawbone it truly does what it says i would not trade it for anything my husband no longer complains about not being able to hear me when he calls thank you very much,35,78
3361,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this product did not work with the new ear piece or with or without the ear hook because the white button moved away from the jawbone and the other party could not hear me i was about to send it back but borrowed a earpiece hook from my friend who had a jawbone 1 even with this earpiece the button lost contact with the cheek until i bent the shaft of the earpiece so the white button stayed against the jawbone and it works fine,82,79
3362,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,i read the reviews and everybody said that this was one of the best bluetooths on the market but i have to disagree when I am talking the receiver has a hard time hearing me and they say the words go in and out when you are speaking,46,80
3363,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,this product is by far the best i have owned after going through various and sundry motorola products and even after an upgrade to the predecessor jawbone which was such heavier and prone to broken ear loops this one is clearly my best yet and apart from the slight discomfort after prolonged use and clearly despite the aesthetics and in spite of the temptation to never take it off it is not jewelry you can not have everything but this is worth having,82,81
3364,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,today my jawbone got ran over and today i am buying another one because it is just that great it fits perfectly in my smallish ear connects quickly to my blackberry 8800 maintains the connection flawlessly the call quality is great and it provides clear voice both ways the only disappointment is that when in the lovely windy city of san francisco the jawbone does not cancel out wind noise it does however do a rather nifty job at canceling out my car stereo ultimately it is still the best looking headset out there and it works very well it is definitely worth a try or two,105,82
3365,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,i work for a telecommunication company so having bts are important I have gone through many and this would be one of the top i miss my original jawbone as it was clearer even our jawbone rep agreed it had better noise canceling technology I had still use it today if i did not smash it against my door i drive a convertible on occasion and this nor motorola h12 will live up to the par of the jawbone 1,77,83
3366,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have had a couple other bluetooth headsets this one is by far superior and for the price i love it i do not have any problems with fit noise reduction or sound i even dropped it in the rain and it worked fine well it did have to dry out before i could hear anyone but they heard me fine,60,84
3367,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,very poor design and reception people can not hear me clearly and the fit is extremely uncomfortable i was fooled by the reviews but by far this is the worst headset i have ever used my advice stick with the cheap models under 20 I have seen no considerable difference in call quality pretty much all headsets suck but at least you are not spending big bucks for nothing,68,85
3368,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,better than the original jawbone the only drawback i have is the leather earpiece loop for the ear was difficult to fit my face and it eventually broke i do like the other backup loop pieces theitself is great recommend you have the latest bluetooth sw on your phone to keep a solid connection,56,86
3369,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,fit seems to be a problem especially for the women out there just wanted to let folks know that on aliphs website manufacturer for the jawbone ii they have new ear gels that are supposed to provide better fit they are free with just 299 s / h maybe these will help improve your experience certainly worth a try update i gave this a shot and purchased it as well as the new fit ear buds they provide a much better fit and the headset is great others can hear me and i can hear them just fine with the new ear buds without them i had a hard time hearing others but they heard me just fine btw the ear buds are now 999 on the website but i emailed customer service and they sent them to me free of charge customer service was very helpful and responsive,144,87
3370,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,it took a bit for me to fit swapping parts and ear loops and getting the comfort right but I am grateful for the options some folks i know went cheap just purchasing the device and no extra fittings and were sorry they did after they saw the fitting options i had I had say overall not a feminine fit but i like the device admire the design and the features no one has ever noticed I had switched to bluetooth when i did with my iphone and i can do chores wash dishes and still sound like I am giving all my attention to them on my end bus subway busy sidewalk i can still hear everyone clearly and keep my voice level without any can you hear me nows it is like the dyson of bluetooth devices once i got over the coolness of the design i realized what a really great product it is,152,88
3371,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i had my jawbone shipped overnight so that i could be productive while working as soon as possible it arrived promptly the next day and a proceeded to set it up paring with my blackberry was easy but i had to go on another web site to figure out what code 0000 or the last 4 digits of you phone number my phone was asking for in order to complete paring the small earpiece was perfect for me although the medium ear loop is a bit big that does not matter since i can shake my head without loosing the jawbone with only the ear bud then i made my first call my best friend loved the sound quality difference at first she heard an echo but that was eliminated as soon as i lowered my phone volume to think all this time i was probable killing my ear drum at that high volume because i could not hear through my head set this weekend i will complete the ultimate convertible drive test i would recommend this to anyone but do all of the jawbone fans a favor go to a retail store and see if it fits your face although this device should fit most people i have noticed that fit is a major complaint from people that buy this online my experience is that it is great,223,89
3372,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,it has great sound quality far better than either of my phones alone i can not seem to find a comfortable adjustment for more than a few hours but overall it is a great device,34,90
3373,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have tried several different headsets but this one is the best and the noiseassassin is absolutely wonderful,18,91
3374,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,this is the first bluetooth device I have had it works fine with my palm treo 650 i suggest spending the time to set up your phone settings the way you want early on in the game also try out the different size earbuds and loops once you get the right combo it will be sweet the jawbone shuts down after 15 minutes and does not wake up / turn on in time to answer a call so if you want to keep it awake you have to push the button every 13 minutes or so before it turns off do not worry about the battery it stays plenty charged,105,92
3375,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,jawbone ii gold with the belief that this is the best basing on price and looks i purchased one but honestly i was dissapointed it is hard to pair and drops calls i like my old plantronics better,37,93
3376,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,this is a great product i had the jawbone i and the jawbone ii has a few features that are better it is smaller than the jawbone i it disconnects and answers calls faster than the jawbone i charging time is slightly faster than the jawbone i and it looks better than the jawbone i now for the drawbacks the fit is not at all any better or worse than the jawbone i the earloops are plastic and flimsy and do not provide for a snug fit in any case the earpieces come in small medium and large which is better than the odd-fitting ones in the jawbone i it is very easy to disconnect a call while trying to move the jawbone ii around for a better fit and it does not hold to the face quite as well as the jawbone i but that may be because it is smaller lighter and has a more delicate earloop overall the technology is state of the industry it works really well on both ends of the call it just needs a better earloop and earpiece system before i bought the jawbone ii i read the reviews on amazoncom and i also purchased the acoustibuds earpieces for the jawbone ii they are an aftermarket product that fits over the original earpieces that come with the jawbone ii and they do actually provide for a better fit when added the the earpieces that come with the jawbone ii they cost around 1699 but to me they are worth teh extra price because i use my headset on virtually every call i make or receive bottom line I have owned two different models and i liked them both definitely worth the money ps make sure you purchase the one in the retail packaging and not the bulk packaging if you want to get your moneys worth,299,94
3377,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,the jawbone does not say in place it falls out of your ear and when you try to place it back in your ear it disconnects your call i would love to send it back if i could and change it for another bluetooth do you think this would be possible nadia,52,95
3378,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,it works well the manufacturers should include a wider variety of ear piece sizes that is my only suggestion to make it better,22,96
3379,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,personally I am active i do not mean i am roping steers i do mean i might be walking through horse barns or dodging a calf or foal as shipped from the factory the device falls to the ground if i simply turn my head to the opposite side of the ear in which the jawbone-ii is worn i tried aliphs new ear-buds i tried their old ones i tried anfrom something else i read the jabra ear-gels now that did make the jawbone-ii tend to stay in the ear more often and it did keep that noise assassin part of the jawbone-ii firmly against my cheek for a while however it was annoying to the ear after a half-hour and equally annoying was the fact that the answer / disconnect / shut-off switch is ever so easily activated every single time i tried to adjust the earpiece whilst it was in the ear and referring to that infernal answer / disconnect / shut-off toggle if one had it in ones pocket turned on and a call came in grabbing it from the trousers did switch it off and disconnected the call and finally i happened to be testing my newly purchased jawbone-ii on freezing morning i had it in the ear and on a call a swift breeze started up and i pulled a wool watch cap down over my ears it is not a particularly tight one i own either that action the watch cap touching the jawbone-ii killed the call on thee bright side aliph the maker of jawbone-ii has great tech support responses they told me they would happily take it back and refund the full amount if it did not work out for me,279,97
3380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this is a great bluetooth once you get it paired with your cell phone which can be a little differcult i bought it for my wife and she is hard to please she has had several that or collecting dust but this one no complaints,44,98
3381,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,my wife and i have owned several different bluetooth sets over the years in general i would say that you get what you pay for there are many competent models for much cheaper but inevitably have one or more problems that range from slight annoyances to full blown issues i have been watching the jawbone for quite some time and was concerned about the polarity of the reviews people seem to either love it or hate it no middle ground however with my wife buying a blackberry it was time to also upgrade the bluetooth and guess what she does not want to also look like a techie so jawbone it was right out of the box it has performed flawlessly and I shall have to say that I am very impressed i wonder if the problems that have been noted on this space are related to either 1 personal fit has to touch the cheek everyone is different and/or 2 type of phone used have had this happen with other bluetooth units anyhow here is one vote saying it is worth what you pay for it,183,99
3382,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i purchased a subpar product the jawbone worked well for about a week after a week transmission and reception was so static filled that i had no choice but to return the product and i think I shall get a average priced bluetooth because after reviewing other products they all seem to be just average products,55,100
3383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,it is an awesome piece of equipment that works beautifully also have received numerous compliments on the aesthetics of the piece love it,22,101
3384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have had the jawbone for two weeks and it works very well the noiseassassin technology is impressive and overall sound quality is better than a few of the other headsets i have tried,34,102
3385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,two things really bothered me about this headset the unclear instructions for it is use and the terrible fit the sound quality is the best I have ever heard so it is disappointing that it does not fit snugly however the sound quality far outweighs any problem with the fit I had buy it again just for that reason,55,103
3386,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,this is my first bluetooth device and i use it way more than i thought it would i can hear people on my cell phone better than being on the phone directly and the people i call say i sound clearer as well it needs charging more often than the directions suggest and there is a little static on occasion,60,104
3387,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,this bluetooth is comfortable to wear and gives over 3 hours of continuous talk time on a full charge it also recharges in approximately 10 - 15 minutes the gold jawbone looks almost like a piece of jewelry i think the noise reduction technology is over rated the new sound id300 has a longer talk time and is as comfortable but does not charge as quickly,64,105
3388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,had the original jawbone which was great this one is smaller and works just as good the ear clip is ok could be better battery lasts as good as the older one also i would recommend this even although it is one of the highest priced units on the market you get what you pay for,58,106
3389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,product is fine except for ear holder i have tried all combinations of ear pieces and pads and the device will not stay on my ear and cheek it is always loose and causes me to have to hold it in place with my finger so people can hear me very poor ear piece design it barley comes over the top of the ear and i do not have big ears they need to provide a better ear holder as soon as possible i get no value from this product as it stands again it is not the technology but the stupid useless ear holder,101,107
3390,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,very dissapointed in this product had the original jawbone and loved it crackling speaker subject to outside interference not enough volume and new earbuds do not fit as well as old style on original earloop does not fit well either,40,108
3391,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i was really excited that the bluetooth actually fit better and buying the gold matched my hair wrong when i had to adjust the earpiece because it moved while i was on a call i would disconnect the call not to mention the quality of the voice i was listening to was scratchy then the volume would keep getting louder if you try and turn it off to use the phone without the earpiece it would not shut off talk about noise assassination i wanted to assassinate the earpiece i found it to be very frustrating disconnected all the time and hard to adjust i took it back for a refund,111,109
3392,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,works great great reception I am still getting used to the earpiece it is so light i often forget i have it on seems to drain the battery on my treo pretty quick although,32,110
3393,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,the earpiece is basically for looks it is lightweight and falls out of the ear constantly and everytime i go to adjust or put it back it hangs up on the person I am talking too the range with my 3 g iphone is not great either and the battery life lasts for about two phone calls and if it goes to stanby the next time you try it is dying on you the background noise is cut out while walking and talking basically it is only good for the looks and when using do not drop it,91,111
3394,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,works great but does not fit my ear too good and sharphurts my ear,16,112
3395,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i waited for this product gold version and bought it online as soon as it was available not smart the fit is horrible it falls out constantly in addition there is no case so it will turn on when it is touched by other items in my purse also the battery life is nano seconds this was a bad purchase decision and it cost too much whhich makes o sense given the poor fit i bought it for theand style instead of the quality my dad was right the best lessons are the ones we pay for,99,113
3396,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i have had this jawbone for only about 2 months it works like a charm great investment i have owned other bluetooth earpieces b4 motorola basically all models the jabra and i feel like there is nothing that can compare to this niose assasin invention shop on shop on,49,114
3397,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,this headset performs much better than expected i have bought many bluetooth headsets with the goals of finding one that stayed paired to phone had clear sound had excellent range between phone and headset was comfortable on ear and provided noice cancelling features this tops out all categories pairing with the iphone 3 g was a breeze i can even talk with the windows down while driving on the freeway,69,115
3398,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,I have been using the jawbone ii gold head set for about 4 months now and it is perfect it is so comfortable i forget i have it on i actually prefer to talk on my cell using the headset instead of the phone itself it is that clear I am sure it has something to do with the earbud being in the ear but it sounds like I am talking on the regular phone at home I have used it in many noisy settings and have had the other party tell me they hear me clearly with no interference it is very easy to connect with my cellphone sony-ericcson and the battery lasts as long if not longer than the phone battery i do not really have any cons to report except to say that i did try the variety of ear loops and ear buds that come with it before finding the combination that gave me a great fit,155,116
3399,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with the new jawbone i always thought the old product was too big this product is light and the noiseassassin feature works great,27,117
3400,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,i purchased this as a birthday gift for my wife as her motorola 850 was starting to give her problems you would think that after 38 years of marriage i would have known she did not want something sticking in her ear i convinced her to try it and she did for a week i then got her a motorola h800-b slider which she loves i inherited the jawbone since my plantronics 510 had worn out i originally thought i would have problems with the little bud hitting my cheek since i have a full beard but there was no problem i used the jabra earbuds with this set to fit my ear better and they make this an almost perfect unit i drive an 18-wheeler all week and this really helps people hear me better over all of the cab noise which is significant in an older truck the distance problem some others have is not an issue since the phone lg vx-9800 hangs on a clip above the windshield if i am not in the truck the phone is on my belt all in all i am glad i made the mistake in the gift i never would have spent this much on a set for myself but it was well worth the money make sure you get the jabra eargels although they are 100 better than the oem rubbers that came with the phone i generally have my headset on for most of the day i am driving / working 10 to 14 hours and i forget it is there the only downside was my remembering to grab it by the sides and keep my big fingers off the front so i did not keep hanging up on people by touching the little button on the front,296,118
3401,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,although people talk about this product as if it has star trek technology this headset looks better than it functions it does not cancel noise completely as friends who talk to me have said one could hear me washing the dishes as i spoke to her it also does not have a 33 ft range more like 15 feet also i have to turn toward the phone in order for the signal to be stronger even when i am next to the phone if i block the signal with my body i get bad quality sound in fact since i do not have a car and mainly wanted this for use around my small house it has been a big disappointment to me i am barely using it my advice if you do alot of driving then this will work well for you as you can leave your phone in one position relative to the headset and the sound quality will remain okay or if you have a circular house and can leave the phone in the middle point otherwise i think you are better off buying a less expensive one until the quality of this type improves,199,119
3402,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,postives much smaller and lighter with good battery life newgold is a good choice easier to put on ear negatives does not stay touching cheek static if the phone is on the opposite side of the body from the earpiece listeners say they can not understand the conversation readjusting pressure to cheek usually corrects so it is a problem,61,120
3403,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,excellent sound quality and presentation where it suffers is that it does not sit snugly in the ear i have tried the alternative hooks and more that came with it but feel there is a design flaw that does not allow the headset to stay secure i have pretty normal ears but there is this problem had i known of this before i purchased it i would not have bought it also the gold does not look gold in the ad they model it on a beautiful dark lady and the contrast made it look great but in real like it is more an ochre setting the volume is also an issue there should be a way to keep the setting once it has been set i need it loud but have to keep adjusting it,135,121
3404,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,4.0,positive,i really like this product i drove on the highway at 70 mph alternately raising and lowering my window and my friend could not tell the difference i sounded completely clear to him in both cases clearer than when i was just using my phone inside my apartment just to be clear the jawbone does not claim to make the other person sound clear to you rather it makes you sound clear to the other person so if you could not hear the other person on your phone before the jawbone is not going to help you much it does let you choose from several volume options some which get quite loud and actually hurts my ears because you have to scroll through the volume settings you can not just choose the one you want and you can not go backwards on the list I have found the best solution is to leave it on it is quietest setting and set the bluetooth volume through my krzrs bluetooth volume settings sometimes i get static and lose signal if the phone is out of line of sight of the earpiece including if it is in my pants pocket on the other side of my body but i think this is because the krzrs bluetooth signal is not that strong my friend with an htc touch phone has no problems with his jawbone losing connection with his phone i can walk pretty far away from my phone without static occuring if the jawbone maintains a line of sight connection with it the combination of beautiful form and above average noise cancellation makes for a great bluetooth headset,266,122
3405,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,i found that this headset delivered on it is technology promise people hear me a lot better now when i call with my treo 755p which was a problem before my main gripe with this headset although is the fit i just can get the thing to fit around my ear a couple of people who have the same model that i talked to had the same issue i am amazed that with such a sophisticated device they can not get this to work especially as the previous model had the same complaints from customers,93,123
3406,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,it could be a good product jawbone works well out of the box although it is hard to get it to fit comfortably nothing they make will hold up long as far as i can tell jawbones version of customer service is a sweet voice telling you to stop complaining the customer service issue is the clincher this company relies on marketing not quality and not service i will be surprised if they stay in business through 2009,78,124
3407,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,after trying several other headsets i decided to spend the money on what was rumored to be the best while it looks good and is packaged well the instructions are minimal this headset seems to rely more on being used with the phone but is difficult if you are trying to use it by itself pushing the button on the headset to make the call is still something I am trying to figure out I have mostly had to open my phone and do the dialing there other headsets I have had make it a lot easier to make a call also the noise assassin feature works when it is on but it is hard to tell whether it is on or off there has not much of an indication people on the other end of the line sound pretty good but they say i sound tinny when i use the headset one thing i did like about this headset is that it is light as opposed to it is much-heavier predecessor,163,125
3408,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,i have the older style and this was my attempt to try the new style pros 1 smaller 2 better fitting than original 3 super sexy 4 fits in the pocket easier 5 charges super fast 6 light as air cons 1 loop broke within 1 week no shocker old style broke fast too 2 battery goes dead insanely fast can not make it half the day 3 range is horrible less than half the old version about 5 feet clear 10 ft scratchy with my iphone 3 g 4 i think you have to turn on noise cancel every time or I am doing something wrong 5 it is almost too light you forget you have it in your ear summary this is an improvement over the old jawbone which killed my ear broke ear loops constantly however the decrease in range and battery life is a real killer be prepared to buy more earloops complain to the company and maybe even turn on the noise cancelling if it were not for the noise cancel and sexy factor i would give it a 1 star but apple has shown us you can take your customers for a ride if you just make it look good enough i own 4 macs no pcs hope this helps,212,126
3409,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,5.0,positive,the jawbone is a great product fits well and is the best blue tooth i have ever had you can hear the person on the other end perfectly in the wind or with any back ground noise i like the goldbecause it is unique i have had motorola blue tooths and they have fallen apart,57,127
3410,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,i find thisfor it is price to be very deficient on reception the snap crakle and pop i hear when using it reminds me of rice crispies and maybe this was just a prize not an expensive piece of hardware i am sending back for a refund save yourself and keep looking,53,128
3411,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,like other people i was excited about this thing the sound is pretty much what they say i used it a couple times with sunglasses on as it was the only way to keep the thing on and the could hear and be heard pretty well with a fair amount of background noise as soon as the shades came off so did the headset if the ear hook was flexible and you could bend it to the contour of your ear it would be perfect but as it is rigid i had to hold the thing in or wear sunglasses what good is a hands-free set if it is not hands-free i instead got a plantronics 925 and it seems to be doing the trick and is far more comfortable anyway,130,129
3412,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,3.0,neutral,the voice is not as clear and the earloop does not fit as well as jawbone l,17,130
3459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,2.0,negative,the concept is nice the price is right but this product is not worth the effort followed directions to the letter and still to many air bubbles after several tries took film off put it back in it is packaging and threw it the trunk of my car probably to never use again besides the iphone screen is made of glass so it cleans up easy one or two wipes with a micro cloth and you are good to go,80,0
3460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,3.0,neutral,I have only used one film from the pack and it is lasted one year it is an okay product but it is not a smudge-free film,24,1
3461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,4.0,positive,this product is great for your iphone 3 g the installation was a smooth process if you follow the directions on the inside of the package the film was a very precise fit although it does leave a very slight blur to the detail but every smudge free film tends to have some blur to it overall i would recommend this product to anyone that has an iphone 3 g,68,2
3462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,5.0,positive,i was so so so pleased with this product went on in 2 seconds with no bubbles microfiber cleaner cloth worked great too had originally bought the screen covers from apple store impossible to apply without bubbles i was blown away by the ease of application with this product i bought the ones for my iphone and hubbys lg vu i recommend,62,3
3463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,5.0,positive,this is by far the best screen protector i have ever used the phone responds exactly like it did without the protector plus there is no glare and my finger just glides across the screen,35,4
3464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,4.0,positive,a good and very cheap anti-glare screen protector installation was easy and the cutouts were precise enough to stay away from the home button and the earpiece very little if any fingerprints show up and makes the screen readable under direct light now when i take the train the sun does not bother me the film does blur and lower the brightness of the screen a bit but that comes with all antiglare overall a good purchase for those that want to try anti-glare and not pay a premium at the apple store,92,5
3465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,1.0,negative,at least this product is simple to install without getting air bubbles under it but the anti glare coating makes it completely annoying to have covering your screen all of the icons are annoyingly grainy and unsightly i have used other protective films that do not have such a profoundly negative effect on the enjoyment of having such a nice large screen i think that the marware protector is a good combination of being easy to install and still being clear enough not to ruin your iphone experience the marware product also has the cut outs for the light sensors on the 3 g iphone which is important for several reasons the 3 elago films i purchased are going into the trash can,121,6
3466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,5.0,positive,personally i do not like to put anything on my iphone but this thing really changed my minds toward iphone accessaries now i do not have to clean my screen with shirt everytime i use my phone the quality seems good so far and it gives me clearer images than other smudge free films i tried a cheap chinese made one and it was horrible price is reasonalbe and it came with everything i needed after all it is made in united states,80,7
3467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,3.0,neutral,this product comes in a very nice package and everything is very luxury however the back coating on the screen protecter when u go to apply it is very difficult to come off and it is almost immpossable to get all the air bubbles out and like some of the other reviews said it sort of ruins the amazing resolution of the screen again it is what it says smudge free i would be more satisfied if it did some with maybe 2 screen protectors instead of 1 next time i am going to try the power support crystal film set which comes with 3 and i have a friend who has it and loves it,116,8
3468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,3.0,neutral,yes this film remains smudge free however it seems impossible to eliminate all of the bubbles under the film after following the instructions carefully there are still a few pesky bubbles remaining decent product but i think a bit overpriced,40,9
3469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,4.0,positive,the application of this film was very easy the instructions are clear and the cleaning cloth is helpful i was worried that i would mess it up and have wasted my money but there is no reason to worry about that i am sure this will protect it from being scratched by the things in my purse i use it along with griffin wave for iphone 3 g and 3 g s white and it looks fits works just great unlike some other screen protectors this one does not affect the touch screen however the anti glare does make things look a bit fuzzy turning up the brightness helps a lot however if you do a lot of reading on your phone email and ebooks and surfing you might find it distracting I am getting used to it for me the anti-glare is more important than the clarity as I am using my phone outside a lot,153,10
3470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,1.0,negative,I have used a number of different screen films and figured elago would be worth a try based on the quality of other products these smudge free films are horrid however the resolution / clarity of the screen is dreadful under these things and worse still the thing basically looks like one big smudge itself the film collects an amazing amount of oils and crud which while not technically smudgy are definitely visible at 6 a piece you might be tempted but by the time you pay for shipping this is just as expensive as anything they well at the at t store and most certainly far worse in quality and satisfaction,106,11
3471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,2.0,negative,this is a very stylish case it looks really nice and I have received compliments on it however I am not sure about the level of protection it provides since i have not ever dropped my iphone i imagine it would do an adequate job although the chrome bezel around the phone would be vulnerable because it does not wrap around the phone my one concern with this phone which is a major one is that the rubber coating starts peeling off at the bottom corner I have only had the case for 2 months and it already started doing this i would have rated it as a 5 just for how snazzy it looks but the latter concern prompted me to write a review as a warning to others fyi i take very good care of my stuff in general and my phone has not undergone any abuse / never ever been dropped / and more,147,12
3472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,1.0,negative,i would not recommend this product it creates tons of bubbles it is not smudge free waste of money get the actual apple one which is bubble / smudge free,27,13
3473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,3.0,neutral,i am underwhelmed by this product i can live with the grainy look that it gives the iphone but i could not manage to apply the product without air bubbles being trapped on the face very annoying,37,14
3474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,4.0,positive,i like this screen cover i bought this for my iphone 1st gen and it worked fine however i had to trim the sides a little bit i did not think iphone 3g/3gs had wider screen than the 1st gen i guess it is a little bit anyway if you want to buy this for your 1st gen iphone be advised that this is a little wider for it other than that it is perfect,74,15
3475,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,5.0,positive,service is excellent got my product in very good condition and this product is a must have for iphone users not only it looks good on it but it protects and makes your phone looking brand new,37,16
3476,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL8PLW,1.0,negative,this was a waste of money bubbled up no matter what i did and by the time i got it on without any bubbles tiny dust particles got stuck to the adhesive and were annoyingly visible i used this for about 10 minutes and then went back to the naked look and feel,53,17
3477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,the elegant design metallic case quality display overall operability of the phones standard communications and convenience features and even an amazingly clear built-in speaker should please any user not inclined toward heavy text-messaging or web-surfing and all of this pleased me until my phone stopped working after 2 months instead of starting up it just began flashing a white screen for a few seconds got a replacement and 2 months later that phone died an identical death ordered a new replacement as this was mandatory given my mobile service agreement and in 2 more months I shall get back with you getting back with you phone just broke again same problem although this time it lasted an amazing 4 months worse news is t-mobile is forcing me to take a fourth one before i can upgrade to something that may actually endure for awhile my fifth replacement phone is on the way can not wait,152,0
3478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,the sierra wireless card is flimsy and has defects there is some glitch that when it updates it is software it kills the wireless unit I have had 4 of these replaced now the biggest rip off of all is that sprint warehouse says it is does nt receive them back and sprint charges you 100 after 15 days this time i mailed it back with postal certification to prove it was received by them sprint customer service says they acknowledge there has a problem but they have to just send the information higher into their management chain i also had a sprint lotus phone widely known for being defective and yet sprint still sells them to this day sprint has ripped me off bottom line I am posting this as a warning to others avoid sprint,131,1
3479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,if i did not have a contract I had cancel and find another way to get internet service i really really hate this broadband service i like in a city so there is not reason for the terrible service i get level of connection is given in percentages 0 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 the only place I have ever gotten 100 was in an airport at my house it is frequently at 0 or 10 most commonly at 40 at 40 you can not watch video you have to have at least 60 for that which i rarely get i called sprint and someone actually told me that they can not guarantee service inside where the he shall else am i going to use the internet on my roof my contract is up next year i think and after 5 years with sprint i am going to change providers i want to have an internet connection that works consistently in my house and if they sent me and countless others a product that they can not guarantee will work in the place that most people use it then i am finished with sprint,190,2
3480,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,3.0,neutral,i got this phone to replace an old one after trying many other phones whose battery life was not what i expected i like the phone except that it has dust under the screen can not really see much of the screen out of doors or in the sunlight because of the dust called t-mobile who will not replace it because it is out of their 30 day warranty and nokia told me to go to t-mobile the phone is only 4 months old so I am not real happy probably would not purchase another nokia,90,3
3481,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,do not buy this phone i bought this phone 3 weeks ago through t-mobile and the screen on the front has cracked i did not drop it or put pressure on it it was sitting on my table and when i flipped the phone open it was cracked now i can not see who is calling or the time to fix it will cost over 70 and to replace it will cost me over 100 not worth it,77,4
3482,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,i rather like this phone the internal screen is very impressive however the phones reception is not that good I have tested 2 different t-mobile phones in the same area and this phone has the worse reception the phone is very good-looking it does not look durable although the keys do not feel comfortable if you text a lot they are not very responsive so you can not type very fast,67,5
3483,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,3.0,neutral,this is a pretty good standard flip phone come with the usual camera but this has flash photo quality is not too bad but what can you really expect from a cell phone built in mp3 player and radio need the antenna headset which is provided both that cam be played through the speakerphone built in bluetooth an expandable micro sd slot a button on the side of the hinge that opens the flip phone for you and mini usb connectivity to your computer wire did not come with my phone it has a few games that come with the phone but they are all demos the only problem I have come across for me at least is the hinge i had bought the phone on 3/28/09 and the side of the hinge cracked about a month later some may say that i had dropped the phone i can assure you that it has never happened right now I am in contact with nokia since t-mobile will not replace my phone because it is was over their 30 day policy i notified them on the 32nd day i was two days away my review will be updated once i get an answer from nokia regarding my problem other than that the phone was been great for me the 1 month I have had so far update ok nokia replaced my phone and it was covered under warranty customer service was really nice and kind to me over all i had a good repair experience one one gripe although i sent them my original phone box and in return i got back my phone in a flat rate box from the postal office i would think as a multi billion dollar company that they would return my box it is just something minor rating stays as is,302,6
3484,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,this modem replaced my sierra 597 that kept dropping signal in an unreliable sprint 3 g service area this 598 modem is much more stable and with the external antenna connection gives me 4 - 5 bars of signal strength it is connected to a cradlepoint wireless router that makes our rural home a great hotspot and downloads movies to the roku box,60,7
3485,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,perfect product high quality can not go wrong with this product as i have used it for 2 years and have had no problems,21,8
3486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,3.0,neutral,I have used one of these for about 6 months it is not as fast as they make it about to be or so i thought for the past 6 months i used it in airports hotels and more and it is definitely not high speed at times it seemed like a fast dial up service does anyone remember those days however last week i treated myself to an ipad and bought a cradlepoint portable router phs 300 a great little device that allowed me to attach the 598u so that i would not have to fork over another 30 to at t the speed has tripled since setting it up through the cradlepoint device not just for the ipad but for my laptop so if you want to see any decent speed you will have to spend another 100 best news i was able to get the wifi ipad which saved me 130 on that,149,9
3487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,lots of great features but it takes about 20 minutes worth of swearing and yanking to get the back cover off that means good luck getting to the micro sd card and the usb is not a standard shaped port when you are trying to get the cover off it likes to pull up random functions like voice recognition so then you have to stop what you are doing and exit out then when you get back to business it starts randomly calling people the nifty screen on the outside is delicate mine broke in my pocket you can not save received photos and videos to sd other than that pretty good but when you are dealing with one of it is weaknesses you will blow your top,122,10
3488,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,i have had mobile broadband through sprint for three years it was finally time to get a new modem and i chose this one i am sorry i did it gets no reception inside or outside of my house this little modem is getting sent back to sprint as soon as possible,49,11
3489,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,I have had wireless from sprint for 6 years now never have i had a problem traveled down the entire east coast and only dropped service once even worked well in the mountains i just recently upgraded to this modem works just as well had a higher rated modem for two days from sprint but had problems returned it and got this one instead had no issues with sprint this works well and would highly recommend it is cheaper than home based internet and less problems and better service,88,12
3490,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,i have this card and it works ok the service where i am in tucson gives me about 40 to 60 percent i did buy a antennae from [ ] and it works awesome with this card it is a booster antenna w / cables for sierra aircard 598u i get 80 100 percent with the antenna plugged in,56,13
3491,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,i do not know what the previous reviewers expectations are but the device will only work as well as the service connection for your area i live in an area where we had only dial up or satellite for internet available to us until this and let me tell you the blazing speeds i get with this comparatively make it well worth it to me in a rural area i think within about a mile of the tower i get consistently 2 mb coverage it works perfectly runs probably easily 12 hours / day and I have had it for 10 months the only time it has gone down everything in my area is down including landline and cell phones actually that happened a couple days before thanksgiving everything was down but my sierra wireless was still delivering dial up speed connection,142,14
3492,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,so I am the type of person who really takes care before making a purchase such as a cell phone because i intend to own it until it is no longer workable however i bought this phone back in november on a bit of a whim because my old cell phone which endured for more than three years had finally broken to the point of no return and i love it it is modern easy to use five-fave compatible and offers a lot more space for storing pictures and music than my previous phone the camera takes nice pictures the sound is good if you are looking to hear a little music and your ipod is dead and there are really cool pre-set themes you can choose from my only contention is that the flip action is not especially smooth but I am used to the slider phone i had for three years before this happy cell phone hunting,154,15
3493,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,got this phone through our cell phone provider and the screen has a noticeable crack in it now only 2 months young we were told that this is sturdy but can not figure out how the inner screen cracked although the outer plastic did not and it was not dropped either not made as well as older nokia phone models seems to have cheaper plastic very disappointed we would not recommend this phone due to it is lack of quality materials,74,16
3494,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,i bought an htc tilt 2 when replacing a blackberry bold 9000 end of contract / changing to a new phone it was the flavor of choice and had a number of things i wanted i had it for three weeks of the time all the windows features worked fine did not have difficulty with freezes or other things that people reported i set up my email and it failed numerous times would not automatically send / receive without going thru hoops anything sent was visible for 1and anything received was also visible for 1there was no auto-delete function invoked i was on the phone with at t for 6 hrs over the course of the last two weeks they agreed there was a problem i took it into an at t store where their store management reproduced the problems down to the last one and said he agreed too lacking the email function this smart phone is not such a smart phone and not worth the box it came in i replaced it paying the difference in with a blackberry torch I have now had it 3 weeks the torch and have had zero problems and have not had a need to call tech support not even once one other thing that should be changed the keys and the backlighting make for difficult use of the keys unless the room is dim keyor backlightshould be changed good luck with your purchase or find something else,251,0
3495,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,this is a really good device i have had many cellphones and pdas and this is one of the best ones i have ever had it is durable has good battery life and an easy to use qwerty keyboard the tilting action makes it easy to see what you are typing with no glare the video resolution is good and sd card makes it as expandable as you want you can switch out cards if you start running out of room or want to keep some files private i highly recommend this device i have used it in a busy medical practice loaded with references and resources and with the google mobile apps bar i am on the internet in a flash and can access the web or my google apps luckily it is pretty much drop proof,138,1
3496,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,4.0,positive,as the title suggests i consider this smartphone to be a good work horse a previous poster listed a few features on this device I have expanded some of the detail on that and added some other info tether as a modem very helpful and less expensive than buying a standalone aircard full keyboard there is a soft keyboard you can type on without having to slide out the keyboard everytime you need to type something can open edit save microsoft office files word powerpointon an iphone you can only view not edit screen tilts helpful to reduce glare create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking without additional cost helpful tips for windows mobile periodically windows mobile devices experience registry corruption the best resolution is to perform a hard reset on the device clearing out the memory and essentially freshly building the device by doing these periodic resets in my experience 2 times a year is necessary the device remains responsive and less buggy there is a lot of functionality built into the tilt that is handy it is one of the better windows devices for navigation using a bluetooth gps bug the device can do quite well guiding without the necessity of having to buy a singletasking handheld navigation system,226,2
3497,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,this phone stinks i doubt i will buy another htc product it has been nothing but problems since i purchased it at a much higher price i can not wait to replace it,33,3
3498,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,why buy these 250 phones and get stuck with a 2-year contract when the phone does not last even a year it is almost like bait and switch by at t they stop carrying the particular expensive phone in less than a year so when the phone dies in a few months at t will not have to exchange it with a new one for you but they got your contract for 2 years with a cheaper phone in exchange before wasting your money on a new expensive at t smartphone ask yourself if you are ok with having to warranty exchange your new phone with a used refurbished one in less than a year,108,4
3499,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,i had one just like this before someone robbed me so i know what i was buying yeah this is not an iphone or a new phone with android but with a few hints you can make of this old smartphone it was released in 2007 works pretty damm well i install the windows mobile 65 and the performance of the phone improves a lot much faster without freezes I have installed a cooked version of the phoenix iii with touchflo i have the newest opera mobile garmin xt foursquare youtube and the performance is quite well the battery life is acceptable using wifi or the 3 g networks 1 day fully charged I am from chile and the purchase and shipping were faster and without problems,124,5
3500,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,phone-1/1 phone was brand new and exactly what i wanted packaging-4/5 although they did give me a charger for my phone it was from another phone but it is okay total 5/6 good sellers would recommend to anyone looking for bargain phones,41,6
3501,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,it usally takes a lot of headache before i leave a bad review I have had my share with this phone I have been fighting with it since about july of 2010 since my previous tilt was having problems it was pretty old but it worked i thought that replacing it with a tilt 2 would be a greatwrong the tilt 2 is / has slow locks up freezes all the time poor keyboard layout stupid magnet in stylus really I had like to slap the engineer that thought of this you will see the issue when you have got a case with a magnetic catch will not work with my redfly thanks a lot m voice dial / command is a joke and a bad one at that predictive typing is nonexistant pokcket ie another bad joke it is horrible pocket outlook crashes or freezes all the time sometimes it just stops working and does not get new email so htc and micro oft you did a great job converting me to be android user an no i will not be replacing it with a winmob 7 phone,187,7
3502,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,2.0,negative,I have had and loved other htc phones this one does not live up to it is brand at all i bought two for my girls this past christmas and they have had nothing but problems despite being long time cell phone users part of the problem is the crappy windows software but even if that was not a pita the hardware is already falling apart and it is just mid-january the tilt feature broke the first week in one of them i bought extra batteries for them and it is a good thing because the battery life is almost non-existent also they are very bulky so if you want a fairly light or small phone this is not it,115,8
3503,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,4.0,positive,phone is a very good a bit heavy but makes up for it is speed and keyboard very adaptable to large fingers very good buy maybe buy one for a friend,30,9
3504,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,2.0,negative,after i bought this phone i had some problem wiht the closeing the cover after puting the battary so i send amozon a e-mail say can you provide me with diffrent cover and will pay for your cover what ever cost they did not resond me the phone it self is that much worth buy becuase you can not customize the ring tone,63,10
3505,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,3.0,neutral,i read all of the reviews and even checked online to make sure this was a good phone it is not a smart phone it is the most stupid phone I have ever owned and i intend to return it as soon as possible it took 3 days of searching online to find out how to download ringtones to the phone that the phone will actually let me use nothing in the manual or the online manual tells you the hoops you have to jump thru if there had not been a blog I had have never figured it out this phone shuts off immeditately if i turn it on and accidentally turn my hand sideways while holding it it will not get at t service at my house even although my at t go phone gets a signal without a problem it will not hook to the 3 g network half the time i bought this phone new so it was not remanufactured do not waste your time or money,159,11

3509,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used it for my pioneer f90bt in my chevy impala 02 works great i guess hopes this helps some one like it helped me,24,0
3510,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,i used this product to install a clarion cx-501 into a 2010 chev colorado this product did it is job and lined up well in the truck,26,1
3511,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this mounting kit worked well for the jvc double din hd i installed in my colorado it took a couple of reads through the manual as it is not extremley detailed to understand the mounting take your time and inspect the factory mounting you have to remove a number of the plastic tabs from the side mounts it did fit well and secure once screwed in note removing the faceplate on the colorado to access the stereo was easy look for it on you tube,85,2
3512,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,face plate did not fit it was too small for the pyle pldd75bg 7 in double din for my 2005 express cargo van check the metra site and it said this kit was for my van only used the side mounts to hold the pyle in the dash,48,3
3513,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i ordered this to use in a 2003 chevy tracker the faceplate would not fit with the trackers original dashboard radio cover but it did fit the boss 822ua in-dash double-din cd / mp3 receiver with front panel aux input usb sd card that i was putting in the tracker not using the mounting kit faceplate was no big deal the radio fit in the dash nicely and looks fine with just the original dashplate the mounting brackets had many different mounting variations and naturally noone of them lined up exactly right i drilled some holes to make them attachable to the radio then decided if I am going to drill holes i might as well drill them in the mounting brackets from the stock radio which i know will match the mounting holes in the front of the dash so i did long story short i gave this 3 stars because it was not a bad piece of equipment but it was not compatible out of the box with the 03 tracker even although when i looked it up it stated it was,179,4
3514,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,bought this adapter for my new head unit in my 2006 isuzu ascender and it did not fit it also does not fit together properly but even if it did it still would not fit waste of 15,35,5
3515,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,it does what it describes one gripe i have although is that the screws used to attach the headunit do not have any tooling so you must use a wrench and some elbow grease i do not see any significant security in this because if a thief wants you radio he can just as easily take the mounting bracket with it only way i can see improving this product is to make the screws an allen or flathead or something,79,6
3516,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it said i could fit this in my car when i looked it up on amazon i ordered this and found out after putting in the new radio that it did not fit my chevy trailblazer 05 u might get lucky but do not count on it even if the page says it will fit,53,7
3517,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,center bezel did not fit the stereo kenwood dpx502bt i even dremeled it out to be as large as possible still too small i ended up just mounting the side brackets directly to the head unit with some screws i had laying around and tossing the bezel in the trash be aware that the plastic side brackets are made out of fairly thick and hard plastic it can not be cut with a utility knife as stated in the directions you will need a cut-off wheel on a small rotary tool or possibly something like a jewelers saw to remove whatever mounting tabs are not for your vehicle,104,8
3518,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fit perfect with my new pioneer app radio 4 for reference i have a 07 chevy colorado,17,9
3519,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,fit in my 2008 chevy colorado perfectly 1 star for risking breaking it to cut the other model tabs,19,10
3520,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,received kit it came with two right sides so i had to take a dremmal and make it fit said it would for my car stereo unit it did not had to grind the cheap ass plastic down made it work but it took forever,44,11

3524,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,not the best fit with my jvc head unit but i did manage to beat on my rodeos faceplate / dash and got it to at least look like it fit properly laughing out loud,31,15
3525,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,brackets worked fine after alot of cutting the faceframe did not fit although fortunately i did a pretty good job installing my radio so did not need it,26,16
3526,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,fits the truck 2005 trailblazer but would not fit my kenwood ddx3 had to custom mount it materials were pretty cheap and instructions were terrible,25,17
3527,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,cheapo but if you are careful and know what you are doing you can make this work,15,18
3528,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the side plates probably would have worked if the tabs i need had not broke while trying to cut off the tabs that are not needed as directed by the instructions one had no room around it for using a razor blade knife it was the last tab i had to do and a few needed tabs were very close to it that they ended up being broken off i am not sure how i could have been more careful,78,19
3529,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this was exactly what i needed to have to put my double din in my 2003 malibu it even had a factory finish on it that matched perfect with my vehicle interior great product fits perfect looks great,38,20
3530,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,worked great and easy to use once you figure out which tabs to remove product seems flimsy but looks to be rigid enough for it is intended purpose make sure to read the manual first,34,21
3531,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fits my radio installation in my 2005 suburban just be careful when cutting the tabs if you make a mistake you will have to order another kit,27,22

3533,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,once installed correctly this works great and for a good price despite reading reviews saying to be careful about cutting the rights tabs i cut too many and ruined it on one side i had to order a second one good thing they are cheap,45,24
3534,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,works for chevy silverado 1500 hd read and follow the directions and it works well with no rattles or squeaks,20,25
3535,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i ordered a weird sized radio from japan and had to do some resizing with my dremel but all in all it worked out good,25,26
3536,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,should be made from a little stronger material,8,27
3537,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the tabs do not break easily and then when they do you my break anothe you wanted to keep,18,28
3538,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,the only thing i dislike about it is the sides do not snap in securely it would have worked great except amazon misinformed me that the stereo i bought would fit my 06 chevrolet silverado this caused me to accidentally break on side of the bracket,45,29
3539,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,i bought this to install my pioneer appradio into my 2007 chevy silverado 2500 classic body install was straight forward but the head unit sit too low i probably remove and tried to adjust the unit at lease 4 - 5 times with no luck my cousin with the simlar setup with a apline head unit has the same issue,58,30
3540,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,extremely cheap i have installed many stereos and this broke within two days,13,31
3541,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,one of the great pains in the ass of my life you have to carefully saw away all the pieces you do not need to make it work for your particular mount i get it metra can not release a million different variations but seriously some kind of perforations or something would have been so helpful so much work on the consumer end but it got my stereo mounted in the end so thanks but metra you should perforate it make it so much easier,83,32
3542,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,not for the average joe requires a lot of cutting and fitting to make it useful unuseable tabs have to be cut with a saw instead of simple break off,30,33
3543,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,works as advertised on my 04 siverado was kind of pain to break off all the tabs could be a bit more solid,23,34
3544,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,needed a lot of modification to fit just have some tools handy i was not upset because the fit is perfect now but it is not a direct install,27,35
3545,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,perfect after-marketfinish for the 2005 toyota sienna,9,36
3546,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i purchased this to use on a 2003 chevy silverado having to break off the unnecessary tabs based on unclear instructions was not ideal but once i got it modified as outlined in instructions it fit ok there has still a smallbetween this and my factory trim if i were to do this again i would buy a different brand,61,37

3548,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,it works however the curve of the bezel does not match the trim at the top of the bezel where it meets the dash on my 2008 gmc sierra 1500 wt,30,39
3549,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,just like any dash kit from walmart this is terrible quality breaking the tabs i needed to to make it fit the holes was very hard but breaking the ones i needed to keep by accident was all too easy i do not recommend this or sosche,46,40
3550,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,screw holes do not line up right i had to buy a different one,13,41
3551,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,as other reviewers have noted you have to cut a lot of tabs off the kit in order to install it and the directions were not completely correct for my 2003 gmc envoy however it was not hard to figure out what to do and the installation looks good,48,42
3552,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,nothing in this kit works on a 2002 suburban,9,43

3555,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,i bought this to help install an aftermarket radio on a 96 buick regal if you follow instructions which are clear enough it is easy to install and does exactly what it says it will do you do have to cut off a lot of tabs but it is relatively soft plastic and very easy to do,57,46
3556,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,poor fitment for my 2003 tahoe the radio was not centered in the dash bezel right and there was aabout 1/8th inch between the dash kit and bezel there are no adjustments on this kit so i ended up cutting and plastic welding a lot on this to make it right,52,47
3557,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it says it works for chevy avalanche but it do does not line up at all,16,48
3558,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,i had to cut pieces of it to fit in 2002 crv way to much work trying to figure it out,21,49
3559,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this is one of the cheapest easiest kits that can be purchased fit exactly as it was supposed to and i did not even need to read instructions great durability has been installed for years now with zero issues i recommend it,42,50
3560,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,i bought this as it was reccomended to fit a 2004 chevy silverado i guess sure it fits in the sense that the radio is held in there however the radio pushes against the trim and none of the supplied screws worked it is held in place by one bolt on a silverado all over i would not buy this kit for any vehicle spend the extra few bucks for a better version this one is terrible cheap plastic worse instructions i had to cut some tabs off to test mount it so without even putting it in to see if it fits i can not return it garbage steer clear,108,51
3561,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,it is kind of difficult to cut off the tabs if fit my 03 avalanche but it did not fit the double din stereo,23,52
3562,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,this is the second time I have bought one of these and the second time I have had to get my drill and pocket knife out to make it work they are chevy trucks they are not that rare,35,53
3563,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,makes the radio sit too low in my 2005 suburban the display hits dash trim when it opens and closes using pioneer x5700bhs,23,54
3564,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,this kit is terrible in a 2004 escalade the radio did not clear the bottom and sits about an 8th inch out,21,55
3565,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fit the car dash and new stereo perfectly my son is very happy,13,56
3566,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,be sure to buy a saw and sandpaper at the same time have to cut off most of the tabs and cut and sand to make it fit,28,57
3567,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,equipment was as described and was exactly what was needed,10,58
3568,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,works great but it is not intended for a rookie to install these require quite a bit of customization to make them fit perfectly there are not any better options so purchase with the understanding that if you do not know what you are doing it will fit like crap if you are slightly handy then get after it you will be fine,61,59
3569,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,easy to assemble and install breaking the tabs that was not going to be used was not tricky either some people cut them but i find it easier to get it completely assembled bolted down and then break the useless tabs off carefully bending back and forward until it breaks leaving a smooth flat surface make sure you know the tabs you need to keep,63,60
3570,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,this installation kit was pretty bad it said in the manual and on amazon that it fit my car but it certainly did not i had to cut all the corners off and remove the face place for it to fit so double check the manual before buying I am sure it is on metras website somewhere do not just assume that since amazon says it fits it will fit also there are many pieces on the mounting brackets the side pieces that you will not need so it will instruct you to cut the unneeded pieces off yeah right maybe superman can cut that but this thing is made out of the hardest plastic imaginable what i did is took a lighter and melted the parts i needed to cut so they were soft and easy to cut it will stink like melting plastic but at least you will be able to cut it,146,61
3571,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,clockwork install flawless i have yard metra in the past and will use again,14,62
3572,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,another cheap mounting bracket you have to break off tabs to use,12,63
3573,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i got the job done it is plastic not metal,9,64
3574,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it is a double dinn what ever it is for,8,65
3575,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,way overpriced for three pieces of plastic that you have to cut up per instructions to fit your specific vehicle for this price i should have been able to select my specific vehicle and get exactly the mount that fit it instead i had to take a japan blade and cut off five of the six tabs specific to my vehicle also it comes with no mounting screws and neither did my new jensen receiver so now i have to order specific metric screws to make it work installing this new receiver has turned into a week long process,99,66
3576,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,the frame was usable for my 2006 gmc-envoy retrofit project but it took some engineering to cut off all the stuff that was in the way and not cut off too much and a minute later you regret it sounds simpler than it was in practice it came with documentation but it is very poor i understand the cost of printing a decent manual would be prohibitive but why not have higher-quality installation images on their website,78,67
3577,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this made installing the new boss head unit we got for christmas super easy the head unit would not have fit with out it,23,68
3578,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,works great with double din touchscreen reciever in my 2005 silverado,11,69
3579,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,although it said it would fit my year car it really did not so I am a bit disappointed but i managed to force fit it,24,70
3580,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,side mounts worked good with some hole modifications no mounting screws were included,13,71
3581,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,works great besides one side of the mounting bracket was cracked an it did not mount right,16,72
3582,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,excellent product fast shipping great seller highly recommended,8,73
3583,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,according to metra this should have fit my vehicle i bought this for a 2003 tahoe and it did not line up to the holes on the dash i destroyed it trying to make it work wasted money,38,74
3584,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,left a smallat top of stereo but holds it in place,13,75
3585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,instructions a little difficult but figured it out,8,76
3586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,was broken when i received it and made of very cheap plastic would definitely not recommend this just spend the money and get a better product,27,77
3587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,unfortunately thisdoes not comply to the iso double-din standard as well as one would hope the standard width is supposed to be 180 mm my head unit has a big screen in addition to knobs that go right up within 1/32 of theof the unit this metra harness does not fit over the knobs which are inside the overall profile they do not stick out so there has no way to get the bracket onto the head unit the head units listed width is 180 mm which comes out to about 7 3/32 inches i measured this kits internal window width to be about 6 13/16 close but no cigar it is worth noting that many american manufacturers modify the iso measurements to be 7 x 4 taking that into account 6 13/16 is not an egregious miscalculation likely an intentional decision to make the mount fit right up against the control interface of american-made head units which may have some black space around the edges with my japanese head units strict compliance to the iso standard and controls extending right up to thethere has just not room in this bracket just make sure that your head unit will fit in this bracket and you should be golden seems to be made of your standard hard plastic kinda close to abs but not quite and of solid quality manual provides lots of cars and different installation instructions which tabs to cut off for each one,244,78
3588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,just as the description said it would be cheaper that the stores too,13,79
3589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,slots where not aligned with stereo but it did a good job not bad at all,16,80
3590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,the quality was not the greatest and the fit could have been a little better mounting but it worked and looked ok oddball adjustments had to be rigged,27,81
3591,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,it fits perfect in my 2004 monte carlo a little cheap but it did the trick for my pioneer avh-4700bs,20,82
3592,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used this on a 2008 trailblazer and it fitted perfectly a little fragile so we are going to order another one but it is exactly what we wanted,27,83
3593,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this dash kit worked perfectly for our pioneer avhx-5700bhs in our 2005 chevrolet tahoe,14,84
3594,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,this fit and worked well it would be nice if it were aluminum or something more rigid but after install and trim reinstalled it looks factory,26,85
3595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used this on my 1995 buick roadmaster wagon to install a blaupunkt new jersey 220 double din yes you have to take a lot of tabs off but if you follow the instructions and use the stock radio as a guide it really works well i would recommend this to anyone with my car,53,86
3596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,i was happy that i even ordered the correct one for my car however i had to break almost every single tab on each side made me think why can not they just make different ones instead of one why should i pay for it and still have to do all the work it is like the last guy on the assembly line quit that day so this also would not stay clipped in on the side and left too much open space on the top and bottom thank god i have a heavy bag after installing with this,96,87
3597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,for the inexperienced may prove difficult to work with knowledge of what you can an can not do helps greatly,20,88
3598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this works like it should it is the double din install that turned out to be a nightmare do yourself a favor and cut the metal bracket behind the radio or your new radio will never fit kit or no kit i hesitated and tried everything and finally cut it and perfect looks so good,48,89
3599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,not cool says it fits a 2006 chevy crew it do not very very disappointed same on you guys waited to get it had everything removed ready to install and the dash will not fit tight so there is a,40,90
3600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,dis not fit with my 2007 buick rainer or the ssl touch screen,13,91
3601,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,bought this kit for my 2003 yukon and my 2004 avalanche and both had the same problems since the radios and dash are exactly the sameon the top and bezel can not lock since radio is not in the proper location i think the slots on the double din are cut wrong from left to right or the tabs were put wrong on the left and right plates i just decided to modify the side slots so the radio moves up putting it in the proper location because this is my 2nd kit and it has the same exact problem metra please look into this and let us know what you find i can add photos of problems and what i did to correct it if needed or wanted,130,92
3602,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,it is a multi-kit as such there has enough variability in it that it will probably work fine for your application a couple of items to keep in mind although first off after it is in it is secure enough just do not expect a rock-solid mounting typically the plastic has some give to it so you will have to persuade it into the position you need this can be a positive of course as that bit of flexibility will be what you will need to mount your unit squarely second the tabs are not pre-cut or scored since it is a multi-kit you will have to remove the majority of tabs that come on the brackets i used a plastic welder to just slice them off you will be fine using either a small saw or jigsaw just remember that you will not be able to just snap these off this is really what makes it better than most multi-kits I have used before if you want to get a higher level of quality you will have to get something application specific but for 95 of us this should be more than enough,181,93
3603,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,arrived earlier than expected and fits my 03 trailblazer perfectly,10,94
3604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,could be easier to install but it did work,9,95
3605,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,does not fit a double din radio sorry i could not give it less than 1 star,15,96
3606,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,low quality trim piece around radio will not work in my 2004 suburban,12,97
3607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,really good product am very happy thank you,8,98
3608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,the only drawback of this adapter is that they try to cover too many vehicles with one kit you end up cutting away 75 of the plastic to just use what mates up with your application it worked but could have been a little better if it were designed for my 1995 buick roadmaster exclusively,55,99
3609,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,you have to cut off pieces and the instructions are horrible before you cut off uneeded pieces get the radio out and really look at everything well you can not rely on the horrible instructions which only clearly show one side really stupid,42,100
3610,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this thing is a quick way to mount the stereo it is not bomb proof but does the trick,18,101
3611,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,worked perfectly with my toyota matrix 2004 the manual even includes instructions for toyota matrix and pontiac vibes 2003 and 2004 even although amazon displayed a message stating it does not fit a toyota matrix 2004,35,102
3612,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,it was nice and fit my 2005 hummer h2,9,103
3613,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,this kit fit my car just fine but it does not fit the stereo it says it is double din but it is not big enough for a double din unit to fit in it it took me a long time to get around to installing it and now i can not return it complete waste of money d,55,104
3614,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,worked as described wish there was not as much cutting of tabs involved,13,105
3615,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fit my pontiac sunfire 2005 perfect awesome price and fast shipping thanx amazon will recommend product metra makes quality aftermarket car stereo accessories,23,106
3616,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,was as expected needs some adjustments and plastic is fragile if you know anything about installing radios than this will work fine if you do not maybe want to get an extra backup because you ll probablly crack / break it,36,107
3617,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this kit was a pain in the but to install but once i got everything clipped of it worked great only reason i am giving it 3 stars is because the instructions told me to leave certain things on and then when i tried to put it in i had to clip like 6 more things off other then that it worked great,63,108
3618,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,for what it is it works it is plastic and has a little give to it if you need it just remember that it actually is made for many different vehicles in a wide year range so you will have to dremel / break off specific pieces of it to fit your vehicle i used it to install a radio for the first time after researching how to do it being a novice for audio installation it took me a little bit to figure out you actually had to break pieces off of it for it to work properly ah well that is my fault and not the product vehicle installed in was a 2001 chevy malibu,113,109
3619,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,metra makes kits for almost every make and model car out there this one was for a cadillac escalade and a pioneer avic-z build quality is good and installation was straightforward it really depends on the head unit and the car but the metra kits include everything you need to make it happen i used the screws that came from the factory hu so make sure you keep those if you are doing an aftermarket hu install you most definitely should use metra,83,110
3620,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fits perfect directions are simple and to the point spacers where needed for the radio to match up with the dash,21,111
3621,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,i used this kit to install a double din pioneer dvd player it worked perfectly i have installed about 10 different cd and dvd players in various cars and trucks this kit is great quality and the included instructions were well written highly recommended,44,112
3622,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,unless you really need a super universal adapter do not get this it says it will fit a 2004 envoy but it will also fit about a dozen other vehicles i had to cut off all the other fittings before it would fit in the mount hole although it did have the correct mounting tabs,54,113
3623,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this was used to install a double din radio in my 2002 chevy trailblazer i did not need 98 of the kit only parts i needed were the side tabs shown in the picture they bolt directly to my radio with no surround if i used the surround i would have had to cut up the factory fascia panel to accommodate that surround piece i decided against that and blacked out the metal mounting cage for the aftermarket radio instead amazon is the only way to go with this kit because the kit is dirt cheap buying in a store it can cost upwards of 2500 or more parts worked flawlessly,111,114
3624,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it does not work on 08 silverado it says 90 and up but only goes to early 07 model will not work on new body style,26,115
3625,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,it is ok but i broke it trying to install it a little flimsy and need need seven more words to finish this review but that is all i have to say,30,116
3626,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,well i accidentally ordered this one when i ordered the metra 70 - 1858 wiring harness for gm 88 - 2005 vehicles the wiring harness worked perfectly but this thing was a pain in the rear-end to get those tabs to break off i gave up and ended up ordering the metra 95 - 2001 instead and it worked perfectly,54,117
3627,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,i got it the same day i got my hu pretty darn fast i must say very easy to install only minor cutting needed to be done to get the fit on my car the only thing i did not like too much about it is that it feels kinda like flimsy plastic granted once in place the hu feels sturdy and does not move around but it did not feel as strong when i first opened it from the box still is not a bad buy if your looking for a cheap installation kit,92,118
3628,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,it was a perfect fit it made the install look clean very easy to install it was a sterdy unit,20,119
3629,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the plastic on this is very weak and one side broke when trying to screw it into my dash extremely poor quality you get what you pay for,28,120
3630,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,i purchased this because i surprised my wife with a new pioneer stereo / navigation system for her car clearly i need an after market install kit and this fit the bill it worked like a champ and did not break the bank,40,121
3631,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,bought this figuring it would work pretty good with the pioneer stereo i was putting wrong it did not fit in the hole right without breaking off the little wings on the sides to fill space it is not even big to fill the front space that gm has in the dash opening on the 2008 gmc sierra the mounting screw holes do not match up total waste should have measured,71,122
3632,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,you will pay twice as much for one of these kits at best buy to be honest this is not worth more than the 10 it is here on amazon it is just a few pieces of rather soft plastic i used this to install a jvc kwr500 into a chevy malibu 03 the directions are not the best i actually had to cut more of the plastic off than it shows in the manual for my install i cut off the plastic pieces i did not need but then i also took a dremel and smoothed down the areas where i had cut so nothing would catch the sides as i slid it into the dash for my install i did not need the front bezel if you get confused about what pieces to cut just take a look at your oem mounting pieces and see how they are aligned that should give you enough guidance to finish the job,155,123
3633,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i used this kit for installing a double dinin my 2005 chevy colorado since theis made for so many different vehicles you have to cut off the plastic tabs off for whatever other vehicles you are not using it for which kind of sucks and is confusing at first also the instructions are not the greatest i had to read them over several times to make sure i was doing the right thing so i did not screw something up also when i was screwing the bracket into my dash the plastic cracked from the pressure it did fit and get the job done but next time i would pay a little extra for a better kit,120,124
3634,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,the old saying that you get what you pay for is so true it did the job however took a lot of manipulation to get it to work and you have to break off the unused tabs and be very very carefull to not break off the ones that you do need,51,125
3635,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used this product to install pioneer avic z130 bt into a 2003 trailblazer the product provided the necessary side brackets for the mount i did have to remove two unused screw tabs as they were blocking my dash panel from going in i do not find this to be a defect when it works for so many different applications,59,126
3636,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,this installation kit worked out fine installing a pioneer avh-p4300dvd 7 in-dash double-din dvd av receiver with ipod / iphone control pandora head unit in my 2003 yukon xl denali only reason i did not give it five stars is the directions are a bit lacking they are definitely geared towards people who are already experienced installing stereos I have done about 15 in my life not the first timer the guide book leads you all over the book from one section to another and is not intuitive also the picture that shows you which tabs to remove for your vehicle is poor it is very difficult to tell in the small black and white drawing what is what in my case all but 2 or 3 of the tabs needed to be removed or cut off the side brackets it does not tell you how to do this but a set of wire cutters should do the trick they did not need to be perfectly flush in my case also one of the tabs was not needed but was not indicated for removal in fact the left bracket in the image only had two arrows but required about 8 or 9 tabs to be removed recommend you look at your dash before cutting and match their picture with what mounting holes you have available measure twice cut once,225,127
3637,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,i bought this after looking at the price of the scosche gm1590ab and the price of this at half the price i figured no big deal i just ordered the scosche model because this one broke during installaion the break-off tabs broke off do not waste your money get the scosche product and save your timescosche gm1590ab double din kit with trim ring / iso for 1992-up general motors,69,128
3638,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this kit has it all installed mine in a chevy van and it worked like a charm good quality bracket hardware and manual included shows youbydirections going to buy another one again,36,129
3639,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,i used this product to install a kenwood dnx6960 double-din head unit into a 2004 gmc sierra the instructions were easy to follow the product did it is job well and i now have a clean / professional installation in my truck update three weeks after installation i had to remove my head-unit to do some under dash work while doin so i noted that the tab used to secure the unit to the dash had broken off from the right-hand ear i had not forced or jostled anything I have revised this review from 5 stars to two because the product is apparently made of brittle / flimsy plastic il be replacing it with something else,110,130
3640,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,do not ever order from boxwave i have to return myand they are impossible to get in contact with they do not respond to emails not a company interested in making the consumer happy,34,0
3641,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,the white version of this product produces a white haze on pictures taken with flash due to the cutout design it does not integrate with built in iphone functions such as auto correct and tapping space bar twice for period it is a great conversation starter and it does provide a full screen for typing but once you try to use it it makes for harder typing the trade off is not worth it why thiswas on back order for 3 weeks is beyond me the folks at apple had it right the first time,97,1
3642,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,I have had an ipod touch since it is release in 2007 so I have grown quite accustomed to the on screen keyboard of apple products but after i had such a good experience with the bluetooth keyboard for the ipad2 i own the zagg / logitech brand one i thought this maybe a goodwhile i do not hate the product i can honestly say I am not entirely satisfied pros the most obvious pro about this is that it is a full physical keyboard if you type in landscape mode then you already know how much screen real estate you lose when you are typing making it difficult to see having the physical keyboard gives you back all that screen space so really if you are big on text messaging you are totally going to dig this product the battery life of it is actually really good and you can go for quite some time without having to charge the thing considering the keys are backlit while typing this is a plus cons the construction of this product is pretty brittle the keyboard itself is not flush with the assembly and feels like if you were too rough with it the keyboard would fly right off another gripe i have is the placement of the buttons while it is a complete qwerty keyboard the problem likes in the key placement after extensive use you will come to the realization that you are force to shift your thumbs more to the right i found myself making more mistakes than i would like because of this but it is easily overcome with time and patience overall it is a goodreally like i said i do not hate the product it just feels like it could have been done a little bit better,287,2
3643,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,it is a neatfor iphone users who would like a qwerty keyboard unfortunately the one deal breaker was that with this on the phone it no longer can be docked i have yet to use the charging cable my iphone came with as i have docks all over the place to conveniently charge it on however with this I had have to remove it each and every time toit which is not too easy also what another reviewer said about the flash is absolutely right even while taking pictures with qwerty open the picture still comes out unclear and hazy other than these two reasons it is pretty great just not great enough for me also i think it is a bit pricey maybe half the cost would be good say 25ish,129,3
3644,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this keyboard case is the reason i got an iphone however it feels a little flimsy and they should recall it because pictures do not turn out when you use the flash i believe this only happens with the white case and not the black one it does not automatically capitalize or spellcheck but if you must have a physical keyboard then this is the one i recommend,67,4
3645,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,after receiving this in the mail i must say it is not what i thought it was going to be you are basically paying 63 for a plastic case that prevents you from using your flash and has poor key quality the keyboard works fine but the backlight is constantly going away and the keys themselves are very tiny i do not think this was worth what i paid I had say it is worth about 15 i would not recommend this product sending back tomorrow,81,5
3646,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,we bought these for our new iphones 4s and they perform as advertised for someone who is making the transition from a blackberry or other device with a keyboard the keyboard buddy is a nice add on positives include nice backlit keypad good size keys and easy to use function keys downsides include additional size and weight drain on battery life for the iphone although not as bad as feared and fact that use of keyboard seems to disable the auto spell check function on the phone all in all a good device for someone who uses their phone for a lot of e-mails,104,6
3647,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,just received the case fits nicely a little bulky and takes a little getting used to pushing the keys as they are a little tight when taking flash photography it does not work i think this problem may only be related to the white case as it is flashing back the white surrounding the camera / flash i tested my theory by placing black tape along the inside around the camera / flash and my rudimentary solution at best worked somewhat could not get the tape to fit exactly the picture was actually visible so if you want the prettiness of just plain white you are stuck with just taking non-flash photography or take the phone out of the case whenever you want to take flash photography which is easier said than done could be nail breaking in my case it would be nice if the manufacturer had the option of black on white,149,7
3648,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,the product looked fantastic online but i was not as happy with what i got the box was a bit bashed although it did come 2 days before expected delivery date and therefore was very prompt overall I had say it works great but has a few kinks auto correct does not work when using this and it is annoying to type on it when using an app that will not turn sideways also mine has the problem that if i do not use it often after about 4 - 5 hours of non-use the bluetooth disconnects and i have to reconnect it so this means that every night obviously not texting in my sleep so it is not being used the bluetooth disconnects also this happens during the day if i am not constantly using it very annoying although it has some problems i am quite pleased with the product and have gotten numerous comments on it people wondering what phone i have in fact i received a comment the first night having it at a restaurant so my point is it is quite a good conversation starter i would recommend buying it but only if you are okay with the problems i have mentioned other than those it is a great case quite easy to type on and the backlight is nice,217,8
3649,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,the keyboard itself is great keys are nice to type on love the shortcut keys backlight is great for typing in the dark but the major problem is that the cutout for the camera and flash causes the flash to create a haze in all photos you take with the flash on if that did not happen then i would have kept it sending it back to amazon now,67,9
3650,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,a gift for my grandson which he requested he liked it that / s all i can say about it so don know what else you want,25,10
3651,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,i bought this for my boyfriend to use with his new iphone because he is has a passionate hatred for touch screens but these days that is pretty much the only kind of smartphone available i was pleasantly surprised with the quality and the look of this case it was not nearly as bulky or awkward as i had expected and i like the keyboard layout space bar centered instead of off to the side it was easy to pair it with the iphone and the backlighting is pretty cool and he really loved the feel of the buttons the fact that they were raised and had a rubberized coating but then when he started using it we both noticed a problem with the s key at first it just seemed a little sticky and added a ton of s s whenever he touched it example thankssssssssssssssssss then a few hours later it just stopped working entirely he has been trying to just work with it anyway in hopes that it will just kinda fix itself but it has not yet and so i will probably most likely be returning soon for 70 i expect all keys to be functional,196,11
3652,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,this keyboard was probably the best purchase for my iphone that I have ever made it worked wonderfully and the keyboard was just the right size for me i will say that if you have bigger fingers then this product might not be for you but it never wore out and i type a lot of texts messages during the day the backlighting worked great as well the only thing that was tricky was knowing when to plug the keyboard in to charge but it did last me about 2 - 3 days and that is with it constantly being on and used very impressed and happy with this product even although i do not have that phone anymore,114,12
3653,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,i give it a three as i have not yet purchased this case but have all intentions of it i also think that a lot of the complaints are unfairly placed people complain of keys sticking andstains and stuff like that they also say the bluetooth does not work well these people also say how they let there kids play with there phone or they take it to school so obviously it is going to get some wear and tear also if the keys stick it should fall under the warranty i have contacted no wave and they got back to me later that day they have decent customer service if you have a little patience if the bluetooth messes up try resetting your phone fully charging your phone and the case and then attempt to reconnect them a friend of mine owns one and that usually works thank you for reading,153,13
3654,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this is a decent keyboard case but fell low on my expectations firstly this case can get dirtied really easily on the back do not put it next to any pens pencils markers or crayons even with the slightest dot of those and it will be on there permanently no matter how much you clean it even with a hard soap scrub secondly the led backlighting is a fail the light is only supposed to shine through the keys but the plastic the keys are placed in is very thin so you can see the lights glowing through the plastic everywhere in weird places giving a bade effect another problem with the led backlighting is that you have to press a key to light it up temporarily a better way to have the lights turn on and off is to have a trigger when you slide the keyboard in an out the problem i have with the above issue is that when i am in a dark place let us say at night in bed i can not see the keys so i have to press them randomly to light it up and then delete those characters i pressed again i have to repeat this process every few seconds when i want to type and pause and gets very annoying overall the keys are good and the case looks very appealing and are responsive i like the integrated lock and home buttons in the keyboard too,244,14
3655,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,it does not feel great feel a bit flimsy the keyboard itself it feel like if it is gon na break cuz of no support the weight is all in the iphone right so when sliding it out it somehow is difficult to type / text with an ease prone to breaking i got it returned liked the concept need more work on it,61,15
3656,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,bought this for the wife after she switched to the iphone she had a keyboard on her previous phone and just did not like the iphone touch screen this predict was easy to install even for the technically challenged easy to use lighted keyboard and does not require recharging very often great product only negatives i can see is it adds weight and thickness to the phone,66,16
3657,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,first unit was bought new from online retailer unit worked as long as usb charging cable was attached once removed unit shut off battery defective unit replaced and similar problem battery charge only lasted a hour or so thinking the units that retailer had were bad one was ordered directly from boxwave via amazon that unit had intermittent working keys on the keyboard i would not recommend this product as 3 out of 3 were defective,76,17
3658,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,the keyboard would not work properly but that was not my problem with the product it was the actual company i contacted customer service and they did not get back to me till 4 days later they do not have a phone number to contact them they could not even see in their records that i had already sent their product back when they finally contacted me would never never order anything from boxwave ever again,71,18
3659,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,the virtual keyboard keys are a little to small for me and my smart phone makes me feel a little dumb you know always spelling a word before you can finish your sentence spell check is good and sometimes i need it but not with ever word the keyboard buddy allows me to text with ease it makes the phone a little thick i can live with that just what i needed,72,19
3660,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,since getting my iphone last may i have never repeat never been able to text an a without hitting the caps key and never been able to hit an m without deleting the previous letter everyone told me that i would get used to it and adjust so either i was defective or the phones keypad is not made for my size fingers size 8 gloves short nails having me believe that any man with much bigger hands and fingers would not have trouble with the iphone keyboard after searching for many alternatives the boxwave keyboard came into view and offered backlighting a decent sized space bar located in the middle of the keyboard and best of all raised keys so touch really comes back into play with texting the additional bulk has not deterred my from carrying my phone in carpenter jeans nor an already crowded purse and the bluetooth connected is great i recommend this for all iphone owners who look up to see that their text is not what they thought it was and is instead jibbery glibberish,181,20
3661,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,it neat and it works it does not have any awesome features but it is still pretty cool the keys are a bit small but it is what it is,28,21
3662,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i recently purchased this case from seller and it was brand new never been used the box was a little beat up but the case is beautiful and is easy to use i only have two problems with it after a week or so the case faded pretty fast and looks really dirty even after keeping it in a case the whole time the way the material is makes it hard to keep clean and now i do not even like to take it out of my pocket second thing i found is the p key does not work all that well after a week you have to press extra hard on it to get it to work if someone could tell me how to restore the material on the case i could live with the one defect of the keyboard,139,22
3663,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,it is supposed to be a keyboard but does not have a question mark also it is a little clucky than anyone would really like to be honest but it doesnts have a full keyboard,32,23
3664,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this case / keyboard works just fine everything functions well my only complaint is that it is difficult to hold / balance as the top where the phone is is so much heavier than where the keyboard is makes it uncomfortable to hold while typing functionality is fine i do not know how one would redesign this to fix this i have become accustomed to using siri so i do not have to type at all,71,24
3665,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i purchased the white backlit iphone keyboard case it worked well but was not worth the money it was very bulky and top heavy when i put my phone in my pocket my jeans stained it blue in areas,39,25
3666,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,not worth it wanted my new iphone to work as my old htc evo shift but it did not to bulky and i do not like the full touch screen very much i i phone is not all that bad,38,26
3667,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,i was thrilled with theof a regular keyboard against touch keyboard on my iphone it is a more comfortable way to type for me the addition of the keyboard adds a little bulk to the phone but is very comfortable and lower profile than the one my friend has from a year ago the problem i have with this product is that i have only been using it for 6 weeks and already the markings on the keyboard have rubbed off so now i can not see the functions of many of the keys it does not matter much on the letters but the symbols are gone and i have to guess and hunt for the right ones now not acceptable wear,122,27
3668,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,I have had this for about 5 months and i got to say it attracts a lot of attention from co-workers to complete stranger works great but can be a bit annoying from time to time it takes a while to get used to but once you do it all good i find it hard to get the phone out of the case although and the battery dies to quickly for my liking but overall a great product and highly recommended,79,28
3669,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,the keyboard setup was the only positive about thisotherwise it was to heavy and it would take forever to connect my phone was so heavy it was very odd to old and to put in my pocket,39,29
3670,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,i love having a full keyboard for my iphone 4s but there are a few changes i would like to see numbers / and sign you have to use fn button before and after numbers or and sign so it is no longer a shortcut to text b4 2morrow and more i would like to see a microphone key so siri could be accessed backlighting i do not think it is worth the extra money to buy backlit case it does not light up the keys so you can not type in the dark anyway camera flash i have used the flash with the keyboard closed and open and it works just fine for the 4s,109,30
3671,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,this is keyboard is the best thing since slice bread i know u guys know what i mean the backlight if the keys are perfect for being in the dark not like others the lovely keyboard is in the right place it is worth the money to me,47,31
3672,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,it was a cool case and made good conversation the white got dirty after 2 days and the usb charger port broke after a week because i barely hit it at the wrong angle on my desk I am returning it and getting my money back it was fun while it lasted,51,32
3673,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,i saw thison youtube and decided to buy it it is 60 bucks and for a otter box i pay around the same price so it was not a big deal i bought it without reading review and after i purchased it i started to read the reviews and the comments on it were not how do you say likable so my thoughts on it were a little shaky waiting on it it took 3 business days to arrive when it did i hooked it up it looks amazing it is really easy to use it took a while getting used to it but by the end of the night i had it down con about it really the only thing i noticed it is a little slippery the matte white is a tad bit slippery but other than that box wave did a good job if you like to be original and you like to have things that no one really has this is a way to stand out i love it,173,33
3674,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,thisis fine but the kyboard does not have a comfortable feel to it and it is hard to get to the top and side buttons on top of that the slide got loose within a week of having it now there is a smallbetween the case and keyboard and a slight wiggle if u do not hold the keyboard and phone at the same time i have the white one terribleliterally on the first day of puttin it in my holster it got thestuck on it and it will not come out for nothing I have tried everything not being able to clean it is the biggest issue for me I am almost fine with it feeling crappy but looking crappy just ruins the whole thing for me i would not recommend you not to buy it but i will say i could have saved the money or bought something else it is cool the first week of having it but after that it gets old dirty and old,172,34
3675,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,did anybody else have trouble with buttons not working my r t o p and k do not work this makes it very hard to type on,27,35
3676,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,i bought it about 4 months ago and I have only used it like 2 times it feels funny in your hand and the keys felt stuck it would turn off and on by itself and was just a waste of money,41,36
3677,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i love the case i got it yesterday and i there is nothing really about it that i do not like i just got to get used to where the keys are but the only flaw about it is my keyboard seems a little loose but besides that it is a great case and i would recomend it to everyone who wants a physical keyboard to use plus the backlite is very usefull in dark areas,73,37
3678,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,i tried using this keyboard for a good week before deeming that it was just too bulky and hard to get used to this case almost doubles the size of the iphone and the keys are not placed in the greatest positions also it tends to be glitchy when it comes to capitalizing letters i would try to capitalize letters with the keyboard buddy and it would turn off the capitalization on the iphone i would highly recommend against buying this product,83,38
3679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,i do not usually write bad reviews but if i can dissuade at least 1 person from buying this product then i will consider that a success heres why i used this product for 3 minutes and decided to return it immediately white finish is extremely prone to marks or stains got it is first stain within the first 3 minutes of having it no thank you not enough room for your thumb to easily access the top row of keys keys do not provide much tactile feedback have to press kind of hard to get the letters to register angle at which it holds the phone in relation to the keyboard is awkward almost like the phone is tilted back a little bit too much overall as some other reviewers have stated this keyboard does add some bulk to the phone i think this should be expected from an add-on keyboard such as this i would say that the added bulk was not an issue for me and if you are hesitant about buying this keyboard for that reason you should not let that consideration affect your purchase decision for the usability issues bulleted above i would rate thisas a do not buy unless there is some reason that you absolutely can not live without the physical keyboard other than that the iphones mediocre and free on-screen keyboard provides a much more friendly experience,238,39
3680,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,thisis not worth the 60 dollars it costs i was hoping to have an easier time typing however with most of the applications it does not turn it also drains you battery i had to charge my phone 5 to 6 times a day very unhappy sending theback,52,40
3681,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,after receiving this in the mail i must say it is not what i thought it was going to be you are basically paying 63 for a plastic case that prevents you from using your flash and has poor key quality the keyboard works fine but the backlight is constantly going away and the keys themselves are very tiny,56,41
3682,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i do love this keyboard a lot and i was so excited i got one-day shipping and it came on time the only bad thing about it is it adds a little bulk to your iphone connecting the bluetooth is very easy and quick i just do not like the thickness it adds to my phone I had recommend this to anyone who does not mind a little bulk,67,42
3683,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for a case with the slide out keyboard this is as good as it gets for now the case and keyboard are a bit bulky but they get the job done i find myself taking the case off when I am at work and only using it when at home,53,43
3684,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,the first impression i got from people was this is so cool however after carrying it for a few weeks it does not look white anymore white is very delicate then after a month i started having connectivity issues something the nuu minikey never had i had to keep resetting it with a pencil therefore overall it does the job but has a couple of ticks that might annoy you,69,44
3685,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,this is like the worst design ever it will make your phone super thick and look stupid the keys do not work well either it will sometimes type two letters in one press on the keys and the keys were not placed like a regular keybord instead all the keys were placed in stright lines this make the typing harder because you will always type at the wrong position the phone is really heavy and it is really hard to hold it and type when this thing is on it it just not look good at all do not waste your money,99,45
3686,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,wonderful keyboard overall but with minor issues using it to type this review and since I have owned a boxwave keyboard prior to using this one I am used to the keyboard layout added features lock button nothing too special about this for me since I am used too locking my phone after closing the keyboard one press function lock takes some time getting used to but better for typing number strings grips on f and j keys for more accurate typing pros finally backlit also has a button to turn of backlight for when you do not need it overall same keyboard layout some keys have moved but better overall for typing cons white model has issues with photography and flash considering painting the inside cutout black could have been tested for this issue white model can also get very dirty and cleaning can be an issue after two weeks the edges are browning due to the soft plastic material removed keyboard music controls one of my favorite features of the original has dissapeared overall great product i get comments about it all the time i love using it over apples touch keypad would have gone with black but my iphones white and they match quite nicely,210,46
3687,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,so i was really excited to get this keyboard for my iphone when i got it i put it on my phone and automatically noticed how hard it is to type it also gets dirty really easy too hard to type definetly not worth the price it is bein sold at,50,47
3688,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,great phone which has the comfort of a larger phone mixed with a very easy to use qwerty keyboard the keyboard has nice space and a texture that feels like the kindle with the touch of a button the qwerty turns into 1234 or ect just a need phone highly recommended,52,0
3689,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,the messaging features are nice typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard also the screen is quite pretty i have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature when receiving calls the phone works over half the time but it sometimes resets when i attempt to answer calls also at other times it lights up when a call is coming in but will not actually finish the process and start ringing so i do not know who actually called until they tell me later I am beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone and i suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up,122,1
3690,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,I have had this phone for a couple of months it is pretty cool in the way the screen and keypad can be used in either portrait or landscape however the keys do not have good tactile feedback i have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately it is voice recognition software is worthless so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial such as in the car using an earpiece do not bother the camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good the battery in this phone does not last near as long as my old lg however this phone has many more features so i think the battery life is acceptable it is got a sleek design and it is fun to use however i do not think I had buy another one because of the usability issues,149,2
3691,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,the real standout feature on this phone is keyboard i made the mistake of assuming that the mp3 bluetooth audio would be at least as good as my original lg chocolate from 3 years ago especially since verizon just copies it is old os onto everything the bluetooth stereo is almost unusable very tinny no way to adjust the sound profile if you plug a wire in it sounds great but not very useful phone call quality is ok it has a spot for upto 16 gb card which would be perfect if it was useful as an mp3 player if it was not too late to return it i would also the voice recognition is not accurate or useful something else that used to work flawlessly with my 3yr old chocolate,130,3
3692,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,calls are fine battery life is terrific compared to the lg phone i just discarded nearly identical software found on every other verizon phone I have had yet the standard issue ring tones on this one are pretty bad great camera however no support bluetooth file system profile nor support for marking multiple photos for push meaning that i have to push each picture painfully and slowly one by one to my pc via bluetooth so i should be done pushing the 100 or so pics i took today in about 28 days lovely also end key is right next to the space key if you inadvertently tap end while using the mobile web it exits no matter what / where you are and it is absolutely maddening while you are trying to learn the keypad layout time on the front display is permanently set to 12mode i do not think I am going to keep this one for long,156,4
3693,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,this is a excellent phone great talk time excellent standby very user friendly i may state it takes a little time to get use to but so does it when you change to new anything the only down fall is the top 3 keys when your texting when you have large fingers besides that i would recommend this phone to anybody my wife and kids go through phones like water so had many phones but this one is very unique exspecially with the flip screen the pictures are excellent minus not having a flash i can live with that because in low light still takes excellent pics the flashes on all other phones are a joke those are only good for a couple of foot so take how you want but i recommend this phone for anybody men or women is is very unique only gripe is for my wife could be in different colors but my gripe is 3 top buttons could be different thanks for reading jeff,169,5
3694,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,pros creative use of buttons big screen qwerty keyboard cons does not sync with outlook clunky user interface muddled audio in ear piece / speakerphone i really have to give credit to samsung because of the creatively designed keypad but i do not recommend this phone overall the phone user interface is not simple and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you are on for example there has an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm i guess I have been spoiled by almost always owning nokias as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces aside from the clumsy ui the biggest thing that killed this for our family was it is inability to sync contacts and calendar events with outlook maybe there has a way to do it with a combination of myverizon and usb cables but it is not worth the effort especially when i can switch to a nokia that takes care of it as an aside i switched to at t a week later because of the poor phone selection at verizon also verizon disables any bluetooth syncing capabilities with outlook even for the few nokias they offer overall the phone is designed creatively but it is hip design does not make up for it is poor ui and lack of features that were essential to me,231,6
3695,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,i got mine for free with the purchase of my wifes blackberry with the understanding that this is not a full computer it is a great tool tpo give you quick access to the internet i really do not like working on lap tops so only own a desktop this leaves me limited in where i can have access to the internet this thing gives me access everywhere i have wireless in the house and i use the broadband everywhere else because it is only a netbook it does have it is limitations if you are looking for a full featured machine this is not for you but for quick access to the internet and most files it is great,116,7
3696,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,overall i like the phone for it is call quality i love the keyboard and find it very easy to type text messages i have not used the camera or the bluetooth features i can access my email accounts easily the main problem with the phone is that locks up when i attempt to use the mp3 player i have an 8 gb microsd card with all of my music on it i hook the phone up to my car radio to play it everything was fine for the first month but now the phone locks up or freezes when it is in media mode and the only way to unlock it is to remove and then replace the battery very annoying the phone has also turned off several times when i was attempting to answer a call,134,8
3697,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,has some real ram issues it is really unusable it takes a good 3 minutes just to run a program i got mine for free for signing up for fios and i feel like i got ripped off i thought it would be a nice little thing because we only have 1 computer in my house but really this can be used for nothing more than a paper weight do not buy i had to give 1 star because 0 stars was not an option,84,9
3698,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,let me preface this review with a disclaimer i am not a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash i need a basic phone and want a few bells and whistles i replaced a basic lg cell phone with the alias2 on the recommendation of a friend i immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays although i swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page pros i love having dedicated keys for voicemail bluetooth and voice menus the rotating keypad is just too cool for words and although i do not send many texts i use the notepad all the time the qwerty keyboard is very easy to use even with fingernails it is nice to know i can check email and have internet access if necessary although i probably never will the camera is great and i like the editing options for pictures the screen size is generous and easy to see especially in landscape mode it is easy to use sound quality is good nice long life of battery charge cons the default backgrounds although those are easy enough to change some functions are difficult to find on the menus that is how i found the voicemail key could not find vm on a menu the ring is not loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket but I have never found a phone with a loud enough ring there has not a button on the outside that will light up the display to check the time you have to open the phoneyes there is it just takes a few seconds for the display to light duh this phone was a good choice for me and I am very happy with it,293,10
3699,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,i have been using this phone for a few days now and i like it i am not a big gadget phone fan preferring a simpler device that does just what i want the voice quality is acceptable and after a short learning cycle is easy to use the alias 2 allows me a novice texter to send and receive text messages with no real hassles the keypad is a great size even for my larger fingers i would have given 5 stars except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out not that this is bad but it is definitely different than the older phones i was used to,112,11
3700,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,my daughter and i both got the lg env2 about 8 months ago we are currently waiting for our third version of this both phones of our first phones failed within 5 months keys stopped working on outside dropped calls goes back to menu in middle of texting calls contacts at random times and much more we got new ones which were refurbished phones from verizon they lasted a few months before failing with similar problems plus now i have almost no volume even although it is maxed on the setting we are waiting for our next set of new phones to arrive later this week can not wait to see how long these last the upgrade to a different phone is not an option until you have been in the contract one year and can only upgrade one phone then,135,12
3701,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,i loved my samsung alias as most alias owners do i decided to purchase the alias 2 on faith assuming that samsung had simply updated certain features of the original i was mistaken the first thing you will notice is the size the alias 2 is taller thicker and wider than the original if you are like me one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it is super-slim design i would say it is about 50 bulkier than the original while the original slid into your jeans and disappeared the new one will stick out like a sore thumb i suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera / camcorder but i never used that feature too much in the first place ultimately i would say this is the reason i returned the alias 2 but i also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen when texting you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers / symbols / punctuation marks that you need in fact the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters the empty space is a theme on all screens in fact in either orientation as i said i found this annoying maybe only because i became so used to the 1000 figures / symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad i ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original i will keep my new every 2 discount until verizon comes out with a very good android or apple finally relents with the iphone / at t exclusivity,273,13
3702,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,this is probably the wrost experience i had with amazon and it costed me 7200 both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation i called at t and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company this process took about a week and not to mention the sim card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again,97,14
3703,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,i just got this phone a couple days ago and i am in love it works great texting is a breeze great size,23,15
3704,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,i love the e-ink technology the qwerty keyboard is great for texting but that is the highlight the huge drawback if you need to make calls with the bluetooth is that the voice activation system is useless my old phone worked flawelessly in this area but with the alias 2 if i say call john smith if it responds and many times it does not it will say did you say dial 123 or some other number or name that is nothing like the one I have said it is incredibly frustrating i do not want to look at my phone as i am driving that is why i rely on the voice activation / bluetooth to make my calls without voice activation working properly i am looking at my phone scrolling through my address book and just generally distracted instead of focusing on the road so disappointing,142,16
3705,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,when i first heard about this headset i thought wow they are really small i was looking for some external box to support the bluetooth but your seeing pretty much everything that is included in the package and pretty nice carrying case not shown all of the tech is stored in the ear buds and charging is done on one side of the ear plug a very small plug for ac adapter to plug in and charge the headset some reviews i had seen from other sites posted that the headset gets warm after extended use in my case it does not but i have not been using the headset beyond 3 hours of use the feeling in the ears is a little heavy then normal guys with larger canals will not notice much but those with smaller canals would find them a little uncomfortable one of the strange things about bluetooth and plugged ear phones of course is fidelity of the sound and when you wear these sony headset sealed in your ears you get some pretty decent sound not the typical high end fidelity you expect from most plugged ear sets i currently use the headset with my new iphone 3 g s and they work outstanding with a distance of about 20 feet from the iphone the audio for music and podcast is prefect for me the audio for the phone with the mic works perfectly with very little echoing on receivers end of course the biggest con in this review is the price I have managed to get the headset at about 149 but i think for the portability and flexibility for the bluetooth this is an excellent choice,280,0
3706,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,these ear buds are the greatest no more entanglement in the wires while working out or running great product for a great price definitely a must for athletes and everyone else,31,1
3707,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,this headphone is so perfect i use it while driving jogging and at the gym it is small compact and the sound clarity is great,24,2
3708,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,not a bad product hard to achieve connectivity not loud enough but it completely drowned out my professor so that makes it worth the price,24,3
3709,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,these are a great set of earbuds you can listen to music from your phone and make and receive calls with them i use it with my android phone but it works with anything with a bluetooth connection sound is great earbuds are light and stay in the ear it is great not to be tied to the phone while i tie up homeless people i would recommend them to anyone,70,4
3710,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i wanted to buy a light and stereo bluetooth headset i saw a lot and i tried many from my friend before i choose this it is not very loud and do not painful to the ear but the make me sad is the box was not contain the cylinder carry case,57,5
3711,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,used on an iphone sound is terrible earbud slip out volume is too low even when you turn up volume on the device turning it on and off is a pain i regret purchasing this and do not recommend it,40,6
3712,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i purchased this for use with iphone 4 and new macbook air pairing is easy and they sound great no they are not up to the quality of my wired seinheisser earbuds but they are better than any other wireless headsets that i have used pros great sound quality small and light cons wish they could pair with 2 devices at one time i would list battery life here but for the small size the battery life is about all i could expect,82,7
3713,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,pros ease of use and technology wise they are great / slick headphones phone calls are clear and the way it switches automatically from music to a call is great bluetooth discovery was a breeze to htc phone cons sound quality of music is awful music sounds like i am playing am music in a can there is no bass the earbuds that came with my old blackberry sound better i compared them what a disappointment i looked all around the headphones for a bass button or something that would help nothing please tell me if i missed it fit the buds do not fit in my ear securely i tried all the size adapters no good i stuffed them as deeply in my ears as possible for a secure fit and for some semblance of bass but it did not work when placed normally in my ears they fall out quickly who works out with these are ears shaped that differently keep or return return the sound is too terrible to tolerate and that stupid piece of paper was the first thing i cut off of these headphones so amazon better not give me grief when i go to return them what is that an accountants trick to make money on customers who obviously will cut it off,217,8
3714,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,the fit and form was great they did not swing while i wore them and were comfortable once i changed out to the correct size unfortunately i was planning on using this for my fitness routine after the third day of use the earbuds shorted out when sweat got into them i have no need for earbuds if i am not being active without being able to jog or work up a sweat these are not worth the money i will continue looking for a better pair,87,9
3715,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,please please do not buy this this is an awful built product after a week of owning it thestopped turning off it did not turn itself off after 10 minutes like the instruction it basically was on until it ran out of battery basically everyday i had to charge it before using it it took about 4 hours to fully charge it after 3 weeks of this it stopped charging i had to leave the country for a month when i came back it was able to charge again but when i tried turning it on it would not turn on as for the sound quality when it was working awful please do not buy this,113,10
3716,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,just got this headset and have been using it the last couple of days pros sound clarity is awesome i ride motorcycles and road bikes and have stellar sound clarity during both activities easy to use and configure works without having to fuss with it great product for price cons the clip and carrying case that come along are not very functional mic over sensitive and transfers slight background noise into converstaions overall recommend,74,11
3717,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,time listening time no more than 3 hours from macbook pro sound not bad not enough true bass no volume button,21,12
3718,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,super small light and great sound quality the sound quality rivals that of any ear buds i have ever used the battery seem to drain in about 3 to 35 hours but there are no bulky electronics these are literally ear buds without a dangling wire simply awesome,48,13
3719,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,i bought this1 week age and i have found something about it 1 if your want buy one of this you have to consider that this headset is bigger than normal 2 it is more easy to slip out my ears for example when you turn right or left a few times it may slip out other than that i like it completely it is what i am looking for one ear headset is wireless so my ipod watch does not have any line connection and i just want listen music when i am on the way to school and home 4 hours battery lifetime is enough for me,111,14
3720,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,this is a great product as far as sound and talking thru the microphone does what it is supposed to the form factor is great no other product that i could find that has what i needed a bluetooth headset with no extra dongle 2 ear pieces and a mic the problems are just what a consumer would expect should be able to charge via usb not proprietary charger and i do have some problems with the bluetooth profile my htc evo it gets confused with my car profile and i have to disconnect and unpair sometimes my ipod touch however is not an issue the last small knock is uptime i think I am just being greedy i can listen to music for about 5 - 6 hours that is actually great considering the battery seems to be in the earpiece but when i get phone calls it seems to drain it 10 times faster i can only get about 15 hours talk time with 15 music but again I am being greedy and want the headset to last all day in a perfect world overall i am pleased with the headset had it for a few weeks am a bit worried about durability the piece that comes off to charge is very delicate it seems but time will tell i am on the fence to recommend it to friends and family not sure if worth 100 but all that have tried it and seen it are amazed by it but the price is a bit offsetting to most,253,15
3721,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i felt compelled to write a review after researching and reading reviews of the hbh is800 the people having trouble with the sound on these are i-phone users i have a blackberry and these sound great no volume troubles i especially enjoy when watching movies it is like surround sound inside my head i followed the initial charge sequence for the first charge and now can watch two complete movies before i even think about recharging i have worn the motorola headphones and they feel bulky these are lightweight and i can hardly feel them they come with three sizes of ear buds the middle size is just right for me this also helps with the sound quality as i found out the small size fit a little loose and did not provide as much bass middle size was perfect easy to pair and great sound i am gald i bought these,151,16
3722,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,but as can be said about many things wait for the new one to come out these are not exactly that new to begin with so i doubt sony I shall give these another swing for awhile but these fall a bit short in some categories but not intolerably so for starters poor batter life 4 hours is not enough for people who utilize these buds for music more than phone calls cheap plastic backing stupid piece of paper voids waranty volume on some devices will not go as high as i like but i doubt any of you have a palm pre the back of the buds themselves right behind the silver metal part is where you charge them and there has a small plastic flap that flips open revealing the charging port now it is not the flap that breaks but rather one day after trying to unplug them i ended up ripping out all the insides intact with the plastic charging piece part of the plastic broke off but thanks to my lazyness i did not call sony but just jammed them back in and they work fine now on a more positive note the sound quality is superb and almost worth their value if they were not wireless assuming you got a good price I am no audiophile but my ears work great and they will surprise your average consumer who never bought a 100 pair of headphones their design is beautiful and is the most low profile pair of wireless buds out to date the above problems are like i said tolerable if your the positive type besides not much room to complain considering these are one of maybe 3 - 4 other decent bluetooth in ear options,287,17
3723,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,this is a very nice bluetooth headset but lacks a few features it has no volume control and worse i can not control my volume from my phone htc hd2 so I am stuck with the same volume all the time battery life is not good lasts you a little more than 3 hours while listing to music that alone for me was the deal breaker i listen to 5 hours easily the headphones are kinda big which begs the question why many other bluetooth headsets are capable of holding 6 to 8 hour charges on smaller form factors like i said the headphones are big they will not fit inside your ear as you would hope so because the outside portion of the headphones are soo big that you can never really put it inside completely the cord is strong a clip is included the case is very nice but a little tiresome to keep using it has a microphone and an action button the microphone was well received by my callers they never had a problem hearing me all in all it was good product but it needed to improve on battery life and form factor i returned it and got the sony ericsson mw600 which is really the best bluetooth headset available i wrote a review there as well,220,18
3724,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,the product worked fine for a year-and-a-month right after warranty expired it stopped working did not expect that from an expensive sony product note that i still like it so much that i bought another one,36,19
3725,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i just got mine they r unbeleavable i love them i use them on my i pod touch i can not controll the voulme on them but when i get my i pod touch updated to the 40 soft ware i will b able to even now the voulme is just right and feels good while wering them nice job sony erricson,62,20
3726,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,it is a decent headset and works pretty godo with iphone ios4 prior to ios4 the iphone bt stack would not support the phone correctly there are two big problems with this headset although 1 battery life and standby are pretty awful done plan to get even half a day of music and talk do not plan to leave it in your car and hook up in the morning the charger is annoyingly proprietary what did you expect it is a sony product so you need to haul it around if you want to use this for more then calls 2 the little shirt clip that keeps it from falling off your neck yeah if you loose that you are sol you will loose this headset for sure and sony style and sony ericksin parts will run you around point fingers at each other but nobody will sell you a replacement some folks have managed to beg or bully a free one but this is just utterly screwed up and tremendously annoying as a customer it shows just a utter contempt for customers and their hard earned money oh sony right,188,21
3727,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,these headphones are absolutely wonderful but they do suffer from one major flaw they break very easily i have read other users reviews that state that the headphones quit working after a month or so that has been my experience with them as well i am on my third pair sony ericsson has been fairly good with the customer service and replacing the items although the 3rd pair took a little effort on my part to get them to send me my replacement headphones they sound fantastic are comfortable and absolutely pleasurable to wear these are the smallest of all bluetooth headphones be aware that these do not have a volume control on them so the volume has to be adjusted through your phone or mp3 player so be aware i had a bb tour and an older i-phone that you could not adjust the volume via the phone ultimately i would love to give these 5 stars but due to their fragile state i have to give them 3 stars due to their lack of durability,176,22
3728,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,I have been looking for a bluetooth headset that is comfortable attractive not too bulky and sounds good fortunately for me the sony ericsson hbh-is8000 headset fits the bill I have been using these for a week and they have been great so far i will say that i was a little initially disappointed with the quality when i tested them out of the box i heard a ton of static and popping on a couple of different devices however i believe this was related to a low battery as it was shipped from the store after i charged it for 8hrs as the documentation suggests i have not had a single problem with static the earbuds are slightly more bulky than the skull candy wired earbuds i own although they do not feel any heavier once they are in your ear I have worn them inside my motorcycle helmet without problem they were a little difficult to get into the helmet but once they were seated they were fine audio quality was not affected in any way the sound quality is great for a bluetooh device you will find that it is a little light on the bass response but not so much that it is very noticeable i did not really purchase these for making calls but in several tests audio quality was pretty good on both ends of the call one tip make sure you use the included clip if you expect to have the headphones hanging around your neck for any duration even after a couple of minutes hanging on my neck not in my ears the headphones started to slip off my neck overall I have been very pleased with the headphones and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys earbuds but prefers going wireless,288,23
3729,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,i already had another stereo headset from sonyericsson but it didtn met my expectations sound was bad and it was not as wireless as i wanted with this it is totally different yeah the sound quality is not the best but it is very portable if you will to sacrifice a little bit of sound quality with mobility and say goodbye to wires i think for the moment this is a pretty good option ah and for ipod touch 4 g you now can control the volume from the ipod,87,24
3730,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i use the headset while working out at the gym and love how no wires get in the way also watch the videos on my i touch while on the treadmill sound could be better but still good and blocks out background noise great,44,25
3731,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,I have had other bluetooth stereo headphones from sony motorola and plantronics the diminutive size sets these headphones apart at the gym these are great headphones because there is so little to hang from you or move around there is a small clip that also comes in the box that allows you to attach them to your shirt yes there are not any controls on these but i find that i can not operate controls on a headset when i workout anyway the only real downside i found is that these do not do as well blocking external sounds my plantronics bud earphones blocked more,101,26
3732,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,i love these except for the volume control the other thing is when i listen to movies on my itouch there is a short delay 1 sec syncing with the mouth saying the words,34,27
3733,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,this product is fantastic great sound for a headset decent battery life blocks environmental noise well great to use while driving one significant overall complaint customer spport for this product is atrocious good luck figuring out how to use it where to buy additional chargers and more three specific issues 1 it can only pair to one device at a time and must be deleted then re-added if you decide to pair it to an alternative device for example i use it with both my blackberry and my computer but have to add device each time i switch between the two 2 the system for charging the device is ridiculous the proprietary charger is yet another cord that needs to be toted around at least a converter from usb to the ericsson fastplug or whatever should be offered / provided 3 the bluetooth signal drops out relatively easily when you are not indoors no carrying the blackberry in the back pocket and expecting to use the headset if you are running with these expect to hold your blackberry in your hand,172,28
3734,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,i have been using these for about a year the audio quality is on par with other bluetooth headphones since they are incredibly small the battery life is awful they do not stay in my ears very well regardless of which size buds i use there are no music controls on the headphones but i had no problem controlling the music directly on my droid or mbw150 watch these are not worth the price they would best be suited for short-term ie bus-ride stationary not exercising use,86,29
3735,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,there is no control whatsoever with these headphones none i should not have to be some kind of techhie geek who knows all the ins and outs of avrcp software nor should i have to search and read through discussion boards to find out what should be basic info provided by the manufacturer sony should state explicitly that these headphones do not work with the iphone period,67,30
3736,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i have to admit the sound is not as great as a wired headphone but it is the sacrifice you make for convenience and portability i still think it is the best sounding bluetooth headphone to date i love the discreetness of the headphone people can not even tell you have headphones on i was able to pair with my moto droid with no problems pros no wires best sounding bluetooth headphone in my opinion very discreet high quality unit owned almost a year still works great and i use it about 5x / wk does not work great with iphones i hate anything apple makes especially the iphone cons sound could be a bit louder you need to charge everyday it last for about 2 - 25 hrs of straight listening bit pricey,127,31
3737,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i have a blackberry curve 8900 and i could not be more pleased with this purchase although only a week old not sure i understand the complaints about lack of volume control on the headset why add something that adds bulk i use my phone for work all day and now i take it to the gym for music great workout headphones i was worried with all the poor reviews but i think my needs are different from the people who do not like these i experienced none of the ear heating problem and I have had them in for 3 hours straight before the battery died,104,32
3738,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,tiny tangle-free audio sound quality satisfactory very good for bluetooth phone sound quality microphone sound quality microphone insusceptible to wind perfect for bicycle use no usb charger cable rather short battery time,40,33
3739,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,this is a bluetooth headset that will not illicit looks of contempt or scorn the unit is discreet but sexy and the sound quality is excellent the noise cancelling feature is very effective and is a potential safety issue if you plan to use these outdoors there is only one controll button on the unit that will pause playback answer calls and power on / off the unit i have found the battery life to be fairly short and the microphone is incredibly sensitive so background noise can be a problem with devices that do not allow for configuring mic sensitivity simply put this is an exceptional product but it is not without it is shortcommings apple users should also note compatibility issues with the controll format of this unit if you are like me and want the bleedingof tech this is the solution,143,34
3740,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,this pairs well with my xv6900 the sound quality is clear but completely lacking in bass mp3s sound terrible through these,21,35
3741,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,i purchased these headphones to use as workout head phones the price is kind of high but the concept no dongles or tangled cords while running seemed perfect i have purchased a few sony ericsson blue tooth head phone accessories in the past and was satisfied with all of them out of the box i had no problem charging and syncing the headphones with my blackberry bold all seemed fine as i put them on but soon after moving around with them i discovered that the ear tips did not stay in my ears i tried all three tips with no success as i shoveled snow in my driveway i spent more time and energy placing the ear tips back in my ear every few minutes than shoveling forget about running with these too you can twist an ankle while fumbling with the tips falling out i checked online and neither sony nor any third party vendors have any alternative tips it is really a shame because these headphones have a lot of potential if sony is going to charge over a hundred dollars for these head phones they should provide better ear tips for them in my opinion flanged or foam tips would be perfect as many others have noted you can not control the volume or music playback with these headphones but that was not a problem for me,228,36
3742,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,sony just misses the mark on this headset it could have been a five star product if they gave this product all the features i consider standard for a wireless headset i used this headset with an iphone 3gs and i wanted something i could use while working out taking phone calls was not important to me first off the positive features perfect size i can honestly say they are the same size as wired in-ear headphones great sound nice loud and clear no skipping or static it also comes with a nice carrying case and a collar clip so you can hang it off your neck without worrying it will slip off paired very easily sounded fine on the few phone calls i did make next up the negatives you can not control the volume or skip tracks from the headset a device designed for listening to music wirelessly does not allow you to control it it would make more sense if the left the phone control button off and only included controls for volume and tracks as other reviews have mentioned these features are controlled using your phone / music player however the iphone does not allow you to control the volume at all which is a big disappointment for iphone users hopefully the next version of this product will have built in music controls i would also like them to use a standard charging adapter like micro usb instead of the proprietary one that comes with this headset with those changes this would easily be a five star product,257,37
3743,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,nice looking small and light weight average sound and over-priced you can not adjust the volume from a ipod touch or iphone this is a big big minus i do not recommend thisthere are better choices out there,39,38
3744,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,replaced my 2nd jawbone with these on my iphone 3gs people i spoke to on the phone said it was clear but did say there was a lot more background compared to the jawbone expected given lack of noise cancellation sounds quality was good when it was not cutting out however the big problem is that it cut out about once per minute for about two seconds or so have tried other headphones with this phone and they work fine so the problem appears with this headset when switching the iphone back to using the phone instead of the headphones the headphones then blare a loud audio hiss as opposed to just cutting off jawbone did not do this lack of volume control was not an issue for me as the iphones volume was able to control the audio level just fine the design is good light weight low profile small problem with the mic being close to your collar in that it would rub against your shirt causing some noise not sure about battery life returning these before i made it through the first charge so all in all 1 star due to the constant cutting out,199,39
3745,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,does not hold a charge for long have to charge it the night before i need it no volume control the automatic adjustment works ok but would be nice if i could set it,34,40
3746,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,pro decent battery life easy to carry good sound music quality and also the person on the other end is able to hear me clearly that is mic is also very good con no volume control on the set itself my ipod classic volume control does not seem to be working when i pair it with this it gets stuck to shirt or coat collar when you turn pairing it the first time is a little cumbersome i liked the product but somehow my expectation was little more from this,94,41
3747,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,are these headphones perfect no but they have incredible sound and light small high quality and are probably the best option for stereo bluetooth headphones note these do work with my iphone 3gs took a bit of turning on and off to get the iphone to see them but once it did things went perfectly also note with the iphone volume is set at a fixed level on these every other bluetoothi have works perfectly and has variable volume with these headphones but i think the volume level is just right anyway not too loud and not too soft if you intend to use these with the iphone take note of the above issue which really is not a problem for me but with all other stereo bluetooth capable devices this should work fine sound is excellent considering these are wireless headphones quality is first rate manual could be a bit better as i had to play around for a few minutes to get the iphone to see the headphones and the charging indicator lights are on one of the earphones almost unnoticeable unless you know where to look this is not mentioned in the manual and it took me a bit to figure it out once i got these setup they sounded great it is a great thing to be wireless with high sound quality i can leave my phone o the desk and walk around the office and still have full connection to my music audiobooks and phone calls awesome device highly recommend,257,42
3748,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,despite complaints about the lack of volume control i decided to get it because of it is portability I am no audiophile but sound was decent although it seemed treble and high frequencies were lacking in detail obviously at the same price wired headphones beat this in sound quality my shures sound much better as an iphone user the lack of volume control makes this purchase a little disappointing however i think it should be noted that both sides se and apple are at fault apple should update the iphone os already and give us avrcp already it is disappointing when most of the phones in it is class can control volume while the iphone can not i do not think such low scores from iphone users are justified and are being unfair se should have given us volume control but how they would integrate that while keeping it slim i have noanother drawback is the proprietary charging interface since it is battery does not last that long 2 hours according to the manual i expect i would have to carry the charger everywhere i go it would be much easier to carry one charger for my laptop and use mini usb to charge the headphones overall I am happy with my purchase I had recommend it to people who have avrcp-enabled devices 11/15/10 update it is kind of late but you can control volume on your phone now you can only play / pause with the button on the headphones although still wish it can charge via mini usb,249,43
3749,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,concept was great but tad heavy in the ears would not stay on also it does not work with the iphone-my ears were almost blasted off when i tried them i am frankly shocked that s / e would make such a cool headset and not have it work with many phones especially the iphone it may work well for other devices i can not determine the possibility,64,44
3750,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,ow turn it off it is a piece of c is pretty much what i said when i tried it on i am now deaf in my left ear due to lack of volume control and an expectation that my iphones control would quickly turn it down nope I am in disbelief that anyone would make a product these days that is not specifically iphone compatible you silly kids,66,45
3751,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,i love theof the hbh-is800 small lightweight unobtrusive i was very excited to try the hbh-is800 with my iphone but after working with it for a couple of days I am disappointed overall i feel there are far too many drawbacks or limitations with the hbh-is800 and they make it a poor choice for a bluetooth stereo headset in my opinion 1 price 120 is far too much to pay for the limited features sound and voice quality 2 compatibility the hbh-is800 is not 100 compatible with the iphone 3 g 3gs and os 3x the iphones volume control does not work when playing music over the hbh-is800 due to the incompatibility 3 audio mediocre i noticed flutter and hiss when playing music with sharp highs silences and pauses such as classical pieces too much hiss for acoustic guitar weak bass response 4 microphone definitely not a noise reducing mic people i was talking to had a hard time hearing me the background noise from my end was very loud voice echo was very pronounced voice-dialing did not work well due to the poor mic quality 5 features on-headset controls are virtually non-existent no volume control no mute no forward reverse skip for music playback,208,46
3752,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,2.0,negative,bought these looking for smallest bluetooth headphones i could find I am very disappointed in the performance for the price there is no volume control when paired with iphone 3gs or 3 g have both when paired with iphone the music skips which is quite possibly the most annoying thing ever you can stop the skipping by turning the iphone to airplane mode great no calls emails texts nothing comes through there is also an audible buzzing noise when playing music again very annoying i only still use them because they are small and convenient when working out that is it i do not need or expect audiophile sound quality from bluetooth but this is unacceptable do not buy if you value anything except size and style,120,47
3753,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,great product a few minor issues hold it back from being a 5 star perfect headset the value of the headset is on par with the price but some may still find it too expensive currently there are not many other headsets similar to this pros very small ultraportable easy to use and versatile standard sound quality for in-ear headphones functions as headphones and a headset / mic pairs easily with imac and sony erricson cellphone comfortable suitable to wear for long periods of time cons mostly minor issues no volume control on the actual device just a multifunctional button used for on / off pause / play and hang up / pick up call battery time is lower than advertised about 3 - 5 hours not meant for extremely rough usage may not stay in your ears if used while jogging or playing sports,135,48
3754,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,this is the most convenient bluetooth headset i have ever used it is compact has good sound and is comfortable in the ears the microphone gives ok sound judging from the people i have spoken with over the phone but and this is a big but the user can not control the playback volume everything is played at full volume ok for audiobooks but annoying and maybe even dangerous for music which can not be played at full volume continually and sony has amazingly stated that it knows this to be the case if so then why release the headset without a prominent warning,102,49
3755,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,the sound quality is great compared to other blue-tooth headsets but not better than a cord earphone obviously sometimes i use this with my ipod touch yeah u can not adjust the sounds but for me the sounds is tolerable it is loud but not to the point that it I shall kill your eardrums,52,50
3756,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,i like the headphones and the quality of sound is good the problem is it will not work with the palm pre it works for phone calls but not with music not sure if it is sonys or palms fault but it needs to be resolved,45,51
3757,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,i was very excited to get this product but i was very disappointed first you can not adjust the volume on iphone it is pretty loud and then most importantly when i listen to my iphone using these ear piece the music keeps on getting interrupted i can not listen to one single song without the music get interrupted i thought i found my perfect ear set because it is so small and portable in the gym but now it is going back to amazon I am going to look for an alternative,87,52
3758,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,1.0,negative,ok this did work for the phone but absolutely not for listening to music i did investigate before buying but everything siad you need to use the volume control on the phone i have a se w350 phone and it paired easily used it on the phone and volume control works on the walkman it only plays at full volume no adjustment called se support and they did not have a clue until they did more research then they told me there is no volume control for the music full run around from support or lack thereof i called them one more time and asked them of all the phones on their website that they show compatability with which one can control the music volume the answer from them was none not one of the phones will control music volume on the headset it is automatic only and on mine that is full volume only enough to blow the hair off your head just wasted my time and money false advertiseing is what i say do not get stung like i did,180,53
3759,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,do not throw away your other bluetooth device just yet while this is a nice unit it does not last long as described by the products manufacturer 25 hrs other bluetooth devices usually last about 65 hrs of talk time standby time is good and comparable to other units music sounds great however the distance one can put between the device and the phone is not comparable to regular bluetooth devices for that reason this device gets 4/5 stars,77,54
3760,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,these sonys are lightweight and comfortable if they work with your phone or mp3 player they are unobtrusive as to be almost invisible unfortunately these do not work well with the iphone 3gs or the palm pre the iphone can not control volume which is ear-splitting loud the volume control disappears and pressing on the volume buttons does nothing the palm pre does control the volume and it works well with the phone but the music does not play too bad because they are nice and lightweight,85,55
3761,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with this headset great style simplicity and decent sound paired easily with my iphone 3gs no i can not control the volume but that is apples fault not sonys it looks cool is comfortable and is literally the smallest stereo bluetooth headset around it comes with a simple but elegant case and 3 sizes of earbuds as well as a collar clip to keep the cord from moving highly recommended,73,56
4088,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,product as promised cord was shorter than i wanted but the ad text did not specify a length,17,0
4089,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,i got this for my ipod itouch but looks like it will not plug in all the way for it to work with the mic i have a ipod 5th gen it works in it to record with the mic i wish some one said this her for me before i bought it i wanted it for itouch but at lest it works with my ipod but with the ipod 5th gen you do not need any mic plugged in it has one built in it all ready so it is only good for a external mic raymond day,97,1
4090,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,i just got this mic and i love it it is made of very good quality plastic i use it with my ipod touch and skype free internet calls over wifi for this small amount of money you can not beat the savings you get with using this thing i am very pleased with the call quality over all and it does not affect the sound through my headset in the least bit when I am listening to music i use it with a phillips over the ear headset and if i lose it i will not be sad because this has the best price out there i got it for 399 i could just get more I have been telling everyone to get one for their ipod and skype,126,2
4091,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,when this adapter is used with iphone 1 g and ipod earphone the calling party hear their own voice as an echo-really loud hence my voice is usually mixed up and unheard to the caller i stopped using it and got a griffin adapter,44,3
4092,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,it is kind of tedious to use this with headphones you end up having a very long cable in which the microphone is pretty far away from you unless you make a funny little loop on yourself i would partially suggest this although you actually get to use your own headphones the cable does not seem to because any interference in sound quality between directly connecting to my iphone 3 g than with the cable it seems to do exactly as i says just be weary you will have an awkward cable and that is almost enough to not buy it,96,4
4093,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,i received the adapter microphone and it was just wrapped in cellophane there were no instructions as to the reason for the button on the microphone the microphone seem to function as expected,33,5
4094,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,for those of us that have an iphone and hate the apple included ear buds this thing is your answer it allows you to use whatever headphones you want to use the sound quality is good for such a device at least that is what folks I have called have said I am surprised there are not more things like this out there,59,6
4095,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied with this product it is packaging and especially the cost well done thansk a lot for this,20,7
4096,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,powerful wonderful easy pushes you for creativity powerful wonderful easy pushes you for creativity powerful wonderful easy pushes you for creativity,21,8
4097,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,the mic is a little fiddly and does not come with operating instructions overall it is ok for the money and useful to make an existing pair of headphones handsfree,28,9
4098,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,the adapter did not stay in securely and there was always static the microphone hung too low for me and the excess cord was not comfortable i did not like this product and would not recommend it at all,39,10
4099,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,nice price quick shipping sometimes a person gets burned on discount products not so with this worked great for presentation and heard everything loud and clear have not used it long but hoping that it will last,36,11
4100,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,i bought two of these one for me one for my friend when i opened the first one to try it out it recorded but you could not hear through the headphones no the headphones were not broken i tried the second pair the microphone and the headphones that were plugged into the 35 mm hole worked so it seems to me like it is a 50 chance of them working or not there is a constant problem although with the second one where you have to unplug and replug the jack because it will start echoing the playback through the recording I am assuming there is overlapping wires or something,107,12
4101,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,this actually worked quite well the audio quality was very good i used it to hook up a pair of high-end sennheiser closed headphones at my desk so i could use them for doing voip conference calls on my computer it worked well for about a year rarely ever even being moved from laying on my desk in front of me where it could pick up my voice finally when i moved it once it literally fell apart i suppose i could try to glue it back together but that seems a bit tricky so I shall probably just buy another pair so bottom line is that this works nicely but it is not put together very well,115,13
4102,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,i have found that that the wired headsets for my iphone have a very short life 1 to 6 months and my best sound comes from a set of earphones i got to listen to my ipod an adapter seemed to be the best solution good sound and i can answer my phone without pulling the plug i need the headset because I am moving around the only problem i have had with these is that the plug does not stay seated in the outlet and i lose the sound from one ear that is a strange sensation I am not exactly a really active person and most of the time that is not a problem now that I have figured out where the sound has gone it is important to check all the connection points before you start switching out head sets when the disconnect happens this is only for switching from listening to talking the volume control is on the phone given that longevity was the issue i started with i think it is important to note that I have only had this a week or so i should check back if i reach the year mark also for the protection of the earphones it would be nice if the clip were a little stronger an easy tug loosens it from clothing,217,14
4103,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,i bought a very good set of ear phones some time back and i broke the clip holding the audio microphone and so the music worked as usual but i could not use them to talk on the iphone and more i was pleased to find this inexpensive audio adapter on amazon and it works as the old did i would rate it higher except i have to turn the plug once in awhile as it looses connection i would buy it again to save these ear plugs,87,15
4104,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,lost my shure mpa along with my shure 530 earphones bought this to work with my new shure 535s microphone works ok but there is a noticeable deterioration in sound quality when listening to music with the mike plugged in problem seems to be in the male plug which crackles a lot when twisted / rotated in iphone female plug which indicates poor connectivity conductance in plug there was no loss of sound quality with my old shure mpa so unless you do not care about sound quality you will need to unplug it every time you want to listen to music which defeats my purposes of use i bought it so i could listen to quality music at the gym which is why i bought the se 535s then take a phone call without having to unplug my earphones in my opinion a simple thin gold coating on both plugs would have greatly helped this problem,155,16
4105,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,it has great functionality the mic button can be used to control music on the ipod touch but this product does not last long,22,17
4106,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,i own an iphone 3gs bought this so i can use headphones of choice while having microphone capabilities static breaking up no one could carry on a conversation with me maybe it just works better on some headsets than others for me unusable good part was it did not cost much can not anyone invent one of these devices that actually works as advertised,63,18
4107,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,i was hopeful that this would allow me to use my phone hands-free in the car the product worked fine but the first one fell apart after a few months i bought a second one and it fell apart almost immediately heres how they fell apart the case with the microphone and the headphone jack simply came unglued after trying to piece it back together i was willing to throw a little glue on it the microphone ceased to work useless i wish someone would make a sturdy reasonable one of these devices,93,19
4108,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,it does work just not very well the microphone is not sensitive enough and voice clarity is terrible also the cord is too short to allow anything but shirt pocket carrying of your ipod or iphone all in all not what i would consider a good purchase,47,20
4109,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,i bought a htc freestyle and was told that it would let normal headphones connect to it while that was sort of true it was only mono output this is not 1960 i expect stereo output for any mp3 player in any device built in the past decade that the htc that was released in february 2011 did not produce stereo output bothered me but i bought this product it is not expensive and gave it a try voila all of my mp3 songs on my phone now play in stereo just like they should i have not tried the microphone yet but just the ability to hook up a normal stereo mini-headphone jack makes me jacked up great addition to the htc if you have a mp3 capable phone that plays only in mono with headphones try this out it solved my problem perfectly,142,21
4110,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,1 the wire near the jack broke off within a couple of weeks and the adapter became useless 2 while it worked iphone 4 did not consistently respond to the play / stop button sometimes it will work fine sometimes clicks on the button had no effect until i unplugged and the plugged in the jack again then it worked for some time 3 i have sennheiser ie7 headphones which unfortunately does not have the mic and ipod controls I had gladly pay up to 30 for the mic extension that works and does not break but was unable to find anything worthwhile so far if you know of any good adapters please leave a comment thank you,111,22
4111,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,i have an ipod touch 2 gen and this has enabled me to use it as a internet phone at the right price,26,23
4112,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,i bought a few of this because the price is pretty good to start with and i seem to misplace my cables all of the time i am now using one with my ultrasone hf1 - 15 g headphones and it works great the microphone is well placed and my voice is well heard when communicating with my iphone 3 g which it controls very well no deterioration of the sound when listening to music i did remove one star from my original rating because the cable connection to the microphone attachment seems a bit flimsy,92,24
4113,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,i bought this to use with my iphone 3gs it does not work as a microphone it does not control music play back it does not start voice control if you hold the button it does not answer calls if you click the button it obviously does not have volume control which i knew ahead of time so basically thisdoes nothing I shall test it out on an iphone 4 but as far as i am concerned thisis falsely advertised,83,25
4114,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,pros the sound quality of the recordings and skype calls on my 2 g ipod touch is great nice and clear the button on the cord is used as a play / pause button for the music and it works great the pass-through sound to my headphones is good quality as well no degradation that i notice cons the cord is short just under 24 which means you will need to keep you device close to you when using the mic when you add the length of a typical headphone cord 6 feet that puts the mic in somewhat of an awkward position either you have a wad of cord and your device in your shirt pocket or you must talk to you belly button when i plugged in my headset the case for the adapter split open at the seam like it had not been properly fused or glued together a couple of drops of superglue took care of it for under 2 bucks i will not complain takeaway i might buy a few more for the other ipods in the house and maybe experiment with splicing the microphone into a headphone cord closer to a usable position,194,26
4115,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,I am using this product with my shure noise reducing earbuds shure se115-k sound isolating earphones with dynamic microspeaker ii black and an iphone 4 the great part is that the shure earbuds have a removeable cord by removing the lower longer cord and then plugging the shorter earbud cord into the adapter it avoids the hassle of having a too long cord now i have great earbuds that work perfectly for making calls and listening to music on my iphone,81,27
4116,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,it worked till it broke into two pieces the mic broke into two halfs and tried to fix it but no luck,22,28
4117,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,for us mobile phone users who have always wished we could use an inexpensive standard over-the-head stereo headset for hands-free application i can not say enough good about thisany 35 mm stereo headset or listen-only ear-bud set can be converted into a hands-free by plugging it into the female end of this adapter thus converting the listen-only device into a good quality mobile phone headset with microphone and disconnect button this is of course practicable only for telephones that have a 35 mm hands-free jack it works very well with my i-phone and i am delighted to be able to use any inexpensive over-the-head headset with my mobile instead of the irritating ear buds which so easily dislodge from the ears during use the only problem i have with this adapter is that the cord length is perhaps a bit too short placing the microphone closer to the telephone than is practical in most applications nevertheless this adapter is a great innovation even in it is present form and i use it frequently with my i-phone while driving and in the house or while walking at this price i bought several this testimonial is freely provided by a satisfied customer comments welcome wayne warmack rogers arkansas,204,29
4118,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,i was disappointed that the length of this thing is too short for my needs it is about 1 11 almost long enough to have your phone in your pocket and clip the mic on your shirt collar but not quite you might be able to hold your phone in your lap while driving with the mic clipped on you shirt collar but you would not have any extra length to set the phone beside you in the seat or anything other than that it seems to work fine i bought this for my android incredible phone the mic needs to be close to your mouth to pick up but does so well and block outside noise i just know if I shall use it much because i can not put my phone anywhere but my shirt pocket while using it,138,30
4119,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,so far this adapter works pretty well i tried it with an older pair of headphones first and by older i mean something i found in my closet from the early 90s and i could not get the pause button to work but it works great with other headphones so a good buy in my opinion,55,31
4120,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,nice little product mic button can pause and play the songs pressing the button for long time opens voice control wish it could feature a volume control it would be just perfect then i would definitely recommend this to anybody who owns ipod touch,44,32
4121,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,purchased this for use with an iphone 4 and shure se in-ear headphones since most of the alternatives for a microphone extension cable are pretty expensive i figured a light user such as myself should be ok with something more affordable read cheap unfortunately upon first use of thisthe following happened 1 top connector where you plug your headphones was crackling horribly as if contacts were loose or oxidated 2 the third time literally i pressed the button to answer the call the button recessed inside the unit and would not come out did not answer the call wrote to the vendor within one day of the purchase describing what happened and asked for resolution never heard back i would have used zero stars for the rating but i guess one is the minimum i strongly recommend that you stay away from this joke of a product felt like throwing money to the garbage,156,33
4122,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,was not what was pictured and with in a few days it just fell apart,15,34
4123,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,thiswas shipped to me in short order and in new condition it worked 100 compatibly with my device i could not ask for anything more,26,35
4124,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,worked very well for about a week at most then the volume suddenly got very weak and would no longer work i noticed the wire coming loose so i tried unsnapping the case to maybe fix it but the parts are not worth putting back together i used to repair electronic equipment and so I am used to fixing things but i know when something is not worth wasting time with and this is one of those items if you have one be very gentle with it i thought i was but i mean baby the sucker if you do not have one pay a little more and get something better,109,36
4125,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,this worked well the first few times i used it after about a week of use one of the channels stopped working i had to wiggle the jack around to get it working this was fine since i was using it in a stationary position however after about a month after wiggling the jack too much the whole thing came apart the device is constructed with cheap materials and is snapped poorly into place so if you are thinking of getting one of these for mobile use you might think again i just ordered a monster isonitalk as a replacement for this let us see how that works,106,37
4126,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,hi everyone is the 2nd time i bought this product is worth it bought 2 because with the time and use the join of the cable and the plug connector could damage and sometimes you can not hear through the earphones but so depend of the use you do yourself for that i bought 2 beside that works awesome with my iphone,60,38
4127,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,it works only thing i wish is the cable can be a lot shorter the mute button with ipod does not always work well ipod most of the time mistaken it with song play command instead of mic mute a hassle when you are in a call and want to mute but ipod plays a song instead,57,39
4128,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,this product is great if you want a cheap piece of junk to last you for a couple weeks i used it and thought it was quite convenient i liked the play / pause button and the mic worked fine one day i was pulling it out of my pocket and the entire faceplate fell off and exposed the innards to my eyes it was seriously something i could have put together in a matter of seconds i am an amateur electrician so i put it back together and it worked fine until the headphone jack shorted out i attempted to fix this but the jack was impossible to find a replacement for without making wires stick out of the casing so now i can only hear out of one ear when using the headphones through the mic specifics pros low price nice small microphone works very well with my ipod touch cons weak construction terrible product quality i would suggest that you try paying a bit more for another product before buying this one,169,40
4129,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,i use my phone as my music player for my car and when i have my car plugged into the headphone jack on my phone it disables the phones mic so i wanted to get this to solve that problem i also wanted to get this so that i would not have to hold the phone while driving turns out this will not work with my phone i guess if i had a smart phone instead of a dumb phone it would work with it oh well it was cheap so it is not that big of a deal,96,41
4130,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,i bought this product because it was supposed to be able to give me a microphone for my itouch and allow me to plug in my headphones at the same time the microphone works as long as i do not have headphones plugged into it after reading the other reviews it looks like i got a bad unit i would not order it again,63,42
4131,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,the adapter fits fine into my iphone 2 g and sounds normal compared to direct headphone effect but the mic volume is too low as complained by the receivers which makes it half baked for me,36,43
4132,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,the product worked well for a few months but by this point the wire connection at the male end is frayed and exposed if i move my iphone around a little i can fool the unit into thinking that the wire noise is a hold button press not bad but I am going to buy a sturdier one when this one breaks in the next few days,66,44
4133,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,this works very well with my ipod touch 3rd generation 32 gb audio seems clear from the microphone and the adapter does not cause a noticeable drop in quality on my headphones ksc-75,31,45
4263,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,product is well-made design is a bit clunky but best of all is that i no longer have to remove my 3gs from it is case when charging,27,0
4264,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,this is an excellent charging stand for an iphone it works with the phone still in the case the design is clean and simple i have tried several charging stands and this is the best,35,1
4265,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i needed a nice docking station for my iphone 3gs and this seemed like a good match i use one of nutshells leather belt clip cases so i was not worried about any potential case issues thelooks great very sleek and metal not plastic although it does have rubber pads to keep it from damaging your desk i took the included cable and hooked it up you have to pop out the cable holder on the stand slide your cable in and then lock it in place with the holder they are very emphatic about you not using the apple cable which has the locking clips since you want to be able to slide your iphone or ipod touch on and off without worrying about such clips at first my phone would not plug in problem ended up being that the cable is labeled backwards the connector symbol which is normally on the front of the cable connector needs to be on the back i have the black unit so i do not know if this is limited to the black cable or to any of the cables anyway that was easy to figure out and fix my iphone sits in there without any issues and is able to sync data and charge happy customer update 12/22/2010 fyi I have been using this samewith my iphone 4 for the past 5 months or so without any problems,237,2
4266,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,works as advertised hence the 3 stars however a few things really really bug me 1 the iphone sticks up higher than I had like I had like the connector to be recessed a little bit lower 2 the silver is not what it looks like in the amazon photos sitting next to my alum macbook pro and my alum keyboard this cradle looks more like cheap silver spray paint it is brighter and more reflective it is almost enough to return it if it were not for the fact that it works well I had recommend getting black or anotherif you think the silver should match your other apple products,106,3
4267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the product looks good online and in pictures but when you get it to your desk and put together you see that it is not as space age as it looks the cradle consists of a big hunk of metal and a separate cable you must plug in well it is claims that it fits any iphone even with a case on is a flat out lie i have an iphone 3gs with a incase plastic she shall case the connector that holds the usb connection cable is too big and blocks the iphone from fully seating into it is spot and connecting to charge or sync do not buy this if you have a case on your ipod touch or iphone,118,4
4268,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,all things considered this is a very nicethe finish is well done and the quality of the basic construction is first rate there are rubber inserts at the back that protect your phone from scratches there is a rubber strip on the bottom that keeps thefrom scratching the surface it is sitting on and also keeps thefrom sliding when you mount your phone they include two rubber or silicone pieces for the back of thethat fall off when they are installed the cable insert is clever but sloppy not a tight fit to theand the connector does not fit my phone with the case on the cable end itself fits but the insert it slides into is too wide with just a couple tweeks from the manufacturer this will be a five star,144,5
4269,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,now with the included cable i think this is a really good value over the previous model it looks good improves the sound and does what i need it to do gives me a bedside stand that most importantly works without having to remove my case what more can i say it is a squiggly piece of aluminum alright it comes with some removable rubber feet i presume for non-slip and to protect the surface you put it on and they can come off easily and be lost maybe they should throw in an extra pair just in case update for what it is worth as i worried would be the case i did indeed lose the rubber feet that came with this but after contacting the manufacturer they were kind enough to send out 2 sets of replacements i applied a drop of krazy glue kg58548r instant krazy glue all purpose tube 007-ounce to each and have not had a problem since update 2/3/12 upgraded to a 4s with a marware sport she shall convertible case for iphone 4 black fits at t iphone and I am now going to have to find an alternative as the case is not compatible with this cradle afraid the case is more important to me,211,6
4270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,this looks great in the picture but it sucks plug is not the standard size you see on your regular cord which it should be that is how you are able to get it plugged in to phone with the case on it you have remove your protective case every time you put it in this charger a lot of cases out there are a pain to do that on a daily or several times a day to put on this charger and not putting the cases down but they work great to protect sucks sucks sucks,97,7
4271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,works perfect with my itouch you can attach it either to a power source or to your computer for syncing,20,8
4272,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,received on time bit flimsily to pop on but works great,11,9
4273,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,okay stand but no provision for securing the player to the stand and the connector retention in the stand is flaky and will not hold i had to drill a small hole beside the main connector to allow a speaker jack to connect external speakers,45,10
4274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,nice to have a sit-in charger for the iphone but the plug should be longer to be able to use with any type of case on the phone i am using an extension but it make the whole thing real unstable,41,11
4275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,i have one of these charging an old ipod on my desk and really like it i could not find a desk charger for my lg f3 so i bought another one of these and just pushed a micro usb cable through where the dopey apple connector is supposed to go already a nice snug fit for the micro usb and then superglued it in place I have been using it like this for a few weeks and it works great konnet should get their act together make some minor mods and start selling these things as android docks,97,12
4276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,very cheap and little stoppers keep falling off every time i moved it to read the phone the charger only worked once and then never charged phone again very cheap returned,34,13
4277,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,this is a great charging stand for your i phone because i have a case on my phone i can not use it without removing the case because the case blocks the charger cord because of the type chargers on all i phones up through the i phone 4 series that issue will not change if you have a protective case on the i phone,64,14
4278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,arrived with the docking cable loose could not be reseated so i sent it back for a refund nice looking stand but build quality is lacking,26,15
4279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the connector is flimsy and can not properly attach to the stand so the phone wobbly and it would not except the phone cover thoughtless design useless product,27,16
4280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,i have the silver version and it is not aluminum like an apple product it is painted silver and it is obvious theoverall is very cheap quality I am using it for an ipod touch 4 g and it wobbles around a bit the connecting hardware is not attached to the stand very solidly plus there is not a lot to support your device making it difficult to use the touch screen while docked basically it does the job but i would just go with the apple universalwere i to do it again,92,17
4281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,stays charged and i can see it fine i even text while it is in the charger i wish it had an easy way to plug into the pc i could do this permanently but i have it plugged into the wall i can pull out a white cable and plug it into pc but it will not be on my charger but I am always at 100 when i leave for the day,72,18
4282,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,so easy to pop my phone on for recharging i have one for my bedroom and one in another part of the house even my guests have used them,29,19
4283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,this is my 2nd try unit does not work will not charge iphone5 pressing hard into the connector does not work either too bad i had one for my iphone4 and it worked great,35,20
4284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,received my unit today and found it to be fine at first when i plugged in my iphone it did not seem to charge it but when i pressed down on my phone it did provide power while i have not done this procedure again i would advise that if yours does not seem to work to do what i did and make sure it is seated properly for the price which includes a lightning cable i do not think you can go wrong so far i am pleased with my purchase,89,21
4285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,this does what i need it to do although i do have to be thoughtful as to how i place my phone on the charger the base tends to loosen and the cord falls out,35,22
4286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,while the need for anlike this is great and the design is sleek this model is cheaply made does not hold many phone cases and has plastic parts that break easily,32,23
4287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the angle makes it impossible to mount the phone with a case on it it is impractical to use since you have to take the case off to charge,29,24
4288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,had to return thiswill not work will with element cases that my family uses on iphones looks good from a distance but when you get close the workmanship is poor and the connectors never seemed to stay in place pass on this one,45,25
4289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,nicely finished and pretty but good luck trying to slip the phone on in the dark nothing guides the phone down over the plug so it is a bit painful to use I had rather just plug the phone in and lay it down when buying a cradle i want it to be something i can easily drop the phone into this is not it,62,26
4290,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,looks modern but will not fit i phone if you have a thick cover case they should redesign the mounting after owning this for several months now the cheap plastic connector mount to the phone broke off it looks great but i would not buy this product again,48,27
4291,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,built solid rubber bumpers keep falling off for the cost they could have designed it a little more rigid yaa think,21,28
4292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,i love the look of it but it is very cheaply made for the price the thing falls apart all the time the cord is always coming out of the clip on the bottom,33,29
4293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,when i opened the package for this konnet cradle the rubbler inserts immediately fell out the plastic piece that anchored the charging cord would not keep the adapter head properly seated in the cradle so i had to go out and buy some crazy glue and added a drop on each side of the plastic piece it worked the plastic piece now held the adapter head in place so now i am excited to try synching my ipod touch only when i plugged into the usb into my laptop port it shut my laptop down completely not once but everytime i rebooted and tried again it crashed everytime i might have been okay with it by swapping out the cord and using my own ipod cord but since i glued the plastic piece in place i could not get it out do not waste your money as i said i threw it out konnet technology kn-8268 icrado plus metal metallic charging chargercradle stand kit with charge and sync cable for iphone 4s 4 3gs 3 g and ipod touch nano 1 pack reatil packaging black,196,30
4294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,thisjust arrived and i have to say i love it i have purchased other cradles and this one is perfect for me my iphone fits perfectly even with my outer case on it i can easily remove the phone as well,42,31
4295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the connector is flimsy and can not properly attach to the metal stand so the phone is all wobbly tried glueing the connector in but there has nothing really for it to stick to so it fell off again thoughtless design useless product,41,32
4296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the metal base is well made however the good news ends there the connection site and arrangement of the plug is cheap and flimsy and does not stand up to daily use the base is not heavy enough so two hands needed when disconnecting i had purchased this product to use in conjunction with the apple iphone bumper a fairly standard accessory but the plug arrangement does not allow for this the colour is also not true to pictures the one i received was more like a pastel metallic green i would have returned this product but international shipping costs made it not worth my while it now sits empty beside my computer as a reminder of internet shopping folly disappointed,122,33
4297,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,if you have a case for your iphone beware the connector will not seat fully with ours not sure what brand our case is just make sure you understand the risk if you use a case,37,34
4298,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,it will not fit with any iphone or ipod touch with a case on it which is very useless if i need to take off the case then why i need a stand to charge the phone and also the connector lock is very lose i even need to put something to tight it up and finally i cut of the side of it original top in order to put my phone in charging position don buy unless you don have a iphone case or slim case,86,35
4299,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,thisfor the iphone is just what the doctor ordered small sturdy stylish works right out of the box of course i have no case for my iphone so i have no issues with the connector not fitting perfectly as some people have mentioned well worth the money in my view,52,36
4300,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,description states that it will work with an iphone in a protective case but it will not even a thin ifrogz case prevents the phone from connecting to the charge / sync cable,31,37
4301,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,crap pure crap the usb cord that comes with product works for a month and then no return policy waste of money do not buy,25,38
4302,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,i recently bought thismainly for my iphone 4s theis made of a nice aluminum just like the imac the bought the black one i am currently using an otterbox communter case with my iphone 4s since this docks connector is so close to the back end and does not come up too much it is impossible to make this work for my case now without a case it works perfectly fine so if you are trying to buy thiskeep in mind alot of cases simular to the otterbox commuter series case will not work with this docking station you might want to check out the konnet icrado neo that one is a better buy in my own opinion,123,39
4303,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the packaging was nice but the part that holds the power cord in is just a cheap plastic clip that does not stay locked in place for the money this purchase was a major disappointment do not buy thisand waste your money like i did in addition amazon has started outsourcing shipping to cheaper companies to save money i received this package from prestige shipping it was delivered by a guy and his daughter in a black unmarked dodge caravan at 800pm i paid for next day shipping and that is what my money bought bye bye amazon,99,40
4304,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,the quality on this is better than i had expected it has a nice solid metal feel to it and looks really sharp the included cable charges and syncs an iphone 4 no problem it comes with rubber feet that you clip on to the back but they do not look like they will stay on very well if i move thearound and one thing that would be nice is if theconnector had a looser fit so that i could just lift my phone off the cradle without having to hold down the,96,41
4305,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,basically i thought it would work with the case that i had on it like the description said i was pretty bummed out when i got it and it did not fit the function that it was meant for,38,42
4306,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,i bought a couple of these got xmas gifts and one is broken already nicebut very cheaply made i would not suggest this for anyone that likes quality,30,43
4307,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,I have had it for 2 years now i think it is been used almost daily at work exclusively with headphones works very well it is stylish and stable uses little space and does what it says i invested in a radio shack inline headphone volume control i paid about 6 so i can have easy volume control for my headphones the volume control should have been part of the cradle but well problem solved i ding it one star for not thinking about how a user will control volume,86,44
4308,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,my husband wanted a way to charge his iphone3 on his desk while keeping it upright to view while working this konnetdoes exactly that the sleek design and great orangeare a bonus to the functionality i expected thisto be wobbly especially side to side but it is remarkably solid the phone itself is a bit wobbly side to side while docked but only noticeable if you grab it or bump it hard just touching the screen it stays in place just fine docking the phone is not as easy as just dropping it on there but it is easier than picking up the standard charging cable and attaching it you just position it properly and push down the little white non-skid plastic pieces that go on the back of the bottom come right off i do not understand why they are not tighter we added a small dab of rubber cement to keep them in place that did the trick he has a case by magpull it is a hard case but quite slim the phone does fit on thiswhile in the case the orangeis not traffic cone orange it is darker than the picture online appears it has a deeper richer undertone with a metallic finish overall does what i needed it to at a decent price,228,45
4309,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,i ordered this to have connected to my work laptop to charge my iphone and ipod works really great and i like how sturdy the stand is it also looks really nice my only problem is that sometimes the cable inside gets a little lose / crooked but it is really no big deal,51,46
4310,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,this cradle just does not work the small plastic bumpers that are designed to provide a gentle rest for the back of iphone constantly fall out I have already lost two of them that have been swept away or vacuumed up plugging the phone in is a nightmare as it shifts on the cradle it starts and stops charging on it is own and often fails to charge overnight as a result do not even bother to contact konnet directly their customer service is based in hong kong and takes a long time to respond and does not offer any resolution when they do respond very disappointing I am already looking for a replacement cradle,109,47
4311,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,updated the otterbox defender is to thick for this charger the slope of the back starts way to early this is a great looking design good for the otterbox cover and any other cover that allows direct contact to the metal around the idevice however the plastic clip does make me nervous about the clip just breaking through the hole in the metal if you have a case of cover that blocks you from seeing the metal around the idevice charging port [ ] then you will need aextender to leave the case on most cases / bumpers have a small plastic or rubber cover around the charging port that only allows some charging cords to make the connection viable if your case allows you to see the charging port and around the charging port metal then you should love this charger otherwise find aextender or grind the plastic insert down to allow the connection to be completed once you plug the wire into the plastic holder it is blocked on both ends shortening the male end about 1/16 of an inch so if you have anything blocking the top of the plastic clip from making direct contact with your idevice the male end does not seed deep enough to actually charge the phone you need a good extender for this to work,223,48
4312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,thislooks very nice on a desk and functions well enough my only complaint is that theconnector comes loose too easily it is only held in place by a plastic clip that will come loose under fairly light pressure the entireconnector assembly is fairly loose there is a rubber ring that seems to be there to stabilize theconnector but it also comes loose easily despite that i am still happy with the product,80,49
4313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,theis cool but when my iphone is plugged in it does not touch the backrest and just kinda floats so if you are trying to type on it while it is in the stand the phone flaps back and forth and is annoying also the silveris very metallic looking and does not actually match the brushed aluminum look of mac products,61,50
4314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,I have been using it for a while with my iphone 3 g no case with no complaints i just got a 4s and put an incipio cover on it it is a pretty slim cover it fits but you have to wiggle the phone a bit to get a connection it looks nice but is a bit pricey,56,51
4315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,i got this tomy wifes 3gs and while the quality is hefty enough and includes a cable it does not seat in her phone in an otterbox defender or commuter series it also does not seat in my 4s with a defender series point is it seems like a good solution if you have a small case or none but not a good one for the bulkier cases,70,52
4316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,great for night stand or at work desk price is high for what it is but looks nice if lower price i may recommend other to buy it,28,53
4317,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,may not work on a phone in a case but with the case bottom off it works great it is a nice stable platform for the phone while it is on the charge it was very timely in delivery,39,54
4318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,the charginglooks very nice on my desk and matches my mac where the pug connects to the phone is a bit loose but will not fall off or hurt the phone in anyway over all it does the job good buy,43,55
4319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i bought thisto use with my iphone 4 for charging and downloading pictures it works very well the connector sticks up high enough to engage the receptacle through the otterbox case it also works well just as a stand when i do not need to charge or download i bought the black version which also came with a black usb cable the fit and finish ofand cable is excellent i plan on ordering a second one,79,56
4320,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the bottom connector seems a bit too loose and when it sinks in a bit well the device you are plugging in does not reliableseems to worked a bit better with the iphone 3gs rather than the iphone 4 perhaps the connector specs has just changed enough without any side guidance like a universalhaving it drop right in is not quite so easy simple docking of course is the entire point perhaps an example of nice looks but not so user friendly so looks good has some mechanical issues which may or may not hit ya so buyer beware,103,57
4321,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,works as advertised i am happy with the purchase the phone works with most covers if i had to ding the product then it would be over the connector at the base where the phone connects the connector is a little loose and could have been made a little better,50,58
4322,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,this unit is very pleasing to the eye and u knew going into the purchase it is limitations if you do not have an issue removing it from a protective case then it is great i thought i would not have a problem doing that but it is a little frustrating,49,59
4323,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,ok the product works however i ordered black and it was deep green with speckles they do not even offer thiswhich tells me someone mixed up the paint code but they still sold it hmmmm so i painted it right myself next before i decided to paint thethose black grommets kept falling out so i took them out before painting and re-glued them back into place after the paint was dried same with the plastic piece for holding the wire in place need to glue that or it will push down and your iphone / ipod will not make 100 connection i wrote the company but no response i wanted to order another one but i wanted to make sure i did not have same problems they never responded all-in-all the docking station works with a little hidden glue however it was not worth the high price,149,60
4324,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,i have an iphone4 and my wife has an iphone3gs and we both have the otterbox defender case bought two of these chargers and shipping was fast upon receipt secured the cable connector to the stand with the plastic latch which is not very sturdy really not sure just how durable this will be the iphone 4 will plug into the connector but the phone sits straight up in the stand because the back bottomof the phone case makes contact with the charging stand preventing it from leaning back which means all the phones weight is on the phones charging connector and the iphone 3gss case prevents the phone from plugging in at all guess this is the chance you take when shopping online nothing like actually being able to go to a store and checking out anbefore buying it to be sure it is indeed what the seller claims it to be,156,61
4325,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,theis very cheap and not worth 30 the icrado plus claims that you can plug in any ipod / iphone with or without a case this is not true for any case i tried i tested with an iphone 4 g with an iskin solo case and no luck i also tried an ipod touch 4 g with a small case and also no luck theconnector attachment is too fat to fit into the hole in the case then if you remove the case andthe iphone it does not sit back against the bumpers on the back and has all the weight balanced on theconnector the metal is so lightweight that it slides on the desk easily and does not feel solid when docking your device the plastic clip that holds the cable in place is also very flimsy and cheap the only good thing about thiswas the black usb cable that comes with it right now that is the only part of thei am using still searching for a decentfor iphone 4 with a case,186,62
4326,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,i have used thisfor a few years without problems with an itouch it worked fine for the itouch did not have problems with the docking or undocking i have replaced the itouch with a verizon iphone 4 and this cradle does not work with the iphone in or out of it is case the problem lies in the very small lip between the end of the cable and were it goes into the iphone it is only about 1/16th of an inch but it does not allow the cable to insert flush to the iphone if i take the cable out of the holder it works fine and the cable inserts flush into the phone i have tinkered with it quite a bit and i am not able to get the verizon iphone to charge in the holder,139,63
4327,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,the unit is well made and the connection method is well thought out the issue i had was that the removable plastic sleeve that holds the charging cord was preventing my iphone 4 from connecting i removed the sleeve filed it down a bit and all was well no big deal but really should have been caught during mfging qa over all a good product,65,64
4328,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,i have looked at and tried a number of simple charging stations for ipods this one is great because you can leave on practically any cover you may have and there is no interference to thesimple and affordable,40,65
4329,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,love the look was missing one of the rubber bumpers but i was able to contact the manufacturer and they sent me a full set of replacement pieces after i sent them some photos,34,66
4330,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with thisit is stylish and works excellent with my iphone 4 i have not has any issues up to this point as a matter of fact my phone seem to get better reception now this probably has nothing to do withbut the fact that the phone is upright instead of laying flat on my desk i am not using the rubber guards for my iphone 4 i am using sonix snap slim case for iphone 4 with 2 screen protectors which i am pleased with,91,67
4331,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,got this because of the cool colors and states that it will work with case on however although it does work with my wifes otterbox case it does not work with my seidio innocase it appears that the connector is a little too fat to fit inside the case what a bummer,52,68
4332,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,thishas to be the best made for use with the ipod / iphone line no matter what slight design changes are made or what case you have it will still fit securely in theplus it is damn sexy looking,42,69
4333,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,this stylish piece of rubbish will not fit an iphone 3gs in an otter case and it is cheaply made while being over-priced 3 strikes 1 star too bad i can not give it zero stars,34,70
4334,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,thisis awesome it is design will not scratch any surfaces it touches your device could be placed with a case on it i myself have a very large case on my iphone3gs and it works awesomely 2 problems both very simple and just silly in general 1 the little rubber things on the back can be removed and it is annoying to put them back on although it is just as hard to get them off 2there is a little rubber ring that goes on the top side of the whole for the cable this rubber ring is very annoying because it looks horrible after it is moved because you can not move it back to fit the way they give it to you 2 is vague but i gusse you will know what i mean if you get it,138,71
4335,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,thisworked wonderfully and looked great while it was in one piece after three months and one slip off of the desk what I am left with is a piece of metal and an iphone charging cord,37,72
4336,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the appearance is positive beyond that it does not work when inserting the phone the connector falls off tried using my own connector plug same problem the supplied rubber feet fall off whenever you move thein sum a stylish piece of expensive metal that does not serve it is purpose do not buy,52,73
4337,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,this might have worked for me but the ipodcable that came with it was defective it did not work at all with or without theadditionally the system for attaching thecable to the doc was defective the cable would not stay securely attached when attempting to put the ipod / iphone onto theit would push the cable out i ultimately returned it and got the genuine apple doc which works fine but require your remove any case you might have on the ipod / iphone,88,74
4338,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,the 3 feared words some assembly required if you able to get it assembled correctly it still does not hold the phone correctly the best thing you can do with this is to take the cable out of the piece of metal and lay the phone on your desk,48,75
4339,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,at least not without some modification the cable that comes with it fits in the bumper case just fine so if you want to be able toyour phone without removing the bumper you need to grind out the bracket that holds the cable until the opening is large enough for the cable end to stick through it then you need to glue it in place with the cable end sticking out about 1/16 of an inch once you go to all that hassle it is a pretty great stand or if you do not use the apple bumper case i suppose it would be a great stand without any hassle,109,76
4340,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,the metal finish makes it an attractive way to sync your iphone to a mac or pc,17,77
4341,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,nicefor iphone 4 a little disappointed that it does not work with the apple bumper on the phone i bought 2 of these one for my husband and one for me specifically so that we would not have to take off the bumper to charge the phone the photos looked like a bumper was on the phone but it does not fit with the bumper on,67,78
4342,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,do not waste your money on this even although it may look nice it is just not worth the 30 dollars it is not sturdy and the cable is headache to plug in every time i put my 3gs in i bought a small ihome instead for 40 and it works and looks better,52,79
4343,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,I had consider buying this one again the only problem i have is that the connector mount is a little flimsy should connect to any ipod device not effortless to connect,32,80
4344,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,what a nice looking piece of crap says you cana 3gs with incase case on nope rocks back and forth gets a charge sometimes sometimes not it is now is my trash can and i am shopping for another do not waste your money on this,48,81
4345,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,the design is nice but it looks bigger in the picture than it really is because of that the weight is light and it can tip over also the connectors on the bottom are light plastic and break easily finally if you use a small case on your iphone it may fit but you may have problems with charging bigger cases will not fit to sit properly on the charger,69,82
4346,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,i needed athat would hold the iphone4 in a case this is not thati have at least 6 cases from the apple bumper to the incipio featherlite and the iphone would not sync in thiswith any of the cases also as at least one other review pointed out the fit where the connector seats into the bottom of theis sloppy and loose it functions fine if the iphone4 is without a case but the feel does not inspire confidence I am waiting for a sema leather case and if thisdoes not work with that case I shall have to keep looking,108,83
4347,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i bought a new aftermarket stereo for my old 97 civic which has a usb port on the front so you can connect your ipod / iphone and stream music through the cars system unfortunately the car does not have anyplace for me to put my iphone while I am driving that is even remotely convenient i was basically connecting it and letting the phone drift around the passenger seat obviously this situation would not fly for long so i started looking for some way to mount a bracket orfor the phone and settled on this one package of the new velcro heavy-duty hook and loop fastener strips later velcro stick-on auto adhesive backed and i have thismounted on the dash in my car with the usbrunning into my car stereo I am using a pretty thick combination wallet / case for my iphone and it still fits nicely in thethe roads here are bumpy as can be and it still has not managed to bounce out of contact very satisfied,173,84
4348,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i love the sleek look of my silver docking station this fits the iphone 4 more securely than the old iphone 3 docking stations,24,85
4349,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,it is well made thoughtfully designed and looks smart i purchased the aluminum which matches the apple brushed aluminum scheme on my iphone 4 the cable can be swapped out for a longer one if necessary it has pads so that it does not scratch the iphone nor the desktop,49,86
4350,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,nice design stylishable to charge the iphone4 without removing the protection case hold perfectly the iphone,18,87
4351,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,this works well and is stylish i have an iphone 4 and an ipad and it works with both both in cases my only complaint keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the way thecable connects to the actual stand it is a little loose but it is not fallen out so it is functional overall a good product,59,88
4352,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,this product came from the seller as advertised and on time the product works exceptionally well with both our iphone 3 g and iphone 4 which now requires a case to prevent antenna blocking i bought two and they work just as i needed tomy iphones to pcs,49,89
4353,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the aluminum base it very stylish but the provided charging cord did not work i replaced it with one from apple but with a case or bumper installed the phone would not settle in down far enough to snap into the phone base therefore making it pretty much unusable for me with the replaced cable and removal of the phone case it works fine but not for me,68,90
4354,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,i purchased thisbecause it was listed as compatible with both the iphone 4 and the ipad theworks very well with the iphone 4 bumper and the other third party cases that i have with the iphone i have no complaints thealso accepts the ipad however once mounted on the stand the ipad is very top heavy it does not feel sturdy as you use it things wiggle around and it is just not sturdy enough to use day to day as an ipad stand i tend to worry that theis going to put too much stress on the usb connection i ran to michaels crafts and found a mini easel for around 14 and it works perfectly the only downside is that the cable is not integrated,134,91
4355,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,bought this specifically to use with iphone 4 and a bumper the connector is too wide to allow mating with the iphone 4 however these two are going back the konnet web site does not make claims about iphone 4 compatibility only amazon do not know who has responsible for the amazon copy,51,92
4356,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,as others have noted this is hardly a heavy-duty piece of hardware it does tend to disassemble itself if you do not use a little care in plugging and unplugging your phone however it is easy to put back together and use we are using it with iphones that are inside protective cases one is in the rubber case that squaretrade gives away with it is warranty the other is in a speck candyshell case no problem making connection for charging in either case using the cable that came with the stand you need to press down slowly and firmly to make initial contact and then it charges just fine pull straight up and the phone comes right off when done,117,93
4357,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,this cradle works perfectly and looks nice on the desk next to my mpb the cord that comes with it is easy to attach although it does move a bit when attaching or removing my iphone4 it is properly / securely held in place with the design i liked the silver design and the metal is sturdy and the stand comes with rubberized grips to prevent movement on slick surfaces,68,94
4358,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,does what it is supposed to and holds my iphone 4 while it syncs / charges only down side is that the back support does not actually touch the back of the iphone 4 so it is only held up by the connector seems stable enough just a little bit of pressure on the front of the phone causes it to make contact with the back so it does prevent the phone from bending / tipping when you try to use it in the cradle i received a free apple bumper when the bumper is on the phone the connector does not fully mate with the phone and thus you can not charge / sync some reviewers have complained about the packaging it is fairly intricate packaging but it only took me a minute to get theout of the packaging and i have a broken thumb took less time than it would if it was in a plastic blister-pack / clam-she shall,153,95
4359,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,this product works very well i had an iphone 3gand they will not work with my new iphone 4 so i looked for cheaper options around the internet rather than shelling out 2999 for another applethat will some day be out grown thisdoes exactly what it is supposed to it fits and charges my iphone 4 however to pay as much as the appleseems pretty crazy is not the point of third party software to be cheaper i had a 15 dollar off code from amazon so i purchased this and am very happy with it i just do not think i would have spent 30 on it,114,96
4360,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,while i really like the sturdy and stylish metal design of thisthe charge and sync cable that came with it worked only intermittently and actually nearly caused a fire while being used with my spouses iphone luckily the phone was not damaged needless to say we threw out the defective and cheap sync cable after that theitself is great but she shall out the 20 bucks for an actual apple sync cable or use the one included with thisat your own risk,88,97
4361,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,looks cool but connect is loose phone moves easy i would not buy again mine is in a desk drawer,20,98
4362,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,i purchased this product from a local frys for 20 for my iphone 4 i have a generic iphone gelly case i bought from the at t cellular world store similar to the case mate gelli case and seems to plug in fine with this metalwith case on it plugs in perfectly to charge and sync still requires a 2-handed pull off one handed insertion but it is not too loose or tight more on the loose side the phone just sits on the plasticconnector which is what keeps it upright it does not rest on the back metal piece probably because it is skinnier than the iphone 3gs not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they are saying it was difficult to plug in theirconnector into themine came with theconnector already plugged in and all i had to do was take it out of the packaging did take a little effort i guess to prevent stealing and plug it into a computer simple no instructions needed does come with plastic protectors so that the metal does not scratch the table it does come off too easily but some scotch tape can fix that also the cord does not stay through the back notch provided if you have the tendency to pick up thewhen pulling off the iphone but also easily solvable with some tape the cheapy part of the whole thing is where the cord meets theconnector on the underside very cheap plastic but i do not see it being a problem unless you decide to remove the cord provided also the cord length is only 3 ft long bought a usb 20 cord extension to solve that problem,288,99
4363,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my iphone 3 g and it worked great even with various cases however it does not work with iphone 4 with an apple bumper nor with the other 3rd party cases I have tried,38,100
4364,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,i should have heeded the adverse reviews and ignored the favorable ones first bad omen was trying to remove thefrom packaging a good test of patience strength and origami skills once opened surprise no instructions other than a hard-to-read decal on theso one has to figure out how to connect the cable with a flimsy plastic clip not an easy task then the feet that fasten on thefall off with the slightest movement of theon a desk finally an iphone with case does not easily fit on protruding connector worse the flimsy plastic clip does not hold the connector which falls out with the slightest pressure on top of all of this is the exorbitant price i read plenty of warnings about these deficiencies in various reviews but the attractive design of theshort-circuited the left side of my brain warning purchase at your peril,155,101
4365,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,my negative review is identical to the reveiw mentioned above please see those comments good looks cheap crunchy plastic connectors,20,102
4366,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,stylish but ultimately just not useful thefeels unstable and awkward you use your own iphone cable which is fine but thedoes not grip the connector in a very solid way several times when i attempted tothe cable just fell off the device is a victim of sloppy design or at least the useless plastic clip they provide I am confident that with a little tweaking they could make this a greatit is just not there yet,81,103
4367,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,i got this because some of the reviews indicated that you could have a cover on the iphone and still put this in the cradle just to clarify it might work with some covers but not all specifically the incase hard cases it does not work for the bottom of thehas two silicone feet the continuously fall off no issues with anything else on thei have not been able to find anotherthat allows for hard cases but hope to some day,86,104
4368,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,i love the quality of the aluminum on this product i got the black version of it my iphone 3 g s hooks up perfectly with my iskin solo fx on so you do not need to get it out of the case 5 stars for that my big question will it hook up on the iphone 4 I am going to highly likely because i think it got the space for it we will see when it comes out thank you,81,105
4369,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,i purchased this after several blogs pointed out that it would be great if you wanted to leave your iphone in it is case and charge it the design is sexy and nice well made however the process of putting the cable into the stand is very fragile and the directions for doing so are as cryptic as anyfurniture assembly the final blow alas was that the stand did not charge my iphone while in the case the charging plug kept popping out of the iphone tried multiple cables but it seems to be a design flaw of the stand the plug of the cable simply did not reach far enough through the opening in the stand i really wanted this to be the solution but it appears my quest shall continue,133,106
4370,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,junk not worth the money i could not get the iphone to cradle securely and the small pieces to connect are junk and break the only thing good was that i received full refund,34,107
4371,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,really pleased with this docking / charging stand was able to use it with the case on my iphone all the others i have tried you had to take the case off in order to use compact and attractive so glad i got it,42,108
4372,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,i recently purchased thisbased on a previous review i read on amazon that allows for an iphone with a case to be synced without having to remove it from the case overall theis very sturdy and has a heavy metallic feel which is natural since it is metal the base comes with two small rubber stoppers on the top portion which is what usually keeps a uncased iphone in the correct angle in order to sync my iphone i had to remove these stoppers the first times I have gone to connect my phone it is not really been the best experience the sync cable connects to the unit from below and locks into place with a plastic clip well as it turns out the clip i had on mine was not holding the cable correctly so basically it would snap the cable loose and it would fall down so basically I had have to hold the cable from below while connecting the phone and then it would work fine however i wrote the manufacturer on their website and they promptly sent me a replacement clip as well as the top connector and this should do the trick overall if you have an iphone with a case and want to use athis is a must have,217,109
4373,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,I have owned this docking station for over a month and the overall quality has frustrated me first the cheap plastic locking mechanism to set the cable in place is a challenge to install two of three colleagues who purchased this device broke the plastic during the install the rubber grommet on the plastic sleeve is pretty useless the two rubber feet used to protect your desk furniture fall off every time i move the stand arghh and finally the cutout for the cable on the base does not hold the cable in place especially frustrating when moving the stand not worth the money I am going to,103,110
4374,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,within a month after i received thisthe charging / sync cable stopped working the original cable that came with my phone works fine with thebut i need that cable elsewhere now I am out apporximately 28 for theand I am having trouble locating a replacement cable to use with it any suggestions would be appreciated i would think that amazon would replace the cable but I am not really seeing any procedure where i could make that request,79,111
4375,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,this iphone stand is the best looking I have seen and I have researched them quite a bit it works great and is just as advertised my only criticism is that it is a bit over priced however i guess you get what you pay for thanks,45,112
4376,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the icrado is not simple to use i was looking for a clean and simple docking station for my ipod that would help reduce clutter and prevent my ipod from falling off my desk the icrado is no easier to connect to an ipod than the white cable that comes with the ipod as to the design of the unit it is attractive but not as functional as i hoped i have other docks for the home portable phone and a wireless mouse that are rather simple you just get your device close and it slides in and starts charging not so with the icrado i can not do it in the light from the computer monitor and even with the lights on you have to get right in front of it and it pretty much takes a couple tries then you have to shift it a little to make sure it is connected the ipod is secure once it is in and it does look good overall i would not recommend this product although it looks good and clean you have to fumble with it too much toyour ipod,193,113
4377,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,it is really comfortable to put on your desktop and just insert your iphone without having to remove the case the reason i gave it a 3 out of 5 is because the cable that comes with it keeps disconnecting my iphone i have an iphone 3 g 16 gb and when i plug it in it disconects and reconnects at random intervals and for random periods of time it is really annoying and the phone does not charge as well however you can install an apple cable instead that should fix the problem so i think it is still worth it but a little annoying this problem may not apply for ipods,107,114
4378,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,attractive and useful this little holderdevice gets the job done if you just need a simple sturdy place to park your ipod / iphone to listen to it or sync it this is a pretty good choice and value pros light weight and holds your ipod or iphone fairly securely your iphone / ipod can stay in whatever case or cover it is in while in thisraises the iphone up so that the speaker and microphone are deflected and slightly amplified acoustically use with or without ear buds / headphones comes with usb connector / syncing cord no special adapters needed for any model / generation of iphone or ipod cons only holds iphone in vertical position so watching movies using games or apps in widescreen mode is out cheap silicone non-skid foot pads for the rearkeep coming off without some sort of adhesive not included and good luck getting anything to stick to the silicone sometimes you have to press the device down fairly hard to get the best connection still given all that i do like and would recommend this product to other iphone / ipod users that need a inexpensive docking solution with a small footprint for their desk table or counter that allows them to hear music and use the speaker phone while docked without headphones / ear buds,213,115
4379,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,great product i was looking for a charging station and cradle for my iphone easy to use nice design very pleased with purchase,23,116
4380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,the konnet icrado does exactly what it says i use it as a charging100 of the time good looks and style that match my home office my iphone 3 g s fits on the charging jack with several types of cases,42,117
4381,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,this contraption holds a standard usb / ipod cable so that you can set your ipod / iphone onto it unfortunately the cable is not built in it is held in place by a flimsy piece of plastic i expect it to break at any moment it moves a bit combine that motion with my speck ipod touch cover and seating the ipod can get tricky once seated it works as advertised the cable that comes with this hunk of twisted metal is adequate but clearly not the quality of the oem cable that came with my ipod touch 3 g because it works as advertised i rate it 3 stars however the value for the money is very low it is an over priced hunk of twisted metal in my opinion this is a 4 cable and a 5 piece of painted metal with a 30 price tag i should have taken the reviews i read on thisto heart,157,118
4382,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,this is not a standaloneit is a holder for a cable and the one provided does not work with iphone 3 g rubber feet that push on but fall off when unit is moved it looks nice but is poorly designed pricey for a bent piece of metal,48,119
4383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,this is a terrific product that i would highly recommend it is superior to the apple universalin terms of quality and ease-of-use with regards to docking i use this product with my iphone without having to remove it is case and no more having to swap out adapters if i need tomy ipod touch the charging syncing cable could have been a little bit longer so you might want to buy a usb extension cable if you want to place the icrado more than 2 feet from your computer,93,120
4384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,do not let the description deceive you i received this product today only to discover it is made of plastic not metal,21,121
4385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,the icrado definitely looks sleek and it is sturdy i have 2 problems with it the connectionpart is not as secure as I had like it this device holds a usb / ipod cable so that you can set your ipod / iphone down onto it unfortunately it moves some because it is not built into the metal part of thealso i have a thin rubber case that wraps around my phone although it has an opening for aat the bottom it sometimes prevents getting a close connection with the icrado i do not completely blame the icrado for that theis cool looking and i like that it comes in black but it is very over priced i bought 2 of them and due to the iffy connection sometimes i can not say that i highly recommend it,138,122
4386,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,works great use it every day love that it came with an extra cable instructions a little hard to understand had to go to web site to figure out,33,123
4387,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,I am not sure what to say about the other reviews other than maybe there was some product variation in sizing initially mine is very tight exactly like i want it to be but it is not causing any button presses unless you touch the button it fits like a glove my power button is not hard to press my volume buttons are a little tougher and take a very firm press but they are loosening up after just a day of use i personally do not like the soft floppy silicone cases that leave gaps around the side this is a hard rubber / soft plastic kind of feeling case and i like that i think it gives the right balance of cushion from a fall more than a hardshell case but is not floppy or a dust magnet like a silicone case it gives the back of the iphone a frosted gray look but the sides and front are clear so you can still see the beautiful metal on the sides i really like this case a lot and plan to get a black version for my wife,184,0
4388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,it protects the phone fine and i do not have any technical issues with it however i have the clear case an it is starting to discolor around the top side edges turning a brownishi have tried to clean with no luck looking like i will have to get a replacement if it gets worse,56,1
4389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i have the invisibleshield on my iphone 4 and unfortunately it does not really work with it the sides of the case lays slightly on top of the screen and causes the shield to peel off i tried lifting up the sides of the case and laying them directly on top of the shield do that it would not peel it off but it does not work either whenever there has pressure on the sides of the case it will cause the shield to come off as far as the button problem i have not had an issue with it you can not hear the clicks when the buttons are pressure but you can still see that they are working on the screen overall this is a good case but not if you have the invisibleshield but since there has really no other case out yet on the market I shall keep it till incase comes out with something,149,2
4390,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,fit this case fits tightly and perfectly around the iphonein the original photo thelooks like a purplish tint however from up close it is more purple protection the case is made of hard yet flexible plastic material and provides good protection against scratches and minor damages grip the grip feels great and prevents from slips issue the plastic covers the volume control buttons and the on / off switch button on the top it may be hard to press these especially at first but it seems that overtime the plastic would move easier right now i have to press the volume buttons with my nails for them to work the same goes with the sound on / off swith on the side which probably needs to be reached with your nail as well overall i am happy with the product,140,3
4391,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this is by far the best case i have found for the iphone 4 it fits great is very thin seems to provide good shock absorption and it slides in your pocket easy i say this after trying out about a dozen i have had no problems with the screen lock as others mentioned and i can easily flip the ringer switch the buttons were very stiff and hard to press at first but they get better every day i like that you can see although it and it does not collect lint or scratches i bought three for my family and could not be happier,105,4
4392,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i already ordered my belkin grip vue case for my iphone 4 before i had read some of the reviews here I am glad it happen that way otherwise i might have missed out on a quality case i was a little nervous about my decision until the case came and i was able to try it out for myself i found that the case fits perfect and does not interfere with the touch screen at all the material is great it has a nice shock resistance factor without being a lint collector it took a few hours of regular use to break-in the material over the buttons once it was broken in i was able to press all the buttons with ease i love the look of this case because it allows the aesthetics of the iphone 4 to show through the clear casing while providing significant protection just what i wanted I had highly recommend this case to anyone who wants good solid impact protection but still wants to show off the beauty of the iphone 4s design,178,5
4393,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,while the other two keep having there iphone lock all the time when they do not want it too i have the opposite problem the case is so thick that i can never lock my phone when i press the buttons on the top and side nothing happens look elsewhere,49,6
4394,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,like the other reviewer said this case is flawed and causes the screen to constantly lock do not buy,19,7
4395,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,the top part of the case is so tight that it keeps locking the screen with the lightest touch to the case i do not recommend this,28,8
4396,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,the camera hole and volume hold and on / off buttons do not match up this is such a huge and obvious flaw i have nohow this design could have gone to production and worse yet could have easily been fixed the buttons are also covered by the tough plastic flexible case which would make then hard to press i needed a case so i ended up cutting out ragged holes with an xacto knife i like the material and that it is clear so this would be a great case if only it had holes instead of button covers and all the holes matched up,104,9
4397,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,started to turn yellow 12 weeks or so after i got it i guess that is what you get for the price,21,10
4398,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,fit so so function so so replaced after 2 weeks just not good as good can be acase makes a much better minimal phone case for my mind,29,11
4399,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i was cheated they sent me a yellow old rusty case completely useless a complete desappoinment do not buy it,20,12
4400,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,when i ordered the case it came yellow and covered in scratches they would not take it back horrible product lolz,20,13
4401,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,I am not comfortable with the product the cover does not fit the requested phone model it is very tight does not look good the product arrived in poor condition i mean dirty it seems that long had stored,38,14
4402,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,this this is yellow not clear this thing must have been sitting in a warehouse somewhere the paper that sat inside the case almost fell apart in my hands only got two stars because it did not fall apart when i put it on my phone,45,15
4403,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i thought there would not be any fitting issue since 4s had been release more than 2yrs but i was wrong i did not bother to check what versions it fits or which does not apparently the product description did not mention it either the mute button does not align with opening which forms a bulge on the side it is just ugly it was not for myself but obvisouly it did not appeal to the person who received it,79,16
4404,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,in the picture it looks clean clear and transpartent it is not it looks yellow used and it even came dirty I am very disappointed,24,17
4405,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,loved it easy grip and good protection came right away easy to put on one of my favorites had to buy my son one too,25,18
4406,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i have an iphone 4s and this case fits well but the ringer button is partially covered by the case making it difficult to turn on and off also the lock and volume buttons are also very difficult to push the product itself did not come for ten days and it is definitely not worth the wait I am very disappointed and will not be using this case whatsoever save your money and buy something that actually fits the iphone,78,19
4407,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,after using this product for around 30 to 45 days it started to present a yellowish tone not clear anymore if you are using a white iphone it will make your iphone looks awful,34,20
4408,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,this case was not new it came foggy dirty yellowed so nasty i did not even want to touch it let alone use it on my phone it was definitely not like the picture shown belkin makes good products but i would go to a store the next time to purchase what i know is a new clean product even if it is more money,63,21
4409,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,when i got it i thought it was going to be white but it is like a dirty white i do not know if it is me but,24,22
4410,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,ordered the case said it was new came in a cheap cellophane bag not shrink wrapped or with any packaging looks fake to me could have ordered a fake on ebay for 1,34,23
4411,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,the belkin grip vue tint case for the iphone offers great protection it is a quality case for the money,20,24
4412,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,good inexpensive place clear case holds up well to my occasional drop and i still use it often thanks,20,25
4413,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,this phone case is very sturdy and seems to protect my phone well which is the main point of having a phone case i spose however i have a white iphone and rather than being perfectly clear the plastic has kind of a yellowish tint to it it is not a big deal it just was not what i expected based on the pictures also I am not sure if this is because of differences between the 4 and the 4s but the hole over the vibrate switch does not line up quite right all in all not bad but not super wonderful either,100,26
4414,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,you get what you pay for this case arrived very fast but it is a very tight fit on my at t iphone 4 i can press the middle of the top prtion next to the power button and cut the phone on and also the volumr button was hard to press after putting the cover over them just did not fit right also it is not crystal clear like the picture on the amazon pic it is a little foggy,77,27
4415,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,it is more of a creamthan clear the lock button opening did not match up it does not come up around the face of the phone causing it to look wider also the back is not completely clear it is a little cloudy if you are looking for the crystal clear case this is not the one,56,28
4416,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,this is my first smart phone and so it is also my first smart phone case i got the clear case and it is kind of ugly but in the first month of using it it has already saved my phone from damage when i dropped it the holes for access to ports line up nicely and it does not need to be removed for charging i like the soft grip of the case because it makes for more secure holding and keeps the phone from sliding around inside the car the price was right especially compared to other cases I shall keep it,101,29
4417,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this iphone cover is great it is a very good protector for the iphone ad fits very well resists scratches,20,30
4418,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i liked the case a lot it protected my iphone well however it yellowed very quickly but it did it is job i suppose,23,31
4419,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,this case had some kind of weird film on the case i had to scrub it with soap and a brush to remove also the hole for the vibrate switch is not quite cut right i like the looks and feel of the case,43,32
4420,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,I have had perhaps a half dozen or so cases for my iphone4 and this one by far is the best the opening for theconnector is large enough to work with most 30 pin connectors it has a lot of shock resilience i have dropped my phone from chest height a number of times onto hard surfaces like concrete and my phone never cracked or scratched it protects the screen with it is raised bezel as well as all the buttons the material it is made of tpu i think pliable and smooth enough to slide into and out of my pocket without being too grabby but has enough grip that i can hold it easily it is not the prettiest case in the world but the functionality is impressive it is the best insurance policy you can get for under 15,139,33
4421,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i liked thisi think it is normal quality i liked thisi think it is normal quality,20,34
4422,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this is a nice case if i had an iphone 4 but i have a 4s i was still able to use it on my phone but the hole for the silent button and the volume buttons were slightly shifted besides that i thought the case protected my phone well i dropped it a few times and no scratches or cracks i also really like the purple,65,35
4423,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this is an awesome product for those who like to carry the cellphones in their pockets is great for taking fall i cellphone has taken a couple of falls from about 4 feet so far no damage to my cellphone I have own this case for about a year now the only downfall is that the plastic does yellow a bit after some time overall great buy recommend you buy,69,36
4424,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i got this case because the reviews were all so good then when it actually arrived i hated it it is not clear and definitely not worth 18 bucks i should have gotten a speck which would protect my phone way better than this crap and is way cheaper,47,37
4425,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,the case looks like it is sold but when i put it on my phone i could not lock it or power in without it being difficult it would hold the power button down causing it to go to the power off slider the volume and vibrate button / switch are not lined up correctly definitely does not fit like the old one i use to have that i bought from apple,66,38
4426,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this case is not going to offer protection against drops but i love that it is not bulky i think this was the best slim non-shock absorbing case i could find the white looks gorgeous in all it is white shiny iphone glory also purchased a white defender for when i need it at work but i use this day to day it is slightly frosted but i think in the long run will stay nicer than if it was clear the case comes off very easy and fits perfect with a zagg it stops in just the right spot so it will not push on the edges of the zagg shield i paid 6 for mine the buttons work very well through the case and the stock iphone cables fit through the openings without removing the case but the earbuds are tight my older iphone car charger and ipod cables are a hair too big have to pull away the bottom to fit but the cable that came with the phone goes in easily buy this one looks the most functional thing it is capable of is preventing car key scratches in your purse if the headphone jack was larger i would have given this 5 stars,206,39
4427,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,ok so i have the s and apparently it is different from the regular 4 anyway that is not even the concern i understand if i put scratches on my case it is self from everyday use and wear but when it is brand new out the box with scratches and already faded yellow yeah do not buy this if you have a s or even if you have a 4 i think what they do is put the ones that people return in the boxes and sell them again anyway horrible product,89,40
4428,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i like the material bought it for an iphone 4s and had to use a knife to make the hole bigger for the silence switch the big issue is that the material looks fine when you get it not clear but still looks good but will turn brown in six months or less really not cool,56,41
4429,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,case protects and is snug on the phone love the frosted / transcendent look easy grip case prevents easy slips thissuits it is purpose prompt service from this seller,28,42
4430,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,picture looked like case would be clear as glass but it was frosted the volume buttons are also hard to pushing the case makes my screen protector get pushed away from the screen,33,43
4431,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,thissimply costs too much for it is quality it is gummy and a little loose the buttons do not quite fit it would be fine if you had an image or picture you wanted to insert in the back to create a custom case but even then you would need to secure the photo get something better,55,44
4432,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,on my white iphone the clear case sort of looks yellow however it is an excellent case it fits very well and truly grips on,25,45
4433,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my wifes white iphone 4s it fits great and it does not make the phone bulky like other cases however the case is not transparent when used with a white iphone it gives it a yellowish tone to the phone not that it is bad but i wish i should have known it before buying,57,46
4434,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,when this arrived it had scratches and fingerprints all over it and a yellowish tint it looked like it had been heavily used this might have been acceptable if I had only paid a few bucks for it if that but not for 1800,43,47
4435,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,this was not a clear cover the back is frosted and it makes my iphone look terrible cover is not formed to have opening for mute switch uncovered and does not fit correctly the frosted back was scratched and it shows through as a clear cover this is a fail very poor i can not believe i spent money on a cover that was not engineered correctly i would not recommend,70,48
4436,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,I have had this case since aug 2011 and it is been great bought it on clearance at walmart for less than 10 and regret not buying two since i can not find another one for that price my phone and this case have been through a lot over the past few months for example last month i managed to drop it out a car window while doing 60 mph on the interstate and nothing happened to it after this experience i have to question how people are able to break the front or rear glass on these phones i would not recommend repeating what i did since it was pretty stupid and i got lucky it did not bounce / roll off the bridge yep on a bridge when it fell out of the car but if that did not break the glass or even scratch the phone in any way so how do others break their phones glass pros feels great protects phone extremely well protects the phone from the following falling off a table dropping out of your hand when thrown by 2yr old when dropped into a cup of water not sure if this was the case or just pure luck but no damage and no water markers changedwhen dropped out of car at 60 mph cons fades due to the heat fading turns the case yellow-ish makes it look dirty will probably pick up another one from amazon until the iphone5 comes out hopefully belkin will make a similar one for the new model,251,49
4437,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,i like this enough but it is not made for the verizon iphone 4 so it does not fit just right and it is most certainly not as clear as it appears in the photo it is more see-through foggy but not crystal clear like the photo but that is to be expected since it is a flexible case and not hard plastic it seems very well made as would be expected from belkin if i had an at t phone or if it was made for and fit my verizon one it would be perfect,88,50
4438,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,I have had this case on my iphone4 for a year or so paid msrp it shows off the great design of the iphone fairly slim has enough grip while sliding easily in and out of pockets and has protected the phone from drops on concrete from heights that i would swear should shatter the glass my only complaint and reason for only 3 stars is that over time the clear case has yellowed to a rather unappealingto the point where co-workers have commented on it i would definitely buy this case for my next phone but in one of thetints,105,51
4439,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i like this product it is great for the new white iphone users who want to flaunt theinstead of having the black on white look have not dropped my phone yet so i can not attest to it is durability but i would guess it would help at least some due to it is gel quality,52,52
4440,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,this pathetic not just the exposed part of the case from the packaging but the entire case is scratched and ruined the seal a piece of tape was present therefore i do not know if it was just replaced and it is a used case or if belkin just makes such inferior products,53,53
4441,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i really like this case i bought it because i did not want to hide my beautiful white i phone so clear was perfect the only down fall is i can not plug in the headphone adapter but i do not use it as an ipod anyway so for me and my uses a great purchase it was,56,54
4442,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i returned this product because while priced well it was not clear at all but instead dingy and yellowed,20,55
4443,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,horrible used re-packaged and frankly an abused product the clear case had scuffs and was discolored it has been returned,20,56
4444,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,the phone cover fits my phone but where the switch is on the side of my phone the phone cover does not match up to it also i have a screen protector on my phone and it causes my protector to bubble little things I am just picky,45,57
4445,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,not sure why they are selling this it does not fit over the att iphone 4 mute button is partially covered,20,58
4446,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i checked out reviews for different cases on the apple website and this one had the best reviews it fits really well and because it is sleek and clear for the most part allows you to show off the elegant apple design i get tired of seeing bright pink or purple cases love this one most of the buttons line up one is a little bit off but still functional,70,59
4447,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,the labeling on this case is misleading i was looking for a completely clear case i was disappointed to discover this clear case is actually slightly opaque not really clear at all also this case does not fit my transmitteroverall i like the material of the case and the fit it is just not clear,56,60
4448,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,really like this case it is tough and slim which means it is not hard to stick in your pocket and you feel safe to pull it out and lay it on a table when you want to and not worry what has goin to happen if it hits the ground,48,61
4449,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,thisis not well described here first of all it does not fit the iphone4s at t the volume buttons are hard to press and the mute button is stuck under the cover you can barely toggle it with your finger-nail the vue tint does not look good on the black iphone it gives it a very dull look definitely not recommended for black iphones not sure how it would be on the white iphone although in all not worth the price i am looking for a better case for my phone to replace this one cheers,97,62
4450,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,I have used belkin cases for several years and like them this is my first time ordering one from amazon however the case arrived in a sealed belkin display box well it was taped shut anyway with a label that says new it very obviously is not new it is been used there are scuffs and scratches on the inside and outside of the case along with several greasy fingerprints the bottom port for the power cord is dented and has some pen marks as if someone tried to dig out the power cable plug with an ink pen I am sure it will work just fine it is simply a case for protection but the seller needs to clearly state that these are used so four stars for trusting in my past experience with belkin products seller honesty would have made it five,141,63
4451,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i upgraded my phone to iphone 4s and needed a nice sleek and simple case anyway this case is ok and will not bulk up the phone at all it also has a good grip and will not scratch your phone from putting it on and off the only concern i have is the hole for the silent mode button is not completely aligned i hope it will not push the button inside over time and because some damage to the phone it is a nice case for the price although but it is not perfectly suitable for iphone 4s from at t,97,64
4452,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,bought this case because i like to personalize / customize things and i wanted to slip a piece of scrapbook paper in the back it is perfect for this and i can now change my case anytime i feel like it you could use pictures digital scrapbook layouts or any pretty paper for a completely custom case for cheap total project was under 8 bucks and i can change the insert anytime i want for pennies can not beat this deal,79,65
4453,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,this case did not fit the iphone like most cases and seems to be cheaply made the hole for the camera is not even a perfect circle and it is made of a cheap flimsy plastic i sent mine back,39,66
4454,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this phone case fits perfectly it is not too tight it is not too loose it is perfect i do have the at t iphone pros -looks great when you first start to use it very slim very functional i drop my phone constantly on concrete dirt asphalt wherever it lands on all corners facesand not one crack or even a scratch on the phone works great cons -no matter what i did the case kept peeling the edges off of my screen protector the case is a frosty clear at first but it discolored into a dirty brown this is my 2nd case because the first one got so bad and now my second case is turning blue right now dust gets inside the case easily great case worth the money,130,67
4455,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed with this product first of all this was suppose to be a new unopened case for the iphone it clearly was not due to the sloppy re taping then when i finally took the case out it had all types of smudges and marks i would never again purchase from this product,55,68
4456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i ordered this iphone case 2 days after i had bought my iphone because i had seen it on a friends and it looked slim but protective however i had bought a 25 screen protecter when i bought the iphone that you are supposedly able to wash and reuse which was exactly what i did when i put the screen protecter on the iphone and then this case to follow the screen protecter kept popping up creating space between the protector and the screen at first i thought the because of this was that it was not sticky after washing it but i came to realize that this case was the problem every time i would slide it on it would squeeze the screen protector up very frustrating if you are one of those people who want to protect their screen with a screen protector then do not purchase this case however if you will do without a protector this case is slim fitted and protective,165,69
4457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,easy to put on your iphone 4s very good quality volume adjust buttons camera hole charger input hole everything placed correct but the hole for left hand side button where you adjust ringing to vibrating and which i use very often is incorrect it should be more closer to the volume increasing button for that reason this case does not fit perfect on the upper left corner of my phone also it should be transparent init was indeed but in a month or so it got yellow it looks like an old case now,96,70
4458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i have a white iphone 4 from verizon and this case did not fit it that well it was too tight and the ringer switch cutout did not align i had to take off the case to plug in my aux cable for my car and it is hard to press the volume buttons and power button i wish i knew before i ordered this that it does not fit verizon iphones,71,71
4459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,fits snug but is not clear disappointed that is it not true to it is description not sure if this is a true belkin case either bc the bottom seemed like it had a defect not a clean lining,38,72
4460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i love this case i am very particular about hw my protective cases fit and this gets two thumbs up or five stars it wraps around the face of the screen so if the phone falls and lands face-down there is a little lip to protect it from being flat on a surface it is not bulky either i find it to be a very snug fit and does not feel floppy like some cases I have tried i had the 3gs version with my old phone and this was a hands-down purchase when i upgraded to the 4 husband has the 4s and it fits his perfectly as well i just wish it came in a hot pink my only qualm is that some car chargers do not fit all that well into the cutout but that is a very minor issue the apple cable fits as well as my radiowithout removing the case go for it you will not be disappointed,164,73
4461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this case fits the iphone 4s i could not find that information anywhere else on here i chose this case because i keep my phone in my front pants pocket and needed a case that did not have too much friction this case is smooth enough that i can slide it out of my pocket without any problems great deal for around 8 dollars,62,74
4462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,thisworked almost perfect for iphone 4s it covers a little the button to put on silence or vibrate mode,21,75
4463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i have the white iphone from verizon and so i wanted a clear case to show that i have the white iphone duh how else can i prove my worth in society unless i can show off theof my phone in all seriousness i mean i just wanted a clear soft case to protect my phone the problem with the case that i have found is that it is not really clear more of a fuzzy yellow and so i am now off to find something better the case itself fits perfectly and all the buttons work fine and more I am just tired of seeing that yellowish hue on the back,110,76
4464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i got this for my iphone 4s and the switch to turn the ringer off does not line up with the hole what a disappointment i will not be buying this brand again,31,77
4465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,i have an iphone 4s verizon and the buttons do not line up on this case the volume buttons are fine but i would not be able to click the mute button on and off were it not for long fingernails guys are going to have a hard time with this one that said i dropped my phone off a counter in a public restroom today and it did not shatter into a million pieces the case fits well also i have the black phone and this looks pretty sleek and does not add too much bulk it does attract a little lint but i will not be looking for another case any time soon unless they fix the alignment for the mute button,120,78
4466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,theis great but it does not fit the iphone 4s plus it fits to tight in the screen and if you have a screen protector it will create bubbles on it,33,79
4467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i agree with the other reviews that theis not the same as pictured it is a true bright purple unlike the dark purplish blue one like in the photos but theis amazing and i was not able to find anything like this at other stores i like this case because it provides great protection without being bulky i had previous cases that were so big that i would not be able to fit my phone onto an ihome or chargingthis fits just right i have an iphone from sprint however when my case came in the mail there were a lot of scratches on it this was upsetting seeing how i paid for brand new one they are not terribly noticeable but i would have expected a brand newfor the price i paid overall I am happy but would have expected a case without scratches on it,150,80
4468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this case fits the iphone perfectly and yet still allows for full usage of all functions looks great is not bulky and tough to beat for the price,27,81
4469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,love this case clearcompliments phone case is small yet provides good protection great price and fit is perfect nice job belkin,23,82
4470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i have had otterboxes since the 3gs was released and loved the protection they offered i finally upgraded to the iphone 4 and wanted a sleeker case that still offered decent protection i understand that this is not an otterbox nor does it offer the same protection but if you do not want a bulky case that still offers moderate protection then this is a good deal for about 10 it is compact enough to not add too much to the phone and it is sturdy enough to protect the phone from a short fall the frosted look is nice but if you want to show off theof the phone it will wash it out i also wanted something that does not have that pocket stickiness and this does the trick while still being easy to hold the cutouts for the charging cable and headphone jack are good and do not interfere with anything I have tried to plug in and the silence button is accessible enough people that complain that the button is too deep should complain to apple about the size of the button the case needs to be thick enough to offer protection to the phone the covered buttons are easy to push on mine the cutout for the flash does not interfere with picture taking the case itself is snug around the phone all in all i am very happy with the case for 10 you can not go wrong,237,83
4471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,does not fit well to my iphone the hole for ringer button is not in the right position do not buy,20,84
4472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this is cheap and effective and far better protection than the apple bumper that i previously had for some of the phones i believe the verizon and my wifes 4s the silent operation switch may need to have the case modified to work properly with it as it is lower on those phones than it is on a at t iphone 4 also the bottom portion where the ipod connector goes does not fit with my car stereos adapter and needed to be cut with a razor i could honestly give a rats ass about aesthetics but even with the cut outs it still looks good and functions well as could be hoped,111,85
4473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,does not exactly fit the phone right even although it is an iphone 4 and that is what the case is for,21,86
4474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,so i bought this upon reading the great reviews of how well this protects the iphone i was aware of the clear case being more like a frosted plastic and was okay with that before purchasing however when i received this product it was full of cosmetic defects one side appeared to have come in contact with something heated as the case was melted the back of the frosted plastic had a bunch of fingerprints and what appeared to be oil buildup wash it off and then it is no big deal right no i tried washing these mysterious fingerprints and buildup off with degreasing soap and they are still there i have come to the conclusion that the fingerprints may have been imprinted during the molding process also the frosted plastic is not frosted in two areas which i can not explain overall this seems like a defective product or previously used disappointed because i bought directly from amazon which usually means they have better quality and the product is less likely to be a rip-off tl dr do not buy this expecting a high quality product 9 dollars can not buy a high quality product these days this product was made cheaply in china buyer beware just because it is sold by amazon does not guarantee a good / quality product,215,87
4475,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,this thing was a disappointment foggy / pastie would be a good description of it is appearance the case also does not fit the iphone 4s ringer / vibrate button properly,26,88
4476,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,case is lose on the phone the top button no longer works when the case is on constantly turning my phone off had to cut a hole in the top of the case to allow for the top button to work dust easily gets behind the case do not buy this case it is garbage,55,89
4477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,fits tight adds very little bulk to my iphone 4s case is sticky enough to reduce the likelihood of dropping it i have no problem operating all the buttons small holes for the speakers bottomwere a delightful surprise i rated it 5 stars so the following should be taken as nits rather than real complaints just for full disclosure the case fits so tightly that the screen protector does not fit flush I am paranoid about protecting my investment so the screen protector went on even before i powered it up i said i was paranoid the case overlapped the screen protector i could cut one to fit but decided to go without the glass front is much harder to scratch than the older plastic faces and the case has a nice lip on the front to prevent scratches when you put the phone down on it is face i like the lip also because i hope it will protect that front glass at least a little when i inevitably drop the phone on a hard surface the cutout for the ring / vibrateonly switch does not quite line up with the switch on the 4s still completely operable just not perfect the cutout for the universal connector bottomof the phone works fine with modern connectors some older and third-party cables are thicker than the cutout and have to be forced in to get a good contact amazon sells modern cables very inexpensively so pick up a few extra this cable is the weakest link in the ios universe so have a few spares around,267,90
4478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,looks nice and slides in and out of my pockets pretty easily only thing is that it blocks the connection at the bottom for my ipod hookup in my car i have the grom adapter so anyone that has that should stay away because it is annoying,47,91
4479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,false advertising thewas pictured as clear but what i received was a frosted case not clear at all,20,92
4480,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,when i received this case i thought it looked a little off in coloring and not entirely clear i used it for no more than 3 days and it turned a yellow / browni would not recommend buying this if you are looking for a true clear case that will stay clear this just makes a nice white iphone look dirty,61,93
4481,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,after having this case for 2 months it is started turning orange-brown i cleaned it with bleach but it still did not come out other than that the protection is good and the buttons are easier to press than other cases,39,94
4482,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i have a white verizon iphone 4 so i wanted to have a case that would allow me to show off the white phone the front glass is protected by a standard film the case slips in and out of my pocket with ease i sometimes put my monthly transit pass in the back of the case so as long as i have my phone with me all i have to do is show the back of it to the bus driver there are two aspects to a phone case 1 it should look good 2 it should protect the phone i was able to verify that this case meets the second when i dropped my phone on a gravel driveway the case protected the back and side of the phone perfectly i hope i do not test the case again update 10/31/11 I have noticed that the case is starting to get discolored it is still transparent but the back of my white iphone is starting to look a little yellow when viewed through the case i bought a couple more of these so i can just change the case every few months,192,95
4483,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this seller has great quality items i had just gotten the iphone maybe a week and a half ago and even before i had it i always fell in love with this case on other peoples phones verizon tried convincing me to get this case at their store and i knew i could find it more reasonably priced online this is my favoriteand i knew this was the case i wanted it was everything i expected it is just enough to make your iphone a statement without being too crazy and everyone kept saying how the buttons were stiff with the case on i did not notice the case making buttons hard to press at all the time reange for when thiswas to arrive was actually like 3 days earlier than the expected arrival date this owner gets items out as soon as possible after the order was placed this is an exceptional experience with this store owner if i ever need to order something i will definitely buy from this seller again overall i give thisand store owner an a,184,96
4484,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i ordered this case so that it would arrive in the mail at the same time as my iphone 4 arrived the shipping was great and on time but the case itself is unusable i did not mind that it was frosted once it is on the phone it does not look as tinted as it does right out of the package and the volume and silent buttons were easily accessible here is the problem at least with the one sent to me the case continuously holds pressure on the power button thus causing the iphone 4 to constantly go in and out of sleep mode as well as bring up the power down screen obviously this makes the phone inside this case unusable and i returned the product i tried a few different ways to resolve the physical problem with the case stretching the top a bit moving the phones around but nothing would work and i could not lock my phone with the case on it was also very annoying to keep cancelling from the power down screen i would not recommend this case,185,97
4485,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,upon reading the reviews after i purchased the product i was a little skeptical about it being what i was looking for this product was exactly what i wanted and fits perfectly and really shows off my white iphone 4 perfectly it fits perfectly on my iphone 4 for att and would recommend this product for any iphone 4 user who has the model for att very happy,68,98
4486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i received the case today and it seems to be well made the buttons line up fine and i do not have any trouble pushing them however the case does not really stay in place very well the sides of the case seem to bow out they pull away from the sides of the phone and it just looks like a poor fit i do not want a case that hangs off of the sides allowing stuff to get underneath it i plan to return it immediately,86,99
4487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i bought this case for my new iphone 4 from verizon the case does not fit the verizon iphone and the hole for the silent button does not even line up the sides were bulging and the power button was so tight it was permanently pushed down and continually tried to power down apparently the verizon iphone is slightly different than the at t iphone,64,100
4488,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,do not be fooled this is not a clear hard case this is a foggy translucent ruberized soft case even although the pictures on the front show crystal clear it is not,29,101
4489,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this case was actually for my boyfriend because he wanted something slim and not so bulky he absolutely loves it and it does not get caught going into or out of his pocket like his other cases did awesome case and great price,42,102
4490,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i bought this case when the iphone 4 first came out and there were not many choices available at the time the case fits the phone great and operating the buttons on the side and top improved with a few days use i have dropped the phone a number of times with out damage functionally the case is good however the clear case has totally discolored over time it is now a yellowish brown and quite unattractive so that is a bit of a bummer now i am looking for a new case the case does what it is supposed to do protecting the phone from drops and scratches but i am disappointed and hesitant to buy another belkin case,117,103
4491,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,the case that i recieved was not as clear as was indicated on the page the one that i got has a yellow-ish tint to it it does not look good at all i also want to mention that on the back there is a spot where it is more translucent than the rest of the case i think that spot is how the whole case should look like on top of that there are a number of smudges and lines on the case it looks like the case has been used before and the lines do not look like they will come off i would expect a site like amazon to sell good products and do not get me wrong most of the time it does it is a great site just this time I am a little disappointed,134,104
4492,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,unlike some people who bought this so far it does not mess up my screen protector that might have to do with the size of the protector the real pain was the top button this case keeps the button mashed down all the time on my at t iphone 4 i took a small piece of clear plastic the kind that manuals and stuff ofter comes in which is very thin and cut it out and folded it to fit between the top button and the headphone jack almost invisible and stops the button from being press down was not worth returning it and i needed a new case shame i had to hack it to make it work properly otherwise it is totally worth what I have paid for it update after a few days the sides are starting to open up on the front wound up taking it off and buying a different case locally that i could put on and see if it would work I have decided that it is best to not purchase phone cases online too many poorly fitting cases of inferior quality,182,105
4493,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,easy to put on and does the job it fits very well no slipping it is nice and bright so it stands out,22,106
4494,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,the quality is ok but look not exactly the same as photo the case is not as tranparent as what being shown in photo,24,107
4495,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,great price i paid half of what i expected to pay at a local store 20 for this case it shipped super fast and is still in great condition after more than a month of heavy use i definitely recommend screen protector sleeves as this case has an open front it does protect the front edges of the phone although overall great simple product for a better price than you can find at any local store,77,108
4496,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,perfect case for my phone it is just the right amount of protection and is not bulky whatsoever only down fall is that i am not sure i can put the case on the phone over a screen protector without the corners peeling,43,109
4497,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,so initially i was discouraged to buy this product from what some of the reviews said others had said that the case was not completely clear but when the phone is actually in the case it looks completely clear what they were referring to was that when the case is off the back part of the case looks a bit cloudy but you can not notice that on the phone like i said other than that i thought the case was pretty good one minor issue is that the cut-out for the silent switch on the side of the phone does not line up perfectly with the switch i actually had to cut out a small piece so that the case would be more flush against the phone and so that i could access the switch much easier overall it looks good,140,110
4498,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,so i got the case super excited about it i have a white iphone 4 from verizon so i wnated a case that would show that i acutally had a white iphone this is a good case fits snugly but it does not quite line up with the buttons on my phone volume buttons are ok but the slider button is a little covered also this case is not totally transparent like the picture shows it is kind of off white and has almost a frosted look to it other than that i like the case and I am going to keep it,99,111
4499,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i like the way the case fits but it does interfere with my screen protector and causes it to bubble the buttons never did work right for me it seemed almost too snug my only real complaint is that it is not clear like i thought it would be and it even started yellowing after about a week making it look really really cheap it is a nice material and protects well but overall I am not too satisfied with the aesthetics,80,112
4500,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i was so bummed when i got this and it did not align with the buttons on my iphone 4 it did not say when i bought it that it was only for the at t phone and i wish it had so annoying why they do not all match to begin with is beyond me but this was a waste of time,59,113
4501,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this is a simple design that shows off the apple iphone 4 design and yet still protects it the rubber buttons on the side are robust but do become easier to press after a few days of using them really this is just what i wanted apart from one small problem when the case is in position and all the button protectors are covering their corresponding buttons and the cut-aways for the camera the ear phone jack and the charging adaptor are also in position the cut-away for the quick silent mode switch is slightly out of line and makes it difficult to use it is not the biggest obstacle to overcome admittedly but does seem like a pointless oversight an otherwise perfect iphone 4 protector belkin grip vue tint case for ipod touch 4 g clear,138,114
4502,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,the search is over you can rest now delete all those links you have saved up for the perfect case this one might not be perfect but it certainly comes very close it is simple basic in it is design but that is exactly what i want from a case it fits very well an iphone will never slip out of this case has a matte finish which gives it a good grip and limits the scratches or at least makes the tear / normal usage bearable to look at yes it does provide a bit of difficulty when it comes to pressing the volume or the lock button but this is resolved over time the more you use it the easier it gets do yourself and your iphone a favor and get one,134,115
4503,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this cover fits nicely and is a nice fairly priced cover it also helps distinguish my black iphone from my wifes white iphone great delvery on shipping as well,29,116
4504,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,this case is amazing it got here in 1 1/2 days it is cheap also it fits very snug around the phone and offers a lot of protection another thing is that it is very stylist and great looking case does not affect flash or cameras would buy again if needed,48,117
4505,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i love this case one of the reasons i got the white iphone 4 was because of how pretty it was and this clear belkin case shows it off it also adds just the right of support that i wanted does not add any bulk and barely feels as if there has anything on the phone buy this you will not be disappointed,61,118
4506,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i received this case in the fall from apple when there were issues with reception in the first round of iphones i like it very much and other members of my family have since purchased these cases as well I have had it for almost nine months have dropped the phone a couple times and had no issues pictures I have taken are clear and have no glare on them what i like best about it is that it allows you to see the beauty and form of the iphone since it is clear without hiding it in rubber or colored plastic of course if you are really hard on your phone maybe you need more padding but this case will help the phone survive a couple drops with a minimum of scratches,130,119
4507,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i have tried many iphone cases and i keep going back to this one not only does it protect your phone it is very low profile the case does not attract lint at all and slips into pockets with ease yet is flexible i hate hard cases they always come apart when you drop the phone when i have dropped it it protects my phone perfectly as it bounces off the ground yes the volume and sleep button are covered but they do not interfere with the operation at all as they are not stiff unlike a lot of cases out there this one is not going to scratch your phone one review said they thought it was purple tinted yet they found it to be more purple nowhat that means the case is a see-through purple meaning that you can see the apple logo on the back of the phone but it is clearly purple i tried it on a friends white iphone and i did not like the look of it but then again i do not like the white iphone she however loved how it looked for me it is the perfect shade of purple not too dark not too light belkin did make an error in making this case it does not matter if it is at t or verizon black or white at the top of the phone in the middle it does not sit perfectly flush but is only noticeable if you are looking for it,249,120
4508,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this case works great i bought it for my white iphone 4 it is easy to grip and does not slip out of my hands the bumper protects the screen in case you do drop it which i have the phone was perfectly protected the only problem is that this model might have been made for the at t version and i have the verizon model the button coverings are not perfectly aligned because of this notably the mute switch on the left side of the phone where the cut out is slightly off i do not see this as a big issue i can still slide it where i need to but this was the only reason i did not give it five stars i want to also point out that the case is not completely clear it is slightly frosted this also does not bother me but it should be noted in case that is what you are looking for,154,121
4509,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this case works great for the price the only problem i have with it is that my silence switch is slightly covered but it is still very easy to move,29,122
4510,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,perhaps it is because i have the verizon iphone versus the at t version but this does not fit the phone well yes it stays on but it does not wrap the edges too snugly they pull away the case is flexible i had trouble with the front edges pulling away at some points yet it would peel my screen protector off at some corners ringer slide button recess did not line up too well and the phones volume buttons actually pushed the case away from the phone which did not get much better when i literally used an x-acto blade to make recesses over the volume buttons material also gets caught up in pants pockets hard to pull out without pulling entire pocket lining out maybe wearing silk-lined pants is a way around this just a horrible case in my experience is not there just a simple clear hard plastic case out there for the iphone 4,148,123
4511,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,the product was easy to put on but came with an issue when i tried putting the case onto my iphone it fit snuggly but a problem arose the plastic above the lock button continuously pushed down into the lock button which made it stuck i ended up cutting that part off so there is a hole in which i can push down the lock button aside from that problem it is a cheap efficient case,76,124
4512,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i have the iphone for verizon in white this case fits ok but the side volume buttons and the mute slider do not fit right,24,125
4513,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,the case does what it is supposed to do because it protected my phone from occassional falls but it is no longer clear after 2 years it is a nasty yellowedi assume due to sunlight exposure but it is so ugly now I am now on here trying to find something better i would not get it if you want it to stay clear and colorless eww,66,126
4514,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i purchased this case because i wanted a clear rubber case to protect and showcase my brand new white iphone 4 now that I have received it i am disappointed in it for a couple of reasons first and foremost the fit is bad the opening for the silence button on the left side of the phone is positioned too high making it difficult to use the switch it also bows out at the top bottom and sides which detracts from the straight streamlined look of the new iphone 4 this also causes an annoying click whenever i grip my phone as the top lip of the case slides back over the edges of the phone secondly the picture of the case that is displayed for thismakes the back look completely clear but it is frosted it makes my phone look dull and you can hardly see the silver apple through it i am keeping it to use when i exercise while carrying my phone because it is very sturdy and will offer great protection if i drop it but for everyday use i will order something different for both looks and convenience what has the point in having a white iphone if you carry it around in a case that diminishes it is looks,214,127
4515,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,this case is great however it does not fit the iphone 4 for verizon so steer clear it is unfortunate that the description does not mention that anywhere,26,128
4516,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,after nearly a year well maybe 3/4 year my case is still nice and clear no scratchy lines i like this case because is is strong thin and light it is almost not there that is what i want,37,129
4517,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,first thing you should know although it is not apparent in the picture here the case is not really clear it is more of a cloudy white the look is not that bad but if you are looking for a crystal clear case this is not it some pros good grip seems to stay clean protects the buttons and it is still easy to use the buttons ie onn / off volume the sides come up a little higher than the surface of the phone which translates into less chance of scratches on the screen and it is a good price cons it is a tad loose on the sides you can still squish them in a bit again the cloudy,113,130
4518,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i looked at the reviews before purchasing this product and must say it is a good buy I have had a few cases before this one and this one rates at the top i had a two piece case to start with which came with the phone from at t and i liked it until i dropped my phone and broke the case the case did do it is job although and the phone was not hurt so i could not complain at all and it was free the next case i purchased was a rubber glove case that fit excellent and i liked it real well until i put it into my pocket and when i went to use the phone the case was covered with fuzz and more this case does not collect lint and it bulks up the phone just enough to make it fit my hands well the phone is too small for me to grip well and i wanted something to protect the phone and make it a little larger this case is perfect for me and i do not have to worry about dropping the phone hope this helps,186,131
4519,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,this cases covered button areas constantly engage the power / sleep button rendering the design utterly useless i tried cutting holes over those areas to prevent it but ended up just throwing it out what a waste,35,132
4520,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,bought this at bestbuy for 20 case fits great for att iphone 4 volume buttons line up and are easy to use power button is also covered and works fine silence switch is not covered is a little harder to access but not a big deal headphone jack opening is right for the iphone headphone but might not work for other headphones that have larger plugs sync connection is exposed properly no problems with the different sync cables i use camera and flash are also exposed but i did notice a little reflection with the led flash sometimes not all the time might depend on the distance of the object you take a picture of front of the iphone has some protection with the ridge of the case so you safely put the iphone down face first all in all i am very happy case seems to protect the phone did not test it and looks great by not being very visible the case is pretty thin and i can still use my car iphone window mount,177,133
4521,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,the case fits the iphone 4 well the phone does not slip out of the case the case looks good on the phone and the case does not add much bulk to the phone which is very nice i do not like have additional weight on top of the phone the clear look allows the owner to still enjoy the crisp and sharp design of apple the case works well with the zagg anti-glare screen cover,74,134
4522,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,the worst devise it was defective and the return policy attrocious no repsonse from amazon or it is subsidiaries what a sharm i will never buy anything else from amazon ever does not fit properly,34,135
4523,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i just got it and it feels great makes the volume and power buttons easier to push i thought it would be completely clear and it is slightly frosted but i think the decal will show thru no problem,38,136
4524,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,nine and a half months pregnant after having my iphone a little over a week i accidently ran it through an entire wash cycle i followed a friends advice and immediately threw the phone in a ziplock bag of rice to absorb moisture for a day i charged it and it started right up i think it was this case that made the difference not only did it shield the phone when it was agitating and spinning but it covered all the seams in the phone i had the extra battery case before this and it was to bulky for me so glad the iphone was wearing this in time this case is definitely worth the price and then some this is the first product review I have ever written this story just had to be told,135,137
4525,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,i accidently bought this about 2months ago a wrong cover the next day the phone was dropped 5 feet from the hard floor but the did not even have a dent or scratch it is a good protected cover but does not look attractive at all,46,138
4526,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,very tight fit looks nice on the iphone itself but if you have a screen protector it is going to give you problems,22,139
4527,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,as an iphone 3gs and ipad owner i have long been aware of the quality of belkin cases they fit perfectly protect the device inside from external influences i recently took my 7-month-old ipad out of it is belkin case to clean it off and it still looks literally brand-new and i think they simply do their job and are not too bulky either i have no problems getting my phone in and out of the front pocket of my jeans although it would obviously be even easier without a case and i really like the fact that the case juts out above the display just enough so that if you lay the phone on the table face-down the display does not touch whenever i hold my iphone without the case i feel like i need to hold it with two hands because it might slip and fall the belkin case on the other hand has a nice grippy feel to it which is reassuring it also just feels better-made than similar cheap cases my uncle and brother each have the iphone 4 with a similar but much cheaper clear no-name case and you can really tell the difference it is not incredibly stylish just a plain clear plastic but sorta rubbery case that does it job as i have yet to drop my iphone 4 i can not say anything about the actual level of protection it offers but it seems sturdy enough what else can i say it is a good case and i do not think you will be disappointed,256,140
4528,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,3.0,neutral,seller says clear case but it is not clear it is actually frosted so theis not as described or pictured it is just a few bucks so no big deal but if you say clear that is what it should be,41,141
4529,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,exactly what i was looking for slim fitting not the hard brittle plastic and does not get super linty in a pocket love it even more because it is purple friend has the smokeand blue one looks pretty cool too,40,142
4530,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,this case does what it is supposed to do protects the phone from minor falls and helps me to grip the phone that iphone 4 is a slippery sucker without making it too sticky to slide into a pocket i agree with other reviewers that the volume buttons are stiff but mine are getting better over time about the look i like the purple helps me to distinguish my phone from my husbands when both are on the counter but it is not too colorful or tacky for my business lifesteyle and 40-something tastes and it does let the apple logo show through if that matters to you if you are someone who likes to make a statement with your phone case this probably is not the one for you but if you want a nice case for antenna stability and protection this one does the job,146,143
4531,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,i like that it is smooth enough to slip in and out of your pocket easily but still has some grip to it love the translucent purple i am giving it 4 and not 5 stars because it does not fit perfectly on my iphone 4 the top and bottom are not completely snug there has a slightfortunately it is not very noticeable,64,144
4532,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i looked at numerous case options for my iphone 4 including buying and returning several cases this case sounded like a good one from the amazon description it turned out to be absolutely perfect for my needs it is a soft plastic semi-transparent case covering the back sides and just enough in front to protect the face from touching any flat surface that it it placed an added bonus is the covered volume and top buttons the case also does not deter from the aesthetic good looks of this phone,90,145
4533,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,i think overall this is a great case especially since it is under 15 once it is on the phone it appears more purple than the picture would have you believe not as dark the surfaces are grippy enough so that you feel confident that the phone will not slip out of your hands while talking but it also slides easily into your pocket the only negative is that the volume buttons are hard to press with the case on i have to use my nails in order for it to work my case was shipped quickly and it was in new condition unlike another reviewers experience i recommend this case for anyone looking for an affordable colored iphone 4 case,119,146
4534,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,if you have any sort of screen protector on it do not buy this case it will bubble it severely not to mention if you have a screen shield on it will not properly aline with buttons and the power will be impossible to press,45,147
4535,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i wanted this case since i pre-ordered my iphone 4 but it was not available yet and then it was on backorder from belkins website but luckily on amazon they had it and it was way cheaper too i love it,40,148
4536,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,so the case itself is fine but the description says clear case and i got a purple one i basically wasted 10 bucks the least someone should expect is getting what they order,32,149
4537,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,the case is niceis cool not all surfaces are grippy so it slides easily into my pocket and with time does not seem like it would strtch,28,150
4538,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,this new iphone case arrived used it was scratched and scuffed and appeared to be repackaged there are too many other choices to risk the hassel of buying this one,30,151
4539,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i can not think of any thing to carp about this case i have been using this for quite some time now overall an excellent case both from utility and looks point of view,33,152
4540,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i received this case from apple as part of their free iphone 4 case program my screen cracked the one time i dropped my phone in this case i was walking with the phone in the cup holder of a stroller when i went over a bump and the phone flew out it fell about 3 feet onto the ground the case had a few nicks in it from the fall but my screen is cracked along the whole length please do not ever buy this case get a rubber one that goes around the front of the phone it is not designed well and it will not absorb the shock of a fall but will transfer it to your phone which will break as mine did,127,153
4541,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,case is great easy to take off and on super durable and the no-stick feature is pretty sweet highly recommend,21,154
4542,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,i ordered this case as the freebie offered by apple initially i liked the case although the case produced bubbles on the back side where i put a zagg skin much to my surprise however i did the cover the antenna with your hand and was shocked when my antenna connection dropped just like when it was naked three bars down to two bars down to one bar i can not recommend this case,73,155
4543,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i originally bought the clear version of this case for my new iphone 4 and was happy at first after using the clear case for a few days i ran into a few problems including the buttons were almost impossible to press especially when docked the camera flash would not work in the case due to glare after a couple weeks the case already looked yellow i returned this case when i found out that a smoked version was being released we are very happy with the smoked and purple versions beside those issues the case works great the rubber is not too soft as to get caught up in your pocket but stays put on slippery surfaces like a table or dashboard i loved seeing my new phone is complete detail but the trade off for the darker colors are worth it trust me as someone who has been down this road consider the other colors first,155,156
4544,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,nice looking case actually shows some of the nice-looking phone inside it rather than the bulky ugly plastic apple bumpers but it is really really hard to press the volume up / down or power buttons i gave up with it and threw it away,44,157
4545,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i really liked this case when it was in the packaging it is clear so i get to see my beautiful iphone but if you plan on putting a screen protector on like zags invisible shield then do not buy it this case is always pushing up against the screen protector creating huge air bubbles and driving me crazy I am getting a new case from incipio that looks like it will cover the edges where this will not happen anymore good luck,80,158
4546,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,i just picked up the belkin vue grip yesterday from best buy and love it it fits perfect and does not cover up my iphone 4s beautifully designed case i almost did not buy it because of what people were saying about the case making it difficult to push the different buttons but i am not having this problem at all maybe belkin fixed it i am very pleased with the look and feel of the material and the fact that it does not bulk up my iphone the only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that with the case on i can not put the phone in it isor attach it to my bose soundfathers day present from wife and kids i do not blame belkin as much as i blame themanufacturers because the vue grip fits so tight it makes it a little difficult to take off every time i want to listen to music through the soundlike i said although other than that i love it,178,159
4547,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,i bought two of these cases and promptly returned both the design of the case makes it very difficult to line up the buttons including volume and power to make then usable while it did offer great protection the fit was not there for me i attempted to put the case on 5 times to get it to line up properly and each time one or both set of the buttons were rendered useless you can tell it was manufactured prior to the actual phone being released due to the slightly off cuts in the plastic,95,160
4548,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i have not had any issue with what others are saying about the buttons being hard to press this case is very slim and protective I am not usually a fan of silicone cases in fact i thought this one was hard plastic when i bought it but this case does not have the sticky feel that most silicone cases have sometimes that makes it hard to slide in and out of my pockets but not with this one another problem with other silicone cases is that the sides seem easy to peel away from the phone real easily this case has a stiffer tight fit so that this does not happen the front of the case also has a bit of a lip to it so that when you set it face-down the screen is not touching the table in summary this is a very low-profile and protective case that adds a little bit of style to the phone i have not had any trouble plugging in any of my accessories designed for my old 3gs or other ipods either edit i see now that it is actually made of thermoplastic polyutherane tpu I shall be looking for cases made of this material in the future a nice blend of silicone and plastic properties,207,161
4549,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,i have the purple one and it looks great the fit is perfect and i have no issues accessing ports or buttons the plastic is just grippy enough to make it feel secure in my hand but i can also easily slip it into my pants pocket if it was released in more fun colors I had buy them too,59,162
4550,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,although the design and material used for this case are good the case does not fit properly it is way too loose simply placing the phone in your pocket and taking it back out will because the case to come off,41,0
4551,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,i like the look of this case and it does add extra grip but as others have stated it just fits too loose i thought i was going to have to stretch it a bit to put it on but it just slides in and out with little to no effort also the sides are way too thin i will definately be looking for a different one,66,1
4552,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,i bought this case to provide my shiny new handset with some grip and protection i ordered direct from amzer because amazons shipping projection at the time was between 1 and 3 months and i did not want to wait coming out of it is packaging the case feels nice enough but as another reviewer stated and i can now confirm the case fits too loosely i was expecting to have to pull or tug one or more corners of the case to fit my phone in but the phone just drops right in with no effort needed this is not a good thing and it does not inspire confidence that the case is securely holding the phone so what did amzer get right the cutouts for the camera speaker micro usb and a couple of others are perfectly aligned i have no problem sliding the micro usb cover through the cutout i like the added thickness of the material around the corners and back too it is a rugged almost armored look that is a stark contrast to the sleekness of the device sans case preferences on the aesthetic will widely differ but i like the look let us see what else they could have raised the material on the power switch and volume rocker a little more to provide the user with better tactile clues about their positions amzer got some of the design right but all in all this case is too loose it does not fit the phone right and i do not recommend it,251,2
4553,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,purchased the case through amzer upon putting my phone in the case i noticed that this case was not very form fitting i can literally drop my phone into this case without having to stretch it out and more when in my pocket the case is constantly falling out and because of it is loose fit it is letting debris settle into the case this was the worst case i have purchased in a long time if i could give negative stars i would amzers customer service is also piss poor they never emailed me back despite the numerous emails i sent them,101,3
4554,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,this is an amazing case just got it yesterday considering that there is not alot of cases made yet for this phone this is an exception to start with simple yet elegant I have posted two pics showing the front and back notice the wavy texture and look it compliments the phone the feel is great and it does not slip in your hands like most silicone cases that have no texture just smooth and looks boring the thickness of the case is apporximately 1/16th of an inch or 15 mm and it does not feel bulky at all i would recommend it,98,4
4555,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,just got my amzer case and i have to say that i really like it it fits really well and the phone does not jostle around in the the case it looks good and the design is nice the rubber / textured design on the side makes for good grip very nice,49,5
4556,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,the plastic is very bad made quality the design does not even fit on a vibrant samsung phone i had this is just fail buy,24,6
4557,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,the case was extremely durable for the entire time i had it but it did not fit the phone properly if you are looking for a case that fits your phone correctly I had suggest a better model,35,7
4558,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,the silicone cover is okay not great but adequate it is fine for the money but does not offer the phone too much protection,22,8
4559,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,not a bad case good price protects well but a little too loose of a fit for me and i did not end up using it for too long before finding another case,32,9
4560,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,it has been a year worth of drops and falls has taken a lickin and keeps on ticken does not add to much size to the vibrant itself great case,30,10
4561,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,the case looks as it does on the picture but it is much harder then i had imagined also it does not fit my device perfectly the top edges off of my phone and it does not have a secure feeling i would not recommend this product,45,11
4562,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,thiswas great it is everything i hoped it would be and work exactly for what i wanted and deffinitly needed for the safty of my phone laughing out loud greatand very durable and plenty of shock resistence if dropped plan on getting another for my wife and shipping was great thank you very much,55,12
4563,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,it is a really nice case with looks and texture quality i end up paying 15 with shipping and tax which is a lot money for this case including everything this case should cost around 6 - 7,36,13
4564,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,4.0,positive,the product is good and worth the value I am using the product with no issuesamzer silicone skin jelly case for samsung vibrant t959 samsung galaxy s 4 g sgh-t959v grey,33,14
4565,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,i read the reviews on this and i wanted to cancel right away unable to do so i recieved the case and put it on my vibrant to my surprise it fits like a glove i immediately threw out the case i got for five dollars on amazon because this one is excellent in every way the inserts are perfect for headphones and usb and volume and power buttons i can operate the entire phone while it is in the case great product,84,15
4566,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,i ordered this case for my samsung galaxy s 4 g phone and it does not fit securely it falls off the phone constantly and is not what i expected,29,16
4567,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,this was just a plain black case i got it because i like tocoordinate and black goes with everything i not to fond of jelly cases but i found it more nicer when i went out,38,17
4568,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,it is definitely nice but it does not fit snugly at all slips off easily but for the price i guess you get what you pay for but i definitely would not recommend it,31,18
4569,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,4.0,positive,it is rather large does not hold the phone securely but does work well in conjunction with a hard case and does not block the front camera like many others,27,19
4570,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,this case has outlasted the phone i have replaced the vibrant twice for manufacturers defects but this silicone case is great,21,20
4571,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,looks nice and does fit but i was hoping for something a bit more snug around my phone it is pretty thin and can be taken off easily which can be a good or bad thing depending on your preference love the gripping on the sides but i stopped using it because the case kept coming off now looking for another,61,21
4572,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,i was looking for a case for my new samsung vibrant phone that did not have a slick surface so as to not slide easily out of my hand or slide easily off any surface i might set it on like my car console or dashboard and for a case that fit the phone snugg enough the silicone keeps the phone intact on any surface but the case fits loosely onto the phone itself and easily comes off thus not protecting the phone from bumps scrapes or drops wish i would have returned it but the shipping costs to return was not worth it and my buddy bought me a better fitting case instead,112,22
4573,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,5.0,positive,at first use yes i also thought this cover seemed loose but i never have had a problem with the phone falling out of the case it sticks remarkably well insite this jelly case all day long i stick it in my shirt pocket and pull it out and the phone does not slide out i really like how the back side of this case sticks to my dash of my car very well and does not slide around even in my bouncy vehicle on pot-hole ridden northern us highways the case is very thick and because of that it also protects the camera lens very well yes i noticed that the case fits loosely around the phone but that has never been a problem for the past month as the phone has never fallen out of this case sleeve the price has dropped because of the poor reviews i paid 999 for it thought that was a great bargain would suggest you buy and try have recommended this to my good friends,174,23
4574,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,thislooks different on line than real life i was very disaapointed with it upon arrival and i sent it back immediately viai always count on amazon for good products so please review your stuff carefully and price it accordingly i have a much better and less expensive skin cover from t-mobile store in the mall which supposed to be more expensive thanks bashar abdelfattah,67,24
4575,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,4.0,positive,i had some reservation ordering this product due to the negative reviews this product had i decided to order it anyway because it was only around 1000 i have been using it for around 3 days now it was not as bad as the other reviews made it out to be the case did not come off when i took the phone out of my pants pocket to answer the phone could the design be better yes it could i would have liked it to fit more tightly on the bottom two corners maybe i got lucky and got a case that was not as loose as the other reviewers got I am satisfied with the case it does what it was meant to do and that is to offer some protection in case you dropped your phone,134,25
4576,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,i compared my case to the one my friend got from the t-mobile store and i liked his much better mine was too flexible and flimsy where as his was much more secure and you could not move it around as much,41,26
4577,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,thebehind this is very good create a silicone style design for the case so that if you drop it shock travels away from the phone the only problem is that this skin does not fit securely over the phone and moves around,44,27
4578,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,the good silicone case looks nice which is what i initially liked about it it has also protected my phone in two occasions of some nasty falls so with this said i am happy with the product the bad freakin thing should have been a little bit smaller so it can hold the phone in when I am pulling out of my pocket of out of my case overall i like it but thought it should be a bit smaller,79,28
4579,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,the very short answer here is if you own a samsung vibrant or other samsung galaxy s phone this silicone case is much too loose i purchased this one and the cheapo-cheapo no name silicone one for about 2 the amzer virtually falls right off while the cheaper one is significantly snugger but actually not quite perfect either with the amzer stick your phone in a pocket the case falls off put it just about anywhere it is in contact with any but smooth smooth surfaces and it just falls off the cheapo-cheapo no name brand fits slightly better if you have found a better one out there please let me know so i can try it,116,29
4580,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,if you are looking for a slick case like me then you will be quite disappointed i have an ipod touch with a silicone case and it works perfectly so i think it is not that hard for someone to create one for the vibrant it fits on ok but the anti-slip seems to abit over the top and i was having problem taking it in and out of my pocket without the phone actually slipping out of the case after using it for awhile i would mostly leave the case out instead 2 stars as it does protect the phone with what it seems quality material but fail on practical daily use at least for me,116,30
4581,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,i purchased this hoping it would help protect my vibrant however it it is constantly slipping off i gave up using it as my old g1 sleeve protects the phone much better,32,31
4582,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,1.0,negative,like most of the people reviewing this product i too noticed that it was way too loose on my phone i tried calling them and i was on hold forever i then emailed them and they requested i take some pictures i did not think taking pictures would make sense so i took the video instead and replied to tech support i asked for either a refund where they paid for return shipping if they wanted it returned or an exchange for a case which fit correctly they never replied to my second message the case itself feels great if it fit correctly i think i would really like it since they have not replied i decided to post this video as an amazon review in addition i contacted my credit card company and had the charge removed i would also encourage other people that have the same problem who have purchased this case to contact amzer if amzer does not respond or refuses a refund or exchange please call your credit card companies and have the charges removed contact amzer first although and make sure you have documentation regarding your attempted contact with amzer it is the only way to get amzers attention if they do not respond directly within a timely manner otherwise they have no incentive to fix the problem it may only be 1500 but that does not make it ok for them to sell a product which obviously is not what people expected call your credit card company,261,32
4583,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,2.0,negative,this was the only case i could find for my vibrant unfortunately it did not live up to expectations pros feels soft looks good cons too loose comes off when removing from pocket,32,33
4584,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,looks very nice corner and rear thickness is a good design the sides are thin but would not make contact anyway from a simple fall the thick parts would take the damage easy to take on and off by pressing the insides of the shoulder since a drop would not press on this area it is very unlikely that the case will fall off if anything a drop would push the case back on strangely does not cover the chrome rim on the top and bottom this gives the illusion that it is not on all the way and that it will fall off it will not but it is still unsettling everywhere except the corners are flimsy and move a lot making it feel much less snug nothing lifting the speaker off of a surface without a case the speaker grate is bent slightly to allow sound out this case lays flat however unless laid on it is face sound is practically muted overall it is one of the few cases for the vibrant out there and it is very pretty however it was manufactured to fit based on the dimensions of the phone so there are no extra / custom design features that make this case unique to this phone as a result it does not provide the necessary quality expected such as enveloping the chrome rim and allowing noise to escape when laid face up i gave this case 3 stars although because for it is price it does provide adequate protection for people who do not treat their phones like garbage but also for people who do not want to baby their phones,265,34
4585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,bought this for my i pod 5th generation since the audio jack was broken works great sound quality is also great downside needed volume control headphones on the bright side my phone charger works with this device d,38,0
4586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i got a used ipod touch 2 g only to find that the headphone jack is on the fritz figuring this to be a common problem i opted to keep the ipod instead of return it there are a number of solutions for the problem which include replacing the headphone jack self repair or shop repair or get an audio solution that utilizes one of the ipods features bluetooth wireless headphones or speakers which can be expensive but nice or find an audio line-out that plugs into the connection pins at the bottom of the device i have a sonoma audio device that works just fine for this purpose it seems a little bulky sometimes the adapter i am reviewing here is much smaller and less obtrusive but it has a couple of caveats first when plugged into the ipod the volume can not be adjusted with the ipods volume controls you need to have a volume control on your headphones or on the device you are connecting to or use an app that features volume control also it appears that it does not function as a mic-in at least not with the mini-mic i tried on the whole i think it is worth the price easily you just need to know that you will need to have a way to control the volume since the ipod volume control will not function,229,1
4587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this product works very well however you must handle it with care mine cracked open after handling it a little roughly,21,2
4588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,seeing how few reviews there are for this great product i felt compelled to write a fair and honest review this little adapter is so worth the money i never realized the headphone jack on my ipod touch audio was not optimal i previously had purchased the monster thximini8 1/8 stereo to rca stereo adapter and thought the sound was clear but low volume i hate having to monkey with the volume on the ipod and the receiver i read online about using theconnector for audio but did not realize this micro usb adapter even existed let me tell you the sound is so much an upgrade and it is really easy to use just plug the micro usb adapter into your ipod plug in the headphone jack into the adapter and it even includes a usb input slot to keep your ipod charged while hooked up to your receiver how cool is that the adapter itself is shiny black maybe about half inch long and wide and simply works i originally was skeptical because of the low price and there is another one here that is priced much more and basically the same thing now the volume is controlled strictly by my receiver and has nothing to do with the ipod i do not know how durable it is but i do not plan to plug and unplug the adapter I am leaving it attached to my 1/8 35 mm adapter at all times and only plugging the combined micro usb line out and monster 1/8 to rca into my ipod whenever needed,260,3
4589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i bought this to enable charging an ipod touch in my car with a micro usb adapter and to improve the signal from the ipod to my tape adapter in my car stereo is device handles both of those tasks like a champ and for a great process making it a terrific value update it was too good to be true and broke not too much after i wrote the above even although i was very gentle with it sigh,80,4
4590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,I am a sound tech and a dj and my goal is to get everything down to mix / line level i do not have to worry about what the volume is set at i just hit play and that is it it is nice in an environment where people bring their ipods and people request for you to play a song i thought it was a little pricey for this adapter but it does exactly what i need,73,5
4591,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,usb did not work for power or transfer,8,6
4592,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,does not fit snuggly have trouble with it falling out unable to purchase anything similar to this in the store although thankful that it is available from amazon as my ipod would be worthless without it,36,7
4593,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,did not work as described at all money down the toilet another amazon scam,14,8
4594,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,technically it works but in practice it does not latch into the ipod connector and so is useless in a car,20,9
4595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,it has no latch so it is constantly getting pulled out of the idevice by the attached cables making it unusable in a car buy this only if the idevice you intend to plug it into and the cables plugged into it will not be moved while it is in use,51,10
4596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,falls out all if i move my ipodfound one made by fiio a couple months later from china real cheap that does not fall out all the time,28,11
4597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,i have two of these and love how they can be used with a bluetooth adapter to connect to my car stereo i now have bluetooth in my 1951 chevy pickup,31,12
4598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,it works great the only thing and i did not know this is that it overwrites the volume control in my ipad 2 so there is no way to adjust it it is one volume level for everything but i can live with that,40,13
4599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,easily is detached from ipod could have fixed with a simple clamp on the side also no volume control is available so it blares constantly on some songs and others not loud enough but it serves it is purpose,37,14
4600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,the only real problem i have with this device is that when you insert it into the pin connectors it seems to slip out of it rather easily and there is not anything to keep it locked on place which is not a problem if you are using light earbuds but i like to use big diaphram headphones and it tends to slip out other than that the quality is great and i am glad i made this purchase instead of spending more money on a new generation ipod,87,15
4601,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i was annoyed that the only way to tell which way is up is to try and connect it or to examine the orientation of the prongs once you have connected it once although you can just remember that the micro usb port on the back is oriented upside down from what you would expect it was missing that little symbol that you find on apple connectors that let us you know the upside also it was not as tight fitting as I had like but connectors rarely are i guess it did perform as advertised i was able to use the line out to use my headphones as the audio jack on my ipod is toast for some reason i did not like that i lost all control over the volume but i was expecting that from other reviews so i went with the flow strangely the app i tried to use to boost the volume said there was no volume information I shall try another app only way to fix that permanently is to replace the audio jack which is a pain in the ass due to the way the ipod is put together really retarded to use glue instead of screws to hold the screen on i guess apple does not want you messing with their hardware yourself I am waiting for my battery to completely fail and I shall do just that at the same time I am also able to charge it and plug into my pc so that is mainly what i bought it for i received it in the allotted shipping time frame so i was satisfied with the purchase construction could be a little less cheap but you get what you pay for,279,16
4602,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i used this product to play my old i pod that wouldent work in my car with my aux plug it is a great product but please note that it is not a tight fit for the i pod and you may need to rubberband it to your device to get it to stay on i use this in my car so it does not bother me,66,17
4603,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,as everyone says it falls out but i thought I had keep it in with an attractive rubber band turns out this covers up the ports on it also most importantly the sound through it is terrible tinny no base sounds like it is coming through a can not a good choice if you plan on listening to music through it i ended up getting a kinivo bluetooth receiver for use in my car costs a lot more at 40 but works great give it a look,85,18
4604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i works very well and is a great solution if you ipods audio out port is broken or if you want to charge your ipod with an micro usb cable the only issue is that the connector lacks the side grips that most 30-pin cables have this causes the connecter to disconnect from the ipod if it is not moved carefully the other connections are very sound pun intended and hold up nicely moved other than that this connector was a great purchase and after a few months is still working for me great solution,94,19
4605,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,small and effective best describes this product better sound is achieved through this product with minimal distortion from the device,21,20
4606,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,it works well but this model pops out very easily look for one that stays in the port more securely,20,21
4607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this device is just what you would expect it sits very loosely in the port but it gets the job done i was hoping to be able to use it with my lifeproof iphone 4 case but it does not fit,41,22
4608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,been using this thing in my car for like ever works great especially if your headphone jack does not work anymore,20,23
4609,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,i got this because the earbud jack on my ipod broke if you are in the same boat do not get this you can not control the volume it is way too loud,30,24
4610,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,well since my regular headphones jack broke in my ipod video and repairing is not worth it i bought this little accessory to buy my ipod video some extra time before ending in the ipod cemetery-museum although the product works and theis very good these are the problems i have found the volume of the ipod does not control the headphone volume at all if you use this connection so there has only one setting of maximum volume by default that you can not change the connector itself is all the time coming out the ipod so the music stops suddenly this is specially annoying when you connect the ipod to the aux in the car or to run with the ipod in your pocket since every bump or minimum move makes the connector lose it is sound from the ipod something as simple as two little buttons on the sides to release the connector like some apple chargers have would have fix this looks like there has nobody working for the qa dept of this company the piece came out chipped on the side so not very happy with that either i have heard there are similar products that are better for a couple of bucks extra and comes with the side solution for the connection so do not buy this unless you want to find yourself annoyed by these issues every 5 minutes,234,25
4611,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,as others have mentioned 30pin side is a somewhat loose fit into my iphone 4 but it works just have to be careful not to have any pulling motion on the cable when in use product did do what i was looking for charge my iphone through a usb cigarette lighter adapter and provide output to my car aux input jack,60,26
4612,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,i bought two different ones since these were so cheap the other one i bought had a locking mechanism which keeps it from falling off when the wire is slightly pulled well i got what i paid for,38,27
4613,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i wanted to use to replace my headphones jack of my ipod but turns out you can not control the volume with this [ however it was cheap soooooo eh,29,28
4614,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,it was ok i can listen to my music the only down fall is it dose not clip in so i have to watch what I am doing while listening to it but other then that great plus i can charge it at the same time if need be with a cell phone charger which make it osm because i alwayz have the wire due to charging my cell,68,29
4615,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,pro lineout works and the device charges microusb attaches securely uses microusb con lacks latching tabs so this thing falls out easily like at the slightest provocation a little too big to use with most cases really needs the spring loaded tabs found on most charging cables in practice this is quite annoying to use,56,30
4616,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,my audio output is messed up bad thought of something like this amazon gave me this works great charger and all there was just one thing about it that is a little bit irritating you can not change the volume of your ipod or iphone when it is plugged in,48,31
4617,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,if you have an iphone or touch with a busted earphone socket and you are not into microsoldering this is the rig for you you may need an external volume control if you are feeding into an earphone and you will need a microusb charger it does not have the hooks to lock it into the 30 pin port i use scotch tape,62,32
4618,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,i mostly bought this because i only wanted to keep my microusb charging cable in my car i figured that with this plugged into my ipod i could just charge either it or my phone from the same cable sadly for whatever reason it caused my music to stop whenever i plugged or unplugged my ipod and the audio jack which i did not technically need did not have a nice tight fit so i took it out of my car and use the adaptor to charge my ipod in my living room it still gets two stars because i am still using it for something but i would not buy one again,110,33
4619,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,this adapter is exactly what it looks like it functions well is very durable and works with every idevice i own it is also a very quick fix for those pesky ipod headphone jack failures it seamlessly kept my ipod working in the car until i had time to fix the headphone jack,53,34
4620,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,accidental sent to my old address and they fixed it and it got to me super fast thank you so much my i pods head phone jack quit working instead of sending back to apple to fix it which could take forever and cost a ton i bought this and now my i pod is working great again thank you so much,61,35
4621,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,nice output good for use on home sustems without a dedicated ipod connection and with th enew generation mac products having a new connection it is well worth skipping the dedicated connection,32,36
4622,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,good option if your headphone jack stops working like mine did kinda dulls the sound a little but if you can not afford to go buy a new ipod this helps fix a broken port problem,35,37
4623,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,my daughter broke her headphone piece off in her ipod the piece was removed but you still could not use headphones we saw this and thought this was a cheaper solution than buying a new ipod she loves it she can hear her music again laughing out loud,45,38
4624,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this product is just alright it does a job but not very well this product comes out of my ipod / iphone a lot and the whole reason why i got this was because my 250 ipod classic was broke because the headphone jack was broken so i could not hear anything out of my headphones so i bought this and it works but not only does it come out of my ipod easily there is also no volume control so the music blasts through my headphones at 100 even when you turn the volume down or set a volume limit on the ipod so basically i am back to square one i would not reccomend this if you are looking for the same solution that i was but if you are looking for something to use through the car stereo then go for it,143,39
4625,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,thisworks as described i used this adapter on an ipad2 ipod touch 2 and 3 and an iphone 4s it worked on all devices there have been no problems wi the charging function depending on the type of device case there could be some interference i use a speck candycase for the phone and there was only slight interference the ipod touch 3 has an earlier version of a speck case and the thin plastic around the 30 pin connector broke the biggest complaint is that the adapter does not have the latches to secure it to the device and it can pop out if the device is moved while the adapter is in place,117,40
4626,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this works well if you are sitting still but if u are active this is a pain the device does not lock onto your apple product i manage using a little scotch tape to keep it on but beside physical problems ipod output jacks do not support it is main volume it is just plan loud i would recommend getting a volume control if you are going to use the head phone jack but i also recommending getting a adapter that can latches itself to the ipod even if cost just a little more,93,41
4627,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,i received this product 2 days before expected it works great i bought this as my ipods audio auxillary does not work on the left speaker unless i hold it in place this was a fabulous substitute also i realized that my phone charger fits the mini usb and charges the ipod also no need for the additional charger i love it i took it on a hike with my dogs as soon as i got it according to some previous reviews it comes out easily i was a little worried that it would come loose and I had lose it but it stayed put for the entire 1 hour walk up the hills and through the woods it was great i really do not think that it is loose at all i love it,132,42
4628,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this is what i wanted and does the job reasonably well the only trouble is that unlike the apples adapter it does not has the catches on the plug and easily slip out,32,43
4629,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,this product does exactly what it is supposed to but it will not stay connected to my iphone there are no connecting tabs like with iphone chargers,27,44
4630,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this is an ok product it works fine but it does not allow for volume control i also wish it had the little locking tabs on the connector to hold it into the ipod would be a good buy if your headphones or listening device has it is own volume control,50,45
4631,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this product technically works for what i needed it to do which was to bypass my broken headphone jack however the volume is very low when i use this thing and it falls out really easily,36,46
4632,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,my xbs port for my headphones stopped working on one side it worked as a new port for them now i do not have volume controlsomething in the adapter is making my i pod nano do this i know this is true because the other port has volume controlbut i did have to pay a costly repair bill or replace it,60,47
4633,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,this is a good product but it does not allow you to control volume this sets it at full volume so the music gets really loud not the best solution for a broken headphone jack,35,48
4634,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,generally will not write reviews but was compelled to write reviews it would have been a great product if it would have stayed inside the connector it just comes out too often too easilty,33,49
4635,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,it may not be anything special it does the job obviously you can not control the volume out on the ipod adapters like this so if you are using headphones expect volume at full do not ever hit the adapter when plugged into the ipod mine bent and the prongs bent also nothing some tape will not fix,55,50
4636,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this connector does exactly what i hoped except for one annoying thing since it has the line out built-in it does not allow the headphone port to be used i bought this to reuse my micro usb connector for my old palm pre it does that just fine but i also use a wired headset when talking in the car i hate bluetooth headsets do not like having another thing to charge so this adapter messes with my setup otherwise the power adapter portion works great,84,51
4637,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this product is complete rubbish after 3 days of having it the thing stopped working no matter what iphone / ipod put it in the device would not register it being plugged in also there is no volume control it sticks out miles from the ipod and looks really cheep,47,52
4638,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,i purchased mine at amazon for 799 excellent product for that price it gives the user line out audio quality plus the ability to charge and sync the iphone / ipod device,30,53
4639,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this adaptor does not have the 2 pins on the sides that hold a typical cable into theconnector as a result the adpator is constantly falling out or the right audio channel stops or the left or no audio and the iphone speaker is activated you can not pick up the iphone or the adaptor will start slipping remember that the cables on the end weigh quite a bit this is worse than useless might even short out theoutput,82,54
4640,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,good for the money does the job got confused with micro usb connection i was expecting mini usb all good so far,22,55
4641,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,the headphone jack on my ipod touch quit working so i purchased this product to see if i would be able to use headphones again on my ipod and it worked,31,56
4642,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,i bought thisbecause my ipod headphone jack was broken beyond repair in fact i repaired it on multiple occasions only to have it break again thiswas appealing because it allowed headphones to be connected through the usb port this product is good if you want to connect your ipod to a stereo with it is own volume control with optimal sound in the case of headphones using thisdefeated the purpose because now my ipod is stuck on the highest volume setting possible with no way to adjust it so this is a good product for stereos but not for regular headphones now i am on the hunt for headphones with their own personal volume control unrelated to the ipod itself i doubt i will be able to do this so a new ipod is now on my wishlist,143,57
4643,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this did not work with my daughters itouch we plugged in a pair of headhphones into the new adapter and it worked but there has no way to control the volume going into the headphones the volume was full blast and there was no way to lower it the adapter disables the itouch volume controls the volume was on high and she could not even wear headphones because it was too loud it would have been nice if the product description stated this fact very disappointed,84,58
4644,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,this was just what i was looking for and more all i wanted was something tiny that would allow me to only carry one charging cable with me i use an android phone that takes a micro usb charger and i wanted to be able to charge my ipod on the go too this does the job perfectly it also allows me to play music in a much better quality then the standard headphone jack for plugging my ipod into a stereo if you need either a charging adapter or a eq free audio jack then buy this adapter the only down side at all is there is no latch to hold the adapter into the ipod this is not a big deal for in your car or on a desk but in your pocket it can because this adapter to come loose i rate this a 9/10,148,59
4645,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,thisis great from a standpoint of never needing to pack an extra cable however fails in that it lacks any form of locking mechanism unlike the actual ipod / iphone cable this means that if the slightest tension pulls on your cable the connector will come loose and lose connection making it almost unusable as a carconnector,59,60
4646,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,my ipod aux port only plays 1 channel after so much use so i got this so that i can get both channels left right speakers to play in my car and charge my ipod with a micro usb port the same as my phone while i use a cassette adapter but i do not like this product much because you can not adjust the volume and because the connection to my ipod is flimsy not my ipods fault the products fault and it falls out easily update the unchangeable volume that it plays at I am going to is around 80 maximum volume in my cars both 2003 lexus es300 and 2001 is300 and probably most toyotas because toyotas make lexus this volume was too loud and distorted sound quality i was afraid this would damage my speakers in the long run and so i have stopped taking this thing around me and so this purchase was a waste of money for me the result of this product may not be the same for everyone who purchases it but i provide you with my case to help anyone out,186,61
4647,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,take the 799 you would spend on this and put it toward the sendstation pocketdock if you look at this thing the wrong way it will fall out of the iphonesit is totally unsecure a waste of money,40,62
4648,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i was looking for something like this convert my old palm pre micro usb data cable into a workable iphone 4 data cable this adapter does the job just fine it is not fancy nor does it lock in place like original iphone data cables but for the money and the ability so reuse an old cable from another phone is priceless now i can keep a data cable at work and one at home i have not tried the line out port and honestly I am not too sure what it is for i really do not have any use for it so i can not give any review on it hope this helps,111,63
4649,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,before getting thisi had been plugging a couple different stereos into the headphone jack of my ipad and ipod touch that worked ok but finding the right volume setting for the line-in connection could be a bit tricky now with this i do not worry about the volume of the ipad just the stereo it is easier and i think the sound quality is better,65,64
4650,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,moved to iphones from palm and bought two of thesemicro usb line out adapter connector for apple iphone 3 g 3gs iphone 4 ipad 2 ipod allows me to use my old car chargers and has the bonus of better audio out as well,46,65
4651,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i have purchased this adaptor to save the 35 mm jack in my iphone as i use it to connect to my old company car stereo that has no bluetooth support so by only plugging the charger connector i would be able to do both things charge iphone and listen to music with only one connection at first i thought that the sound quality would not change from one to other type of connection but the sound quality of the signal generated through the lower connector was awful distorted and the use of this connector disables iphone volume control as i have also carried out a test with a docking cradle that i could purchase locally with pretty much the same function with the same results i can not affirm that this is an issue of this product in particular but as far as i am convinced this kind of connection will not work properly for this type of use maybe there is some kind of configuration that should be carried out although my last shot will be a bluetooth adaptor i hope it works now as far as the product finishing and other quality aspects i have no concerns about it it looks good fits correctly and i have got none of those messages about the product being incompatible with iphone 4,222,66
4652,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,the adapter is well built and the micro-usb and phono jack ports work well but the appleconnector is built without the clips necessary to hold it into a device iphone 3gs for me this causes the adapter to pull out from the device with the slightest touch interrupting charging and music playback if you use this in the car like i did a sharp turn can even make it disconnect i would not use this adapter for any use where you need to hold your phone or pick it up it is only good for stationary settings like outputting to a stereo even then picking it up to pick a song will because it to disconnect,117,67
4653,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this is a realitively cheap solution when compaired to genuine apple brand accessories for a person wanting to add a line out jack on their ipod iphone as other posters have stated the 30-pin apple connector on this does not lock in place and easily falls out when being handled forget about mounting this thing anywhere it makes it dangerous in a vehicle due to the tempation to try and fix this while driving use some sense and wait until you stop to fix the plug or browse for a new song for that matter in any case you must provide you are own 1/8 stereo cable to connect to you are vehicles aux port on the stereo also you will need a 12v dc to usb micro charger if you intend to charge you are device asside from the very big problem of the adaptor falling out it works sounds pretty good and does charge just fine,156,68
4654,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,bought this adapter on a whim and it has not disappointed me it charges syncs and does audio as well it does not hurt that it is priced well and eliminates the need to have the iphone cable with me at all times great buy,42,69
4655,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,when i read the reviews of this adapter i have to say that it looked good so i decided to try it first looks were good the product was in good condition when i plugged it in to my ipod it worked fine problems i had you could not plug your headphones all the way in you had to put them about 3/4 of the way in also the connector does not lock in place this means that if it moves a little bit it will fall out of the ipod i would have been fine with it if it had the locking prongs and if it did not break within 10 minutes of listening to music I had have to say those were some of the worst 8 I have ever spent,129,70
4656,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,took a dremel to this unit since it would not fit into the apple iphone4 bumper but after that it works like a charm and for very little relative to other products,32,71
4657,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i bought thisto access the line out from my iphone you get better sound quaility from the line out than you do from the head phone jack when you use the headphone jack you are sending a signal that is meant for headphones and is variable so that you may increese or decrese the volume for the headphones when you plug something into your aux in on your stereo your stereo is set up to receive a line level input when you use thison your apple product iphone 4 in my case you will get a warning diolog box telling you that this is not normal you can dismiss this and listen to your music with better clarity the only difference is you can only control your volume from the stereo or amplifier itself the micro usb allows you to charge your phone with any standard usb to micro usb cable i would give it 5 stars if it had a solid wire coming out instead of having to deal with the micro usb connector the price is fair would be better if it was amazon prime no extra shipping costs,198,72
4658,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,my ipod took a spill down some stairs and the headphones bent the audio jack in such a way the connection was never complete causing some sounds to come through but not others i did some research and bought one of these guys to see if it would solve the problem since i can not really afford to have the ipod repaired it works great I had say the sound quality is actually better than before i would not hesitate to give this product a five star rating except for two things the product falls out a lot and wiggles in the slot and the lack of volume control required me to buy another cable i justtaped it in place and it works great,123,73
4659,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,i just got the package today which is a day earlier than what amazon notified me which is a plus the screen protector is not all that bad if you clean the screen carefully before you put the protector on when putting on the protector you should be careful but quick because if the side of the protector that contacts with itouch screen catches dust or anything it is almost impossible to remove it which means you need to use a second screen protector watch out for air pockets when you putting the protectorif you do mess up for the first time like me it is not a problem the package comes with 3 protectors i suggest buyers lay the protector starting on the home button side because it is easier that way to put it right in the middle of the touch keep in mind that the protector will leave athat is about a hair thick but that should not be a problem because you have a case talking about the case the black one to be honest sucks like help it has a weird trashy smell is kinda slippery and has a huge hole on the bottom for ear phone and and more that is so insecure it can not really hold the touch in place however the white one is a lot better it fits pretty well has a smaller bottom and does not slip off my hand like the black one does overall i do not think this is a bad purchase and do not regret buying it i got what i wanted and i hope this review helps,268,0
4660,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,screen protector had top layer sticker applied to both layers sticker glue not east to remove from actual screen protector rendering it unsightly case covers are a little thin and too loose-fitting compared to others i have purchased at radio shack,41,1
4661,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,looks cool and that is about it fits poorly attracts lint discarded it and bought a tpu type cover fast shipping tho,21,2
4662,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,this product is not 5 star but it is also not that expensive compared to some other things i have seen out there it came with the two silicon cases and 3 screen protectors the sillicon is not really tight fitting but the fit on mine is pretty good and will suit it is purpose help keep me entertained at work,57,3
4663,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,sometimes just sometimes you should believe what you read in the reviews this product is not worth the box it came in i took a gamble on it since it was so inexpensive er cheap epic fail the ipod touch is for my 13 year old for christmas no way in the world am i protecting it with one of these spend a little more and truly protect your investment look elsewhere,72,4
4664,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,both cases fit my ipod perfectly the clear silicone and black silicone cases were exactly thesize i expected putting on the screen protector was a little struggle but it looked great i recommend this to new ipod touch owners 4th generation other than the quality the product was shipped to my hands in only 2 days,59,5
4665,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,after getting thisthe case fits pretty well on the 4th generation model of the ipod touch you do not have to worry about dropping it however please be assured that the screen protection thisoffers is half baked i say that because there is only 1 screen protector and if you apply it wrongly too bad so sad you can not use it anyway it at least let us you not worry about dropping your precious ipod touch for the time being do not buy this if you need good screen protection,91,6
4666,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i thought this would be okay for my new g4 8 gig boy was i wrong it is not worth the shipping cost i suppose i am to harsh if you are planning to put this skin on and leave it in your drawer it would work just fine however if you want to take your touch with you get something else i took it golfing and the skin did not even stay on in my pocket if fits too loose to provide any real protection all in all it was very annoying and i am going to see if they will take it back keep shopping,105,7
4667,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i bought this as there was not much selection for the new 4 g touch the first one fell off all the time wneh you put it in your pocket and the bottom piece broke also it comes with a free screen protector but the first one only had one side to pull off and was defective easyi said they would send me a new one and refund my money if i removed my first review which i did to give them another chance the replacement came and it is the same thing and will not stay on the 64 gb ipod touch the second screen protector actually went on the touch but the holes do not line up and so it looks a little off i know that they should but it would not cover the screen properly if i lined them up correctly they did try to help me out with the replacement and the refund but i am still not happy with the end result i guess you get what you pay for but i will wait for something better,178,8
4668,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,i had lost my patients waiting for otter box to come for a case for the 4 g itouch i saw this for 399 and figured what the h it turns out to be a pretty good case to pr0tect it from scratches mine fits perfect and the clear membrane for the screen went on easy with out any bubbles i have paided up to 1500 for just the screen membrane from other companies and this one that came with the case was way superior,84,9
4669,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,shipping overall was good low price but I am not really sure how well silicone covers are supposed to work being that i dropped my ipod and the screen cracked probably my own fault since i did not do any research on it overall good product if you are not as clumsy as i am,52,10
4670,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,good cheap case lightweight and easy to handle maybe it is just me but i always struggle putting the screen protector on so that it actually looks right,27,11
4671,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,bought these cases because i had similar ones for my old 2nd gen ipod and they worked great does not offer the best protection although,24,12
4672,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,within the 1st week thisripped and did not work well the screen saver would not stick well to my ipod i had to tape it on the sides to keep the screen saver onwas very thin and had little to no protection for my ipod,49,13
4673,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for it collected a lot of dust just laying down on a table so i have to wash the case often and eventually i got too lazy,32,14
4674,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,i needed a case for my itouch these were okay they would not stay on they were a little loose but they were a good price so i can not complain that much,31,15
4675,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,there help keeping your ipod nice but are cheaply made they do not fit perfect so when you put them in your pocket the case often comes off,27,16
4676,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,nothing special about it it is all silicon so it will not stay on completely it is also difficult to slip into your pocket either way it is a nice throw away case,29,17
4677,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,these work okay if you are looking for a cheap option to help guard your ipod there is nothing fancy-pants about them the fit is not snug at all and becomes a little floppy over time if you have it in your pocket you might even have it slip out of the case works great if it is jostling around in your bag or briefcase,65,18
4678,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,both of the cases stayed on perfectly fine for me I am using the black one now the only reason this did not get 5 stars is because i only received one of my two screen savers,35,19
4679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,these cases are great they fit perfectly and protect my ipod touch 4th generation and look great it is one of the best deals ever the price is great and it came with a screen protector and cleaning cloth great product i highly recommend it,45,20
4680,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,my full review of the twin pack case for ipod touch 4th generation via amazoncom as of today it is selling for 247 with free shipping you will receive one black and one clear silicone case a plastic screen protector and a micro cloth these are very durable reliable and beautiful cases for such a low price you are saving around 88 when you purchase via the link below you get more than you are paying for as well my black silicone case did come with a small cut on the left side but otherwise the case is flawless my white silicone case came without any imperfections but seem to become sticky and does not feel right in the hand both cases provide lay-on-the tablet protection but beware since it is very little and made out of silicone material the screen protector works very well and provides a matte design and only attracts little fingerprints the micro cloth gets the job done it is not the worst but still again not the best overall i recommend this twin case kit to everyone the price is right and the cases are worth it,187,21
4681,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,it is okay but in reality it attracts lots of gunk makes your ipod dirty and is not very easy to slip into your pocket I am not even really sure to what extent it protects my ipod,35,22
4682,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i like the material but it does not stay together on my ipod the reason y i bought it was so that my new ipod would be safe in case of being dropped i had to get another protective case for my ipod,42,23
4683,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,this is a late review my apologize but still was an excellent purchase a quickly shipping process and a very good price i will recommended thanks a lot,30,24
4684,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,well it is damn cheap and affordable durrable if want something with quality and a great price here it is fits right and no problems,24,25
4685,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,i had originally purchased this product with the expectation that it would protect my new 4th generation ipod touch unfortunately it did not the cases are really loose on my ipod and once i put them in my purse or backpack the case would come off although the screen protector was alright i was not very satisfied with how the cases fit on my ipod i guess if you are looking for a case to just have around your ipod to avoid minor scratches on it then this case will work just fine i would not recommend this product for someone who is looking for a case to stay on and protect your ipod,114,26
4686,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,excellent product everything was good i got the product at the time that was expected good quality I am still using it,21,27

4690,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,these are not anything special and almost did not need them so flimsy and link / dust stick to them but they have kept them in better scratch free condition with them,28,31
4691,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i did not like this because it will not stay if you carry your itouch in your jeans pocket it might work for women if they carry the itouch in a purse,32,32
4692,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,stretch out to fast not worth anything because it dosnt protect the ipod at all it will not stay secure around the ipod so how can you call this a protective case,32,33

4699,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,very thin and too soft it does not offer a lot protection to the i pod it is just cute simple and does not offer a lot of grip,27,40
4700,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the armor cover was okay but screen protector wonuld not stick around the edges causing it to lift above the cover delivery was pretty quick although appx 1 week after ordered,30,41
4701,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,it was not so good i do not know it was like kinds bad it is already crackingon the corners it was not ok,22,42
4702,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the clear case is more on the white side my son wanted a clear case for his ipod to protect a decal that he put on the back but it is hard to see thru this case,37,43
4703,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i bought this product hoping that it would protect my itouch however i was shocked to notice that every time i took my ipod out of my pocket it would come out without the case this would happen every time this resulted in my ipod getting scratched much more if I had have a case that actually did it is job bottom line if your planing o buying this product think again because i 100 regret this purchase not only that electromaster said that silicone cases are meant to fit more loose compared to other types of cases now fit more loosely in this case simply means it does not even stay on your ipod now if yuor buying a case to be a case why get this it does not work at all,130,44
4704,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,the case is pretty nice and i will use it until i can afford a better one the screen protector is no good although unless you are an expert at getting it on with no air bubbles I am not and it did not have instructions for installation either,48,45
4705,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,the screen do not work for the ipod to many air bubbles and the cover is not as looked in the photos,21,46
4706,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the white one fits fine but it sometimes come off easily the black one is useable but it is so loose,20,47
4707,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,honestly i did not have high expectations of the material considering the price however the real problem for me was two things first both covers did not fit i tried them on 2 different ipod touch devices with no luck at all and the same defect the covers do fit vertically but do not fit horizontally they are too wide on both the right and left sides so you are left with a droopingon both sides secondly the dimensions of the screen protector are not an exact fit nor does it align exactly on the ipod touch i would have been more than willing to have given this product a much higher rating and review if it was only a question of material but no,127,48
4708,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the cases are not the best quality kind of loose it is alright the screen protector that comes with it is crap overall it is alright you get what you pay for,30,49
4709,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for a case that is not to loose and does not collect dust then do not get this case instead get a tpu tpu is like hard rubber tight fit and does not attract dust on the other hand thisattracts dust and is a loose fit,51,50
4710,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i thought these ipod cases were a good deal but should have known the price was too good to be true they are cheap flimsy and barely stay on my ipod the screen protector does not adhear well either i managed to apply it without bubbles but the corners are already pulling up and it has developed bubbles somehow i have already ordered a more expensive more substantial case do not waste you money on these,75,51
4711,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,the ipod covers are great they fit and work properly the screen protector is great as well and the rag that comes with it comes in handy,27,52
4712,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i bought these because they were super cheap but they are too big for the ipod they fit on but fall off easily and stretch out and i do not like that especially when i need it protected while my 3-year-old plays with the ipod the cover lasted about 2 months before i had to replace it with something else the screen protector worked fine for a month or so but scratched easily i will not buy this product again,79,53
4713,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,the product was good also it came on time it is very cheapi will recommend this productbut the rubber cover does not fit my ipod properly,25,54
4714,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,i got these with out reading the reviews first first off the cases do not stay on very well at all also the protector i found was hard to put on i gave one to my dad for his ipod touch which he does not use much and it works only because he does not use it much i mainly have mine for a back up just in case something happens to the cover I am using now,75,55
4715,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,it was excellent i liked most of all time and not much dilated i liked the delivery and so kind in which i came to leave,26,56
4716,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the case is good but the screen protector is not a good quality stays full of air pockets not happy,20,57
4717,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,it fits great on my i pod touch both the screen protector and the case i would say it was a great buy for the price,26,58
4718,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,i like both of the cases and i used the black one first i realized that it was a little loose on my ipod and i had to readjust it a lot i switched to my clear one after a few months and it fit perfectly,46,59
4719,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,i got these in case the other covers broke which they did these things were loose from the start not very good,22,60

4721,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,covers feel good but are flimsy and do not stay on well due to the small border on the bottom it immediately started peeling up my screen protector sorry i really can not recommend this product,35,62
4722,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,i got these cases at a time when i could not afford a really expensive case that offered the best protection for my ipod touch these cases fit my ipod very snug and with a screen protector they did offer good protection for my ipod i recently dropped my ipod and i feared that the screen was ruined but after picking it up there was not a scratch on it i would recommend these cases for anyone looking for a cheap temporary case for their ipod touch,85,63
4723,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,great quality specially designed for the ipod great price it is simply that they are kind of the basics they are great u will not be upset buy them,28,64
4724,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,do not buy piece of garbage the screen protector does not adhere without a ton of bubbles and it comes off very easily the silicone case barely stays on and are not worth fighting to keep it on i repeat do not buy,42,65
4725,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,everything about these are great only negative it the fact they slip off of my ipod they even came early then the set date it was suppose to be here the screen protector went on easy and has been working ever since,42,66
4726,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i do not know about you but protective armour case tells me that these are hard plastic cases no no these are those horrible flimsy jello-like non-covers that do not do anything to protect your ipod i bought them for my parents because they both got new ipod touches for christmas and i feel like i completely wasted my time and money by ordering something that I had never want to put on my own ipod let alone on someone elses brand new one even worse there were no screen protectors in the package I had send the covers back and ask for a refund but there was no packing slip in the package or even a return address oh and these items do not ship from the us they are direct from hong kong guess that ought to teach me,134,67
4727,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,highly reccomend this product for those that want some protection at a good price personally i suggest you spend a little more and check out multiple layer protection covers,29,68
4728,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,garbage garbage and then if course garbage it is so flimsy that it stretches out of shape within a day guess you get what u pay for stay away from this one,32,69
4729,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,very happy with this product it came very fast and was exactly as described it was so much cheaper than buying in store and came with a nice screen protector two durable silicon cases and a little cleaning cloth perfect,40,70
4730,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,these were basic cases they are better than i thought you get something good for a cheap price they were sent fast and are in good condition,26,71
4731,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,great value for the price thecame before estimated arrival time the cases are a bit loose on the bottom but functional none the less ],27,72
4732,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,product arrived without instructions while i am familiar with this product the recipient was not very difficult to properly apply not at all impressed,24,73
4733,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,this is a great deal you get cases and a screen protector for a tiny price the package came on time and shipping cost is low i recommend it,29,74
4734,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,i got what i ordered and it doing what it is supposed to do and even if it was not perfect which so far is i would not complain because of the price,31,75
4735,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,to loose to fit the ipod kept falling off very annoying i do not think it would of protected it well a 14 year old,25,76
4736,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the silicone case covers are a little lose but i guess that is how silicones are meant to be flexible the screen protector is not so great although coz i just can not get rid of the bubbles i had to buy a different one the price is still cheap for this bundle you are basically paying for 2 silicone covers,59,77
4737,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,i have to admit i bought these because they were inexpensive at first i only put on the screen protector so my son could choose which of the two cases to use it seemed fine with the usual challenge of not having dust get on the film while trying to install still ended up with about 4 pieces each then causing an impossible to remove air-pocket in the screen but not bad better than his screen looked before i cleaned it to install the shield but then he put on his case of choice turns out the case has a lip that comes around the front that is just big enough to continually grab theof the screen protector and lift it up for several days i kept grabbing the ipod and tucking that screen protector back under the case lip but eventually there was so much dust and pet hair stuck on the screen protector that it is mostly detached another few days and he will probably take it off since it such a hinderance bottom line probably better to pay a bit more for ones that work better the 10 screen protector i bought for my ipod 2 years ago is still well attached maybe if this one were trimmed down so the case did not flick it up it would last better,226,78
4738,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,these seem to be decent cases although they are just a little loose not loose to the point of falling off but if your thumb slips down from the home button the bottomof the case will roll over thebeing silicone it will pop right back into position once your thumb moves off it although,58,79
4739,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,excellent value i got a screen protector plus two cases all for around four dollars the cases are good however they are a little on the looser side note that as long as you do not store your ipod touch mostly in your jean pockets you should be fine with this product when i try and take it out of or put it into my jeans pocket the case sometime slips off and can get bit annoying at times but for leisure use in the office or on the study table it works wonderfully,95,80
4740,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,for the money you can not beat it it works well and i recieved it within a few days of placing the order,23,81
4741,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,they fit my i-pod but they are very slippery material i-pod slips right out of case when in your pocket not worth the money would not recommend,26,82
4742,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,the price of the cases was great the screen cover was just the standard screen cover that applies easy if you get the order right for the cases themselves they are not the absolute best because they fit a little loose but it stays on when i need it to and does not give me too much problems good price for this product,62,83
4743,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,it is not what i expected but i guess it is okay for the price i do not believe the regular price of 2000 the case is not as sturdy but the protective screen is good,34,84
4744,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,cheap in every way i wrote a long review last week but amazon was down so it did not go out i want to write something because i depend on the reviews when purchasing items online i just got my new cover and protector to replace the cheap ones i got and am so happy mivizu product the cheap ones i ordered from whatever company in hong kong was unusable i thought i could deal with cheap product but the way they made it made it unusable spend 4 bucks more get a great product and get it 2 weeks faster,100,85
4745,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,thiswas cheap and came in quickly the actual product feels nice in the hands it keeps the ipod feeling as slim as possible it does have a problem with pulling up the corners of my screen protector although i quickly fixed this with placeing a zagg full body on then using this product i like that it comes with 2 cases basicly great for the price,68,86
4746,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,the screen protector on this thing is utter crap the paper from the little tabs that came on it telling you how to put it on left a good amount of themselves on the actual product when i tried to take them off now it is starting to peel off after only a few weeks the cases are alright a bit loose but nothing too bad get what ya pay for spend a few bucks more for something better,78,87
4747,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i was overwhelmed by the smell of thisas soon as i opened it smells exactly like charcoal lighter fluid i would be concerned about this thing getting close to a heat source no way am i going to carry this around and subject my skin to whatever unknown chemicals are in this thing,55,88
4748,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,this ipod cover is a waste of money the cover was constantly slipping off my ipod i would not suggest buying this case,23,89
4749,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,these really are not the best covers for my ipod it barely wraps around the front to cover the edges and it does slip off very easily i have the clear screen protector film on mine and these will push the film up and because it to bubble it is annoying if you simply want something cheap to cover the back of your ipod to prevent scratching and more this will work fine that is it is intended purpose but these are pretty poor pass,81,90
4750,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,in my personal opinion of this product I had give it a 3 or 4 out of 10 the screen protector was the only thing that prevented me from giving this thing a failing rating and even that was not so great i was thinking that one of the cases was going to be a hard cover not soft and that there were going to be more than just 1 screen protector all in all this is a lousy buy,76,91
4751,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,i hated the fact that i bought these i thought they would be a great buy but i was wrong they cases keep slipping off and the screen protectors are cheap,31,92
4752,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,if you want something to protect it against scratches buy this if you smash your things a lot keep looking,20,93
4753,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,nice bundle the retailers would charge you 4 times the amount for a kit that includes 2 covers and screen protection great way to keep your itouch looking new thank you amazon and vendors for selection batman,37,94
4754,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,the silicone cases fits the ipod touch perfectly the screen protectors gives you an excellent cover and do not loose screen sensibility even playing games is sensitive enough do not loose this oportunity and buy it the seller ships fast and secure,40,95
4755,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,for starters great price to follow shipped and arrived sper fast way before the estimated delivery date would be they fit great on my ipod touch 4th generation and also look good if your planing on buying for the same ipod go for it,45,96
4756,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,the screen protector actually felt really nice i do not use the cases but i will if i need to it was a great 3,24,97
4757,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,it worked perfectly for me i had no problem you will have to have pacience to put the screen protector without bubbles very good and cheap,26,98
4758,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,i bought these about 23 months ago and still working great the screen covers are still on very well even after a lot of use,24,99
4759,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,why bother spending 15 to get an ipod jacket at best buy when you can get this inexpensive and durable one at amazon,23,100
4760,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,I have only had my ipod touch for about 2 months now and got the black silicone protector for it figuring it would be all I had need i usually have my ipod in my back pocket so it is safe most of the time and is not in much danger of falling or anything this case did a pretty good job at first it is comfortable fits around the ipod perfectly and you can access the volume and power buttons easily the hole on the back for the cameras also the right size that is all that really matters right cut to a few weeks ago when i noticed a couple of small tears in the casing i never pulled at the case when taking it off at least not in the areas the rips showed up in and the sides of the case are suddenly loose and the ipod pops out of it every other time i take it out of my pocket this things also a magnet for dust and gets dirty easily for the price it does a good job for short-term protection but I had only get this if you need a quick replacement case and somehow can not get a better one right then and there the screen protector also is not as good as some of the others and can be a pain to get on without any air bubbles but when you finally get it on it does a very good job of keeping scratches from ruining the screen it just starts to peel at the corners a little bit over time but with a proper case over it this is not a big deal,272,101
4761,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,the covers are pretty nice i like thechoices but it seems like the black one fits better than the white one the screen cover is super hard to put on properly i had to restick it several times and now it is like dirty on one side kinda annoying but i mean overall the whole combo is a great purchase comes with everything,64,102
4762,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,the silicone protective armour cases are okay not good for everyday protection considering how it can roll down off the sides easily so no it would not be good for you to keep it in your pocket all day if your on the go a lot the screen protector is clear but hard to put on and easy to get it wrinkled if not careful when pulling away from the first layer,71,103
4763,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,i thought this was a great deal when i bought it i did not know what i was looking for because i just bought my first ipod touch when i put the skin and the cover screen on the ipod touch i was not impressed the cover screen is awful air bubbles show up no matter how careful you are about putting it on in addition the protective skin is flimsy if i dropped my ipod i doubt it would do very much to protect it look for something else trust me,91,104
4764,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,as other reviews say of this product the covers do not stay on well in a pocket also even although my ipod was absolutely clean the screen protector still refused to go on perfectly but for the price free shipping was important since i bought with the ipod it is serviable,49,105
4765,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,5.0,positive,the silcone covers i ordered are excellent for my 4 g i pod touch they work great and stay on they were delivered in a timely manner i would order from this company again,33,106
4766,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,this a great product and is worth your money the screen protector sticks perfectly with the wholes of by like a millimeter the cases slide off a tiny bit at the bottom when you pull it out of your pocket overall your product will look really great in this case and the screen protector works like a charm this is a really good product at a great affordable price i encourage you to buy this product,76,107
4767,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,silicone covers are fine the screen protectors are junk because they are sticky and do not allow smooth touch / swipe,19,108
4768,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,i like these cases and the price is right they are very attractive and fit my ipod touch 4 g but they are not as snug as i would like still a great value although and I am glad i purchased,39,109
4769,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,thin without texture will slip out of your hand too easy flash from molds shows lack of quality cheap in price and quality,23,110
4770,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,i wanted it for the grip and it sure did the trick the silicone material is great for grip and protection but it is soft enough that it folds off the ipod every time i put it in my pocket it is great if you just carry yours around or leave it plugged into a player but not great otherwise,58,111
4771,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,they fit my ipod and are ok the rubber feels cheap tho and there was left over rubber around the case i had to cut off seems like it was badly molded,32,112
4772,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,okay product only complaints would be that they sometimes slip off and the screen protector sticker leaves a residue on the screen cover,23,113
4773,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,the silicone cases work well protecting the ipod however the screen savers will not stay adhered to the face of the ipod yes they were installed properly they both would not stick and ended up in the trash,37,114
4774,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043D06M2,2.0,negative,if you ever drop your phone you may want to rethink this case it breaks pretty easily and some of the zebra print was missing on the sides when i got it,31,0
4775,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043D06M2,1.0,negative,thisseemed to be made very cheap it would not stay on my phone and i ended up having to trash it after attempting to use it for an hour the two pieces would not stay connected together would not buy another one like it it was a waste of my money,50,1

4807,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,well before i bought this cell phone i did plenty of research from reading to watching videos i have to say that i really love this phone it does what i want in that i now have web on my cell plan and i can get into everything on the net so far with this unit you can listen to music and play games you can even watch videos i like the size it fits into my pocket very nicely it is a great little phone the only thing i will complain about is the sound quality i think it is a a little tinny i think it could be louder when on speaker phone but i can live with it if anything else i would like to see the battery last longer so to give you a example if i surf the web and use 1 mg a day and leave the unit on all day with texting about 10 times and making 5 calls a day the battery will last 1 day i have to charge it up that night for the next day if i shut it off for 6 hours a day i can get 2 - 3 days out of it i suppose the screen takes a lot of power but all in all i love the phone it does it all,223,3

4809,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,the phone itself is good but it did not come with a data cable and a headset it seems the oem shop gave me a used battery it lasts only a half day with a minimum use of only making and receiving a few phone calls i had to order all three accessories and it costs about additional 10,58,5
4810,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,5.0,positive,when this phone arrived i was a bit unsure about it because of the generic box also the packaging was somewhat mediocre but overall this is a great phone the delivery was faster then i expected it may have taken 2 - 3 days time the device is touchscreen and it supports a micro-sd card it can play music store photos videos and more if your with t-mobile all you have to do is a quick sim card switch and your set if not you will may have to pay an boot up fee of some sort since your not currently on a t-mobile contract if your just trying to upgrade to a newer phone i highly suggest this one i am pleased with my product,122,6

4835,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,2.0,negative,i have had this phone for about 6 months now i was satisfied with all the features at first however if you browse internet the battery dies in about 5 minutes it came to the point when while talking on a fully charged phone for about 10 min i get a low battery warning if i hang up right at that moment the battery indicator bars can go back up to 3 out of 5 if i continue talking for a few minutes longer it turns off i have to charge it both overnight and at work every single day and i barely use it during a day i expected the phone to last a bit longer but i guess it will not,122,31
4836,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,i have had my behold for almost 2 years now i bought two of them think i paid 89 at the time it is a great phone and since i work overseas a lot being unlocked was a necessity it came and right out of the box it was up and running i like the camera and get great photos however if there is anything i do not like about the phone it is the handling of photo files it has been difficult for me to transfer from behold to my computer it works some times and other times no even had computer geeks at work try to download with no success i even downloaded samsung pc studio or whatever it is and that did not help but overall i love the phone i would buy another like i said great value,142,32

4840,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,1.0,negative,it looked all fine and dandy online the week of anticipation build up during shipping made expectations high as well even upon arrival the slick little body seemed nearly perfect considering it was just a samsung and not a smartphone but disappointment rushed in when i began playing with the features 1 the touch screen fail it was lacking to say the least the screen is very insensitive and requires multiple taps on the same key to even text 2 for the life of me i could not figure out how to turn off the vibration touch recognition without turning off sounds to the entire phone when the ringer volume is on the screen makes a very annoying beep each time it is touched when it is on vibration mode it vibrates the only way i could find to get it off is to turn off all phone sounds maybe there is some secret way but by this time i was not particularly interested in trying to find out 3 my sim card did not even work in it it said it was compatible with t-mobile but apparently that means every t-mobile customer sans me the sim card slot is very weird i felt like i was sliding my card into a forbidden crevice and had some struggle even getting it back out again i put the device back in it is little bubble wrap bag and boxed it up leaving it forstore to deal with kudos to the seller for processing a quick and easy refund although,256,36
4841,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,ordered to replace old phone received it within estimated window had no problems since putting it into service 2 - 3 weeks ago,21,37
4842,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,the reason i gave this3 stars is because when i received theit came in a different samsung box with a white sticker on the side of the box that says samsung behold it also was package great love that but it did not come with any directions i had to google the product in order to figure things out about this phone but the shipping was great it came very fast over all i love the phone it is great for a replacement phone,87,38
4843,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,bought this phone used it came fully packaged like it was straight from the manufacturer with battery phone charger usb connection and more the phones appearance was flawless phone itself sometimes freezes and can be a little glitchy at times but overall it serves it is purpose and works fine most of the time it helps to power off the phone at the end of the day my biggest complaint is that when i connected the phone to the computer the samsung software had a problem with the phone being unregistered i do not know if that is a general error or a user error but otherwise the phone still charges while connected to the computer the battery life is decent also the camera works great and comes with a flash i would not recommend this phone to someone with large hands or fingers overall phone is a good value if you are looking for a touch-screen non-smart phone without having to renew your contract with your provider,165,39
4844,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,i love samsung phones but i made a mistake buying this one it is really basic and has no wi-fi good phone for older and younger people,27,40
4845,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,1.0,negative,frankly i was really loking forward to this purchase since this is my first time buying a mobile phone online unfortunately this buying experience turns out to be disaster in the following paragraphs i will expalin why you need to think more carefully before making your decision to buy this cell phone first of all although the website lists the product condition as new in reality it is not it is evident when i opened the mailing bag the package is dented and has ssigns of being forcefully opened before and small plastic bags containing important parts such as ear phone charger all have big scratches if these hints do not suggest the product is used i do not what will do also the biggest concern of all i can ignore all the minor problems such as slow shipping is when i followed all the appropriate steps on the manual to set up the phone and charge it for 4 - 5 hours exactly as the manual says the phone just will not turn on i even charged it for 10 hours the screen still will not activaate until then i realize the phone itself has serious defeacts that can not be ignored before your purchase please think carefully first about this phones risks,207,41
4846,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,2.0,negative,purchased this in june and worked ok for a while but in trying to text the screen would not automatically turn and show the keyboard got worse as time passed contacted seller who referred me to manufacturer manufacturer said it was out of warranty now has a thumping sound and feeling when on the phone and drops calls a lot seller states that it is beyod the 7 day warranty period very dissatisfied with phone and seller,77,42
4847,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,this is a good phone for texting and calling that is about it not a good phone for internet and or using apps it is just too slow for that type of graphics do not settle for this phone if your budget allows you to get something better,45,43

4849,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,this phone was for my wife who hated her samsung gravity-tshe had a very hard time navigating with the gravity-t and the slide out keyboard was too small for her the behold has the vertual keyboard which is large enough for her to see without her glasses and also the touch screen is friendlier to her than the one on the gravity-t although they are both probably the same technology the behold seems to be more user friendly even although it is an older phone model with 3 g capability if she wants to upgrade to a web package she can anyway she is much more satisfied with the behold,109,45

4851,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,5.0,positive,i must say that i hate the smartphones i see no real use for them in my profession of the law i see a lot of time being wasted by the smartphone users so i wanted a phone just a phone with ability to receive and answer texts from my kids the samsung behold is a great phone not the latest but easy to use and very good phone quality my wife loves smartphones and wastes lots of time on the web playing games and more and she has a samsung galaxy s i had a samsung that took a bath in our washer so i needed a new phone the behold was inexpensive works great and i am happy i bought it amazon was great to deal with shipping was fast and product was new in boxes,137,47
4852,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,used this phone with an israeli sim card from orange and it worked absolutely perfectly others have commented on the specific features so i need not repeat the phone quality was excellent i did not use the browser very much text messages and voice mail and actual calls were problem free the charger cord was specific to the phone and when we lost one it was difficult to find a replacement other than that the phone worked perfectly we plan to use these with appropriate sim cards in future trips to other countries,92,48

4888,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,i was looking into a phone for my mom because she recently lost her phone and wanted something a little more modern this phone is the answer she has very happy with the phone and uses it just about everyday for the simple things and it looks very nice pros internet was surprisingly fast on the phone and the video quality was rather amazing gps the turn by turn direction is a little slow but still performs adequately very clear phone calls without any static or interference the phone looks very clean and nice cons despite how it looks in the pic it was surprisingly small which makes whatever is on the screen rather hard to press if you have big fingers the touchscreen is really hard to press sometimes it does not register if you just gently touch it like the newer models the call end call and back button at the bottom of the phone is really hard to press because the buttons are so small this phone is very small and compact and will perform exceedingly well for simple tasks i would suggest a bigger phone if you are a guy because no matter how hard you try everythings so small and hard to press recommended for a woman or child,219,84

4897,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,I have had this phone since it first arrived in late 2008 on tmobile i chose it over the g1 and glad i did it was my first touchscreen phone i bought a case protector on day one have dropped it several times on concrete and hard surfaces but the phone keeps working I am not much of an internet user via phone but I have used it for that on occasion and it works fine the touchscreen has some scratches but after two and a half years that is expected all of the functions software camera still are in great working condition samsung makes durable products that are meant to last i know that does not amount to much in todays world because of ever changing smart phones trends and more but when you are paying 300 a pop for a new phone you like to think it will last over a year this phone has outlasted any other phone I have ever had i had to finally purchase a new battery after two years it had worked fine up until then but towards the end i had to charge it once a day with a new battery it is like new again camera flash is bright software is good call quality is great touchscreen is pressure 5mp camera although this quality only really comes through in daylight conditions but flash is good,224,93
4898,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,2.0,negative,this seems to be a nice phone but the phone that i ordered was suppose to be new clearly this is a used phone with another persons phone numbers already in it also there was no manual and i do not know how old the battery is but it does not look new either i should have paid a little more and got my phone from amazon instead of this seller,70,94

4900,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,i had it for two years now it is not the best phone out there there is no wifi it is a pretty simple phone the battery life is not bad last about 3 days camera is okay but the flash is crazy it flashes 2 or 3 times and it blinds my eyes you can click on the touch screen with a pencil if u would like it does not require heat to control the buttons the gps does not work i think it requires internet but overall it is a pretty simple phone i like more high tech phones this phone used to be high tech 2 years ago,107,96
4901,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,no software for windows 7 to perform pc sync only xp / vista it is a pain same as above you need to use samsungs own software for sync versus usb direct access non common connector type the phone does not use mini-usb same as above for audio jack the same port is used for usb audio and charger that means you have to purchase a special ear piece if you are not using blue tooth camera shot takes a bit too long and performs bad under dim light condition day light is good otherwise a good entry level phone to have light and feel high quality in construction,113,97
4902,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,i thought it was too good to be true when i purchased this case it is really cute theis spot on like the picture but the problem is that the case does not close i tried starting with different corners but no matter what the last one left will never shut plus I have had the case for less than a week and i am really good with my phone i do not drop it put it on rough surfacesand yet the bottom corners are peeling already I am kind of disappointed but i guess for not paying too much this is what i should have expected,107,0

4904,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,i loved this cover when i purchased it and i love the deal i got on it however there is a corner that will not snap shut no matter what and the design is chipping off of the plastic it is upsetting,41,2
4905,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,i ordered this case along with a few others this was one of the first to arrive so of cource i put it on well i can not get the darn thing off i guess that could be good in way being that your phone is secure inside the case i do like change and like to change my cases out i like different colors and styles but i think my phone is stuck i tried prying it off but I am afraid of damaging my phone the case all around is ok looking it looks a little cheap where it meets together to snap closed it is missing some paint and looks a little scratched the paint is also peeling a way a bit at one of the cut outs in the back there are also a few other little nicks and scrtaches on other areas of the case it has a few minor cosmetic issues but for the price i can not really complain only wish i could get it off delivery was quick and price was great so I had say if your a one case kind of person this would be great for you phone feels secure and looks pretty good too,201,3
4906,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,i absolutely love this case it fits perfectly i love the rubberized feel which is soft to the touch but still hard enough to protect my phone if i drop it and it looks great I am stoked,38,4
4907,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,the printed pattern on the back is completely chipping off parts stick to my wifes hands definitely do not buy this product it was a cheap price and not worth the effort to return it,35,5
4908,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,case was not a sturdy case to keep phonefrom breaking but if you just want looks then great case for looks nothing more,22,6

4910,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,the case was very pretty and i received it very fast the only problem was that i dropped my phone once after puuting it on and the corner clip broke on it needless to say i was only able to use the case about 2 more weeks and it was broken so bad it would not stay on anymore i would def buy from the seller again tho,67,8
4911,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,i liked the phone case for the most part it was cute and girly but the leopard print actually started to peel off after about a week,27,9

4913,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,fast shipping and it looks very cute and fun and of course easy to find the paint is starting to disappear a little bit but it is bound to happen right anyways it does not bother me i am loving this case,41,11
4914,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,this product is inexpensive so i did not mind as much the bad quality but overall it is pretty bad it is a matte finish not a glossy one like the picture and the print starts to peel off after the first couple uses i got it for the sake of having something different to look at but I have ended up going back to my old cases,65,12
4915,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,the case looked wonderful at first but that did not last long the print peels off without hardly any distress to the phone or case after having this awesome print cover for a week you will be left with just a silver cover that looks like crap definitely does not last long probably would not purchase this again as it is not worth the time and money,63,13
4916,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,i love this phone case it came fast and worked great i dropped my phone a couple times and it still works,22,14
4917,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,the design lasts maybe a week before it starts to scratch off it is really not worth the money for a cheap case,22,15
4918,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,love this case super affordable great fit the only complaint i have is that the coating chips a bit nothing major although not bad for what i paid for it,30,16

4920,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,i love this phone case it is adorable easy to wipe clean and so far it seems to be very durable,21,18
4921,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,this is pretty and has a soft velvety feel but the plastic is thick making it hard to reach buttons and i had to enlarge the opening for the charging port the plastic edges are white and really show up,40,19
4922,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,love theand design is durable but alignment of the charging port does not allow for cord to plug in tight cord falls out too easy,26,20
4923,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,this product would not close completely over my phone no matter how i tried one corner would always not snap shut it was still secure but thewould catch on things functional ish would not recommend this product,38,21
4924,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,i received compliments on the colors of this product at first had difficulty keeping it on phone but some muscle kept it in place started chipping after two weeks,29,22
4925,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,this case feels great but does not last long i have had mine for about a month and thehas worn off the case where my hands most frequently touch my phone very disappointed not worth the hassle of buying it even if it is cheap,46,23
4926,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,love thisrecieved it in the mail faster than i expected love that it is hard enough to keep my phone sturdy if i drop it love the feel of the rubberdized could nt ve been any happier thanks jessica,39,24

4928,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,my wife thinks it is sexy it fits in there like a glove tight there is enough of a lip on the front to help protect the screen,29,26
4929,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,it came when it was supposed to and works very nicely nice design and rubberization is good too only complaint was that the sides had paint missing when we received it like it either was not painted very well or it was painted before it was broken from the mold my wife did not want to wait for shipping again so we just kept it all in all a pretty good product even with the paint chipping because the same type of case would of costed more at the mall even with shipping,92,27
4930,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,liked the cover but it did not fit phone properly the little clips broke when i snapped it together was cheap although so i guess you get what you pay for,31,28
4931,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,i loved the case when i saw it on amazon and when it arrived at my house but one side did not fit and no matter what i tried it would not snap,32,29
4932,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,the case fits securely and is pretty decent the only complaint i have is i have had it on my phone now for about 3 - 4 weeks and theis already scraping off on the back plate right in the middle for the price I am not to disappointed however i would probably be a little learly on ordering another one oh and it is not rubberized like one may think it is still a plactic cover,74,30
4933,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,product arrived quickly saved me money perfect fit for my phone will probably order more covers in time from amazon great service,22,31
4934,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,i did not buy this thinking it would last me a long time but i did not expect it to only last me a month i had just bought the thunderbolt a few days before purchasing this so i was looking for something cute to protect my phone let us just say this cover is already in the trash within a month of buying it the paint started to wear off the case if it was only a few minor dings i would not have minded but these were large chips not to mention the cover is very difficult to remove one of the plastic grooves actually broke off when i was trying to remove the cover and now it will not completely shut I am very disappointed because i really liked the look and feel of the case but ultimately it just was not a good product i spent a little more money and got a better product elsewhere,153,32
4935,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,the case does what it says it does has a nice smooth soft feel did not click all the way around so the top does come loose and it is starting to peel after 15 months,34,33
4936,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,guess it my fault all i saw htc evo not thunder boltdid not feel like returning did not cost that muchnot worth the return but pretty upset about,25,34
5010,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,the case looks great it came faster than predicted which was awesome it looks really cool but take note of the square edges it threw me off that is the only down side to the case for the price i would expect the quality i got which was not perfect i love the look but do not use it too often because it if kind of bulky otherwise it is a fun cool and different case i like to use when i switch my phone cases,82,0
5011,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,love the old school feel of this for my ipod like every single person has already said it does not have an opening on it for you to charge it with the case on so if that is what you really really want you are not going to find it on this i personally like that it is covered because it bounces around on the bottom of my purse and there has no telling what kind of nasty will get in there so I am glad it is protected,84,1
5012,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,it is a cool case but it got kinda smashed in the mail so it does not fit perfectly on one side other than that it came fast and everyone seems to love it,32,2
5013,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,it looks so cool it is a bit loose in the back but other than that I have already gotten so many compliments on it,23,3
5014,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,pros in looks it is very cute stylish and a bit odd people have mistaken it fromo the back as a tape the rubber is more protective than i thought it would be cons it does not have an opening at the bottom for you to plug your phone recharger into,50,4
5015,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,awesome for the price came from hong kong so took awhile to get here but i really love it the silicone keeps it from falling off of everything,28,5
5016,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the hole for the camera lens is not big enough there was always a little purple in the pic,19,6
5017,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,adorable lots of compliments when i use it,8,7
5018,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,i have to take my case off every time i want to charge my phone,14,8
5019,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,over time it gets stretched out so it does not fit quite as snugly as it did when you first get it but it has really nice grip to surfaces so it is hard to drop if you are a person that has butterfingers,42,9
5020,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,cute but loose on my iphone 5 my phone falls off and it happens to fall right in the corner where the case accidentally slipped off it is not a very secure protection for my phone this was the main reason why i bought it i also got it because it was cute but if i had known i could scratch my phone with it i would have gotten something else the colors are still as good as new the print is also great but it is not a secure case for my phone,91,10
5021,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,low quality and will not protect the case but looks so cute,11,11
5022,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,too weak your phone will slip right out of it,10,12
5023,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,absolute junk cheap flimsy thin rubber covering get what you pay for,11,13
5024,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,obviously it is rubber but my iphone 4 shattered with this case on it looks cute but not durable at all,21,14
5025,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,cute phone case i love theand it fits wells the material seems to be of good quality for the price,22,15
5026,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,it looks exactly as the picture i would only suggest that these cases come with something to allow a cord of some sort to hold it to your wrist at least very cool look,34,16
5027,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for a cheap flimsy piece of rubber that did not last a week before it was trashed shipped direct from china,25,17
5028,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,i had to take my phone out of the case every time i needed to plug it in it became a stupid hassle i did not want to deal with so i eventually stopped using the case all together,38,18
5029,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,not so good product it is very nice now the case but soon stretched and not working properly 60 percent recommended,20,19
5030,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,love these cases purchased one in about 4 different colors cases are true toas pictured i get so many compliments on them love the rubber because i does not scratch my phone like hard plastic dropped my phone a few times and they did a beautiful job of protecting my phone only downside is after awhile the rubber becomes worn and starts to loose it is form and fit would like to see them made in a gel rubber whic seems to hold it is shape better,87,20
5031,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,i love my phone case it is my favoriteand at times had me tricked on whether or not if it was an actual cassette tape when my screen part was faced down,34,21
5032,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,the case was for some reason designed to cover the port for charging your phone so when i need to charge my phone i have to take the case off it was a greatand it looks really cool,40,22
5033,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,thiswas dry rotten so it broke apart,9,23
5034,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,very cute and trendy affordable but also kind of big on iphones because mine is always slipping or sliding off the phone,22,24
5035,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,it is okay cool looking pros cool looking cons if phone is in your pocket make sure there is nothing in that pocket because the minute you pull your phone out everything is going with it including your pocket laughing out loud other than that it is okay i do prefer hard case over silicone but it is whatever,54,25
5036,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,this was ok for the money i guess it is fine it was just a cheap phone cover and fine while it lasted,22,26
5037,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,bought this case for my daughter and she absolutely loves it very cute and old school case buy buy buy,20,27
5038,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,when i have this case on people always think it is a real cassette tape instead of my phone case makes me chuckle laughing out loud but it is a simple yet cool case,30,28
5039,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i love it I have had it for some time now and i get so many compliments on it the only thing i wish were different is a cut out for the charger so i do not have to remove it every time,41,29
5040,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,no opening to charge phone while case is on case is ok looks like a real cassette like the,20,30
5041,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i like the case because of the design do not purchase if you are looking for a protective case good buy,21,31
5042,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i really loved the way this cover looked it did not offer much for protection so if you are a little rough with your phone i would not recommended it but for me it was perfect the only complaint i have is there is no hole in the bottom for the charger or a hole for the earbuds i do not use earbuds with my phone so that was not a big deal and since the rubber is flexible pulling it back to plug in the charger was no big deal if you are like me and talk on your phone while it is charged i recommend cutting a small space with an x-actor knife to make space for the charger but you can not beat it for the price hopefully they will continue making these for future iphone models because I had definitely repurchase,135,32
5043,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i do love the look of thison my phone but it does not really make sense that in order to charge the phone you have to take the phone out of the case because the slots on the bottom are not open for the charger,46,33
5044,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the case is okay there is not slot in the case for you to put the charger have to take case off to charge,24,34
5045,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,i got this for a friends daughter and she loves it very much and appreciates me for getting this for her her mother on the other hand can not stand me anymore,31,35
5046,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,this phone cover would not stay on my phone it is one main purpose aside from going old school and looking like a cassette tape and it could not even fulfill it is intent,30,36
5047,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,it was really cute and definitely fooled some people thinking it was a real cassette but it did not my iphone very good and there is not an opening for the charger,30,37
5048,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,it is a cute case but comes off easily it is not for protecting your phone at all but i do love it,21,38

5050,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,well it fits my iphone 4 but the only problem it does not have an outing for the chord for charge so that is my only problem it is cute,27,40
5051,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,well it is kinda too loose for iphone 4s was afraid it might drop off still have it new never used this can i sell it back,25,41
5052,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,i was happy to receive this cute novelty phone cover i was disapointed there was no opening in the bottom for the charging cord when my phone did wear the cover my screen protector was messed up because of having to slip the cover off to insert charger cord,49,42
5053,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,it is a fun cute case and it was a great deal for the price i can easily change it if i want to cover my iphone with something different,29,43
5054,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,this arrived faster than i expected the case is nice and good for protecting the phone too however after using it for one month the case started to loose so if you want something you can use for a long time do not buy this one,45,44
5055,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,this is a great product low cost and festive i strongly endorse this product if you would like your phone to be more playful and fiesty,26,45

5057,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i like my phone case everyone believe that i have a cassette tape but i tell them I am old school and this is nothing new to me,27,47
5058,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,so like it says it is a purple / blue silicone cassette tape case yeah cool thanks it is very cheap very floppy / flimsy and it does not even my iphone4 like it should it is larger than the phone itself and really square along the edges it would probably fit better if the corners were filled to fit the rounded corners of the ip4/4s but it is not the label on the back of the phone is like some weird painted on thing it looks really cheap and i will not be using this,86,48
5059,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,well the case looks cool and everyone compliments on it however this one did not have a slot cut out on it for the cord to attach to charge other then that love it,34,49
5060,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,no good quality sticker is paper bad quality the iphone doest fit perfectly inside i will probably not recommend this to anyone,22,50
5061,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,there was no space for the charger for my iphone 4s I am not sure what type of iphone it was for since it came from overseas i could not return it it is a cuteat least,38,51

5064,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the case is super cute and umlike other people my case does have holes for charger and headphones and volume buttons the only problem with my case is that it falls off all the time the material is like stretched out and although it will stay on if your careful theeres no point in a phone case if it does not seve some type of protective purpose,66,54
5065,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,i thought this case was going to be great for my phone however it is very cheap and the pictures do not do it justice i was very disappointed in this case,29,55
5066,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,it a pretty cool looking case and it is fun to see people think that it is a real cassette tape however there is not cut-out for the charger other than that it is pretty okay,32,56
5067,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,i get a lot of compliments on how cool it looks but it does not seem strong / thick enough like it would protect it very well from a fall,27,57
5068,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,i have not used this one yet but it was around 1 it is really thin and flimsy what can you say you get what you pay for,26,58

5073,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,it is a very fun case but only lost a star because it is not very protective it is pretty thin so if you are looking for a very protective case this would not be it otherwise i think it is great,37,63
5074,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,the case actually looks like a cassette tape and the purpleis very nice fits the iphone 4s very well,20,64
5075,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the case was very loose around the phone other than that it was pretty cute not meant to be protective,20,65
5076,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,excelentes condiciones original y en buen estado recomendado ademas de responsable y cuidadoso en el envo nada de terrazos,20,66
5077,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,great for the price theis fantastic and unlike some of these that you can buy this one does have a charging port,24,67

5079,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,not only is the case cute and i get a lot of compliments but it also protects my fragile phone,20,69
5080,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for first i had to wait forever for this thing to my dismay plastic covers the onoff buttons and the volume controls looks cute but worthless,31,70
5081,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,my daughter likes it because it is different the case covers more parts of the phone so it takes care of what she needs it for,26,71
5082,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,fits perfect for my phone super cute it looks just like the picture no defects makes me smile every time i look at it because it takes back to cassette days,31,72
5083,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,totally cool this sells for 20 at the kiosk in the mall i highly recommend this product to other shoppers,20,73
5084,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,there was not anything wrong with this case it was just a little too thin for me for the price it is worth it for cuteness but protection no,27,74
5085,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i love thedesign but i do not like how it covers my flash button when i take a picture and i do not like that it covers my apple symbol in the back,34,75
5086,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,this is a very cute unique case that offers ample protection for your precious iphone 4/4s i ordered the purple one but instead they sent a pink case with a blue and white sticker i like pink so i did not care but keep in mind that you may not get the correctwhen you order the case is slightly big but just by a smidge I have dropped my phone quite a few times and the rubberized casing absorbs the shock to protect your phone i am certainly satisfied,89,76
5087,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the case looks amazing not certain it really protects much it often falls off bumped placed in my purse and more likely would not buy it again,25,77
5088,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,thought the case would be more durable it is cute but quite flimsy does not help much for protecting the iphone delivery was great although takes a month but was here when estimated,31,78
5089,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,when receiving the purple cassette tape case i was expecting it to be a little rubberized but it is not at all very flimsy but cute and was cheap so ehh it is fine,32,79
5090,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,it is been almost one whole full month and i still have not received it no more overseas packages I am done urgh,20,80
5091,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,i did not keep this on my phone for very long it is very loose and if you put it in your purse it is going to come right off,27,81
5092,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,there is no hold for the charger and the case gets stretched out taking it off so much to charge the phone looks really cute on but did not last long due to becoming misshapped,33,82
5093,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,takes me back is a real cute accessory for the iphone i wish i could find them like this for my htc,22,83
5094,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,my daughter loves this because of how it looks not how it protects her phone it really does look like a cassette tape there is not slot for her charger and she has to take it off to charge her iphone so far it has not stretched out but i think it will,52,84
5095,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,these cases tend to stretch after a while considering it is silicon they fit a little funny because the cases a very rectangled especially at the corners over all it was an okay case i can not complain given the price,39,85
5096,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,it was just like it was described only thing that could make it better is it being a little thicker,20,86
5097,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,it was not purple more lavender was very disappointed thought it would be darker purple like the picture was not what i saw,23,87

5099,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,this product does not have a very snug fit so when you are pulling your phone out of your pocket it rips the case off highly annoying,26,89
5100,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,it is so cute i am horrible with my phone and drop it a lot this case has protected my phone pretty well,22,90
5101,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,no opening for charging and case is actuallly a bit too large for the iphone4 glad it was cheap because i can not really use it,25,91
5102,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,do not use this for protection it is sort of flimsy but it looks great it is only for show your iphone will really look like a cassette tape from the back as opposed to other phone case designs the iphone is the actual size of an old cassette tape so it is believable,52,92
5103,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,it is a fun looking case and the delivery was pretty fast another case to add to the collection and easy to put on and take off for changing depending on my mood and outfit,35,93
5104,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the phone case was up to my expectations you get what you pay for basically it looks the same in person as it does in the photo the only thing i would have to complain about would be on the bottom of the case there is no open spot for you to plug in your charger so that is very inconvenient however like i said before you get you get what you pay for lastly the case is not a hard one it is silicone,85,94
5105,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,arrived before expected delivery date the case is very cute but it does not stay on my phone lose fit there is no cut out for the charger not good for protection but very stylish,34,95
5106,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,the cover did not quite fit and came off all the time i used for about as long as it took to mail a different cover at least i only spent 1,31,96
5107,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,i never got it and i do not know how to contact someone so help please and i got my other case so i do not know what the problem is,30,97
5108,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,i love this case i was a little leery of purchasing it after i read some if the reviews but this case is absolutely perfect looking forward to purchasing more in the future,33,98
5109,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i like this product it initially fit sort of loose but overall it was as described and it is super cute it does however take a while to get to you so i would not recommend ordering from hong kong if you do not have patience but for the price i could not complain,50,99
5110,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,it is very cute and i loved it the only flaw is that there was no opening in the bottom to charge my phone so i had to take it off each time i needed to charge it the buttons on the side were not lined up either,46,100
5111,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,for only like 2 dollars this case is pretty decent it fits to my phone and it was thethat was shown the port holes are all there and they line up perfectly love it,36,101
5112,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i bought this for my sister she really likes it the only thing i do not like is it has no cut outs so you have to take the bottom off to charge,32,102
5113,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,not a big fan of rubber casesbut u get what u pay forcool case for a childilm going to give it to my niece when she gets an iphone4,29,103
5114,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,this thing is so cute it slips off really easily and i was unaware that the back had holes the two circles and the rectangular are holes and i can see the back of my phone which bothers me sooo much but other than that it is absolutely adorable and i love it it has not torn or anything and yeah hope that helps,63,104
5115,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,absolute crap not worth even the few bucks very bendy and hardly stays in place on the phone at all,20,105
5116,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i brought this iteam as a gift very cute and fun it was a very good gift for a college student,21,106
5117,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,the only good thing about this case is it is aesthetic value it has no practical value whatsoever because there is no opening for your charger and the holes for the lock button do not really line up it also makes the phone look really rectangular like the edges are not curved they are more sharp with this case so if that is not something you like then you should not get this case i mean for 1 you get what you paid for i only use it if I am going out at night but it is not an everyday protective kind of case,97,107
5118,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,first of all the seller sent a pink case instead of purple i will not bother contacting the seller to and go through all that crap to get another case that is just as crappy as this one this case is super flimsy rubber and there are holes in the case as decoration it does not cling to the phone and it will not protect it from dirt even the tape design on it is buffed out in some places so this case failed at all of the reasons for buying a phone case on the bright side it was cheap but it certainly was not a steal,103,108
5119,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,okay not a good quality case it does not fit my phone well it is kind of loose it did arrive fasten then expected but not the best case but good price although,31,109
5120,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,it is really cool i have nowhy it is listed as purple / blue because it is a very pretty purple i love it and just wish that it was maybe a bit sturdier,34,110
5121,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,i honestly was not expecting much since the price is so low it is flimsy it rips the paint rubs off the corners are thick which i like because they absorb some of the impact from falls overall it is good it is cute I shall recommend it for a temporary case just do not make it your all the time case,56,111
5122,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,let me first say i bought this case knowing i was paying a dollar for it so not having super high expectations now the purpleof the case is super pretty but the fit is a bit off and the case kind of sticks out in the back there is no charging hole so you do have to pull the case off to charge the phone so my phone ends up being out of the case as often as it is in it but all in all the case is pretty and serves it is purpose of being cool,99,112
5123,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,everything turned out the exact way it was expected to come and no damage i also received it on time great product,22,113
5124,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,i order this case along with others a little over a month ago and i am still waiting for it to arrive i know it is just 200 but that makes a difference this is not a donation i am upset was looking forward to receiving this case,47,114
5125,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,this product is really cheaply made roughly fits the 4s not very precise cuts for iphone controls for the price i guess it is ok i would not buy another one it does not protect the phone,36,115
5126,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,i ordered this case as well as a pink one the purple one was for my teenage sister in law when i received the case i was pleased with how it looked but the bottom did not have a slot to plug in the charger it was just solid the whole way across the top was the same with only a hole to plug in the headphones i was really annoyed by this but luckily my sister in law did not mind and just takes the case off to charge it the pink one i ordered however did have the slot to plug in the charger not sure why there was a difference i gave this cases three stars because when the case is on it really does look like a tape and my sister in law really enjoys using it if it had the slot for the charger it would of received 5 stars,154,116
5127,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,this is my favorite of all the cases that i have bought it is original and just awesome my only complaint is it is just a tad bit flimsy and loose it is needs to be a little more secur fitting to stay on the phone other wise i love it,48,117
5128,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,after reading all the product reviews for this i have to admit i was not sure if i wanted to make this purchase but i loved how it looked and for the price you honestly can not complain because it was only a few bucks when i recieved it i was not expecting much but to my surprise I am actually very satisfied with this product it fit my iphone perfectly the holes line up correctly and it has an opening on the bottom for the charger and speakers the only bad thing about this product is that it probably will not last very long but once again like mentioned before you get what you pay for so i did not expect to have the case for years or anything like that I am completly satisfied with the fact that it fits my phone like a glove everyone asks where i got it from because they love it and it was cheap it definitley will serve it is purpose for as long as it lasts,167,118
5129,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,i really like this cover for the iphone people complement me on it all the time the only issues that i have with it is that it is a bit loose for my iphone 4 i feel like my phone is just going to slip out of it sometimes another thing is that the cover does not have an opening on the bottom to charge my phone i have to take it out of the case in order to charge my phone which is a bit of a pain at times overall it is a super cute cover that for the money it is worth it and does the job,107,119
5130,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,i bought this case because it looked really cool it looks nice in person but the holes in the back make your phone prone to scratches but that problem can easily solved by putting a screen shield on the back of the phone the biggest problem i had with the case was the fact that it does not fit snug on the phone it was really loose and i could slide my phone around in it not very functional but it is a cool novelty,83,120
5131,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,awesome case and the case is made of a really good rubber looks really neat people will probably ask where you got it,23,121
5132,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i really enjoy this case even although it is not made to protect my phone at a high standard made of rubber theis bright which i love it fits pretty nicely but not a perfect fit it fits every part of the iphone 4s verizon and is a good back-up case got it at a very low price so i thought identification give it a shot identification recommend it to anyone looking for a fun case,77,122
5133,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,i was a little worried about ordering after reading some of the reviews but this cover could not have worked out better it fit perfectly on my iphone 4s verizon cdma the holes and buttons lined up perfectly and there was a cut out on the bottom for my charger so i would not have to take the cover when i charge like others have said it is probably not the case to get if you are expecting long term durability and protection but the cover i received looks just like the picture and seems to be pretty durable which is nice considering how inexpensive it is not to mention that it looks really cool on my iphone,114,123
5134,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,this is a great phone cover the silicon is helpful when you always carry your phone in your pocket because it will not slip out the cassette tape theme is a fun conversation starter as well product was shipped fast and came unopened great seller and great product thanks,49,124
5135,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,this phone cover is an awesome conversation piece it protects your phone and prevents it from slipping out of your hand the only down side is that you have to take off the cover to charge the phone there is no hole small inconeince for such a cool case,49,125
5136,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,this case is extrememly cheap first off there was no opening for my charger how are you supposed to charge / sync your iphone without an opening to the port take off the case each time i do not think so secondly the holes that were cut for buttons and speakers were not lined up at all there are holes in random places and i can not access any of the buttons thirdly the case looks much differently than it does in the photo the cassette is cheaply printed on and looks as if it would easily wear off i refuse to use thisand do not suggest it to anyone,107,126
5137,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,i love this case it is cute durable the material is soft to touch yet still tough and an easy grip I have recieved many compliments on it passerbys enjoy seeing my phone gussied up like it is would definatly recomend,39,127
5138,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,i have the white iphone and this fits great yes you have to take the skin off to charge but that is in the description so it is not a surprise the openings are all in the right place I am on verizon so i do not know if this makes a difference and the volume buttons work so that has not been a problem for me really my only complaint is that i would like to keep the skin on while charging but it is really not that big of a deal to me for 5 this is a great product,96,128
5139,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,i waited for two weeks to get it it came in a basically unmarked plastic bag with only the company name on it i took it out and it was laughably smaller than my iphone 4 it did not fit at all no matter how much we tried to stretch it on i ended up having to throw it away,59,129
5140,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i love these headphones i hated using a regular bluetooth because i feel like it is going to fall off and i can never get it on my ear i hated wearing regular headphones while running or at the gym because the cord would always get in the way now i do not have to worry about either i have a droid 2 and setting these up on my phone was a breeze the sound is pretty great considering and they stay on even through my toughest of workouts i love them in the car because i drive a jeep and i have horrible sound insulation in there i can hear the people on the other end perfectly with these i highly recommend they are a great product for a pretty good price ps heres an extra tip do not bother paying for the 3499 ones the only difference is you get is a cleaning cloth so not worth the extra 5,158,0
5141,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,got these today charged them up and they paired pretty easily with my iphone 4 one thing that i had a little problem was in the pairing the lights need to be flashing both blue and red they were just flashing blue and i could not pair i re-read the instructions and in my rush i missed the point that it needs to be flashing red and blue to be in pairing mode once it was done connected like a charm the controls worked fine also to skip songs i used them on the treadmill for a 40 min run and had no problems so happy to be able to run without the cord bouncing against me the sound quality is decent not pro quality but good overall very satisfied,129,1
5142,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i just opened the box hooked it up and i love it for the price you can not beat it the sound is great for such an inexpensiveno problems pairing the device it charges pretty quickly 25 hours only negative is the usb cord it is not a standard micro or mini plug which means that you have to carry this charger in addition to my phone charger device works great on htc evo 4 g,75,2
5143,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,the sounds is not the best but it is good enough for everyday use surprisingly the battery lasts a long time a lot longer than my last one motorola rokr sd9 the ear buds fits perfectly in my ear and it stays put when i walk or run after my kids overall it is a great product for the price,60,3
5144,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,they become uncomfortable after wearing for an extended period of time,11,4

5149,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i like these headphones but they can be a bit clumsy if you wear glasses they will not fit as well and seem to move around a bit the basic functionality is good the bluetooth is easy to pair and the rechargeable battery holds more charge than I have been able to use on a run,54,9
5150,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,worked well utill i was at the gym and sweat got into it and killed it only had it for a few months was a little disappointed,27,10
5151,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,this product is ok but sound quality is a little off always sounds like you are down in a tunnel,20,11
5152,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,it is awful a waste of every penny i would not recommend this headset to my worst enemy pluses it is a great design it feels solid minuses it completely broke can not transmit bt after only two trips it is internal components can not be repaired summary i do not know what you are looking for in a bluetooth headset but I had bet it is not a worthless piece of trash my advice look elsewhere,67,12
5153,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i use these to run and around the house when doing yard work i hate the power button and after wearing them for a while they start to hurt my head behind my ears because they kind of clamp right there i also wish the loop over the ears were a little thinner because they push my ears out but i really do like these having no wire when i run is great and i can control the volume and skip through songs from them so i do not have to mess with my phone,94,13
5154,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i purchase these a while back and would get them again if i need them they are the bomb love them thank you,23,14
5155,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,good sound but poor product the charging port broke and got such a run around on getting a replacement had to purchase another product will never order from them again they did not want to take ownership for broken product and made me feel like i owed them something because product broke,52,15
5156,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,these ear buds are easy to use comfortable and unobtrusive they have very good sound and also charge up quickly,20,16
5157,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,low quality the headset last only 3 months later the on / off lever fails never function again light good sound fits well on the ear,24,17
5158,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,ear pieces cracked exposing wires at pre scored flex points in rubber she shall no longer charge most recent attempt to charge headphones overheated and began to melt seeking warranty relief,30,18
5159,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,when the product was first purchased they worked well for about 2 weeks and then they went bad not recommended,20,19
5160,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i use these daily i even wear them on my motorcycle i love having my phone in my pocket and forwarding to the next song if I am not in the mood to hear it or adjusting the volume all while riding down the interstate they sound good and they stand up to a fair amount of hard wear i did finally crack the ear piece at the thin part next to the earbud and it is now got black electrical tape on it but they still work great,87,20
5161,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,bought 2 of these headset late 2012 and both quit working after using them for less than 6 months now I am trying to contact gogroove to use the warranty but they do not return emails and can not find a phone number to call them,43,21
5162,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,got these for my sister for christmas cheap bluetooth headsets that allowed her to workout without any wires i have not heard any complaints from her except that she wished it had an aux input so that she could listen to the tvs while she is running rather than from her phone,52,22
5163,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,these were the most comfortable bluetooth earbuds I have owned decent sound quality my first pair of these lasted a year until one day when i went to charge and it overheated until the plastic began to melt thinking this might be a fluke i decided to replace with another pair the second pair lasted 4 months before the same demise,60,23
5164,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,charger blew within 3 months of having thisand can not locate another this is really bad as the charger is not your average charger and is especially made for thisso i spent 40 on amazon here at the time and it can not be used do not buy thisor you will waste your money or have defective part that can not be replaced too bad it was good while it lasted,74,24
5165,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i like for in confortable to use and carried the sound is stereo a good compatible with many cell not yet playstation,22,25
5166,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,the back band stuck waaaay out in the back and the curves over the ears hovered it was not going to work while working out i do have small ears so it probably would be better for people with larger heads my ears may be 2 1/4 inches from the bottom of my earlobe to the top of the helix and less than an inch between the tragus and where the over-the-ear piece should go on my head,77,26
5167,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,worked well for about 1 month then the charging port and charging cable would not stay together upon docking so i had to use tape to keep them together a new design would cure that but also the on button would not recognize i was pushing it and would not turn on i would have to be relentless to turn the device on the range is not that good for a blue tooth device comfort is ok sound quality is probably the best feature i would not be so upset if i would keep the unit charged and able to turn it on poor buy buyer beware,102,27
5168,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i have had 3 pairs of these the first set i bought of ebay and did not last past the first charge but i thought maybe because they were from ebay so i bought a pair directly from the company once again this new pair worked great right up until they needed charged after that they never worked again luckily i was still with in the warranty period so they sent me a replacement pair for the third and final pair i will ever own of these they lasted about 6 months but that was because i did not use them for 4 months because of an injury and once again this time although they lasted until the second charge save your money do not buy this garbage,125,28

5170,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,not designed for use in moisture and i used it for exercise great sound and connectivity but eventually shorted out and is of no use any more,26,30
5171,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the left side stopped working three days after i got it i do not have the box it came in i guess my bad,23,31

5173,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i purchased this for my workout they really do not stay in very well when you are running and they do not hold a charge long,23,33
5174,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,these headphones worked well for my needs to some degree the controls are not necessarily compatible with all bluetooth devices i believe everyone defaults to apple products and forget that there is a whole other blue tooth world out there and the fit is not the most comfortable with the rigid design that they have but i was able to hear and adjust the volumn and they stayed on while running on a treadmill so they served their purpose in that respect,82,34
5175,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,received these as a gift the left ear phone stopped working after three months hence the two star rating if they were more durable it would have earned a higher rating,31,35
5176,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,it is a great concept but if it does not fit your head well it will just end up being an annoyance i went back to wearing actual headphones,27,36
5177,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,purchased it for my husband no complaints were heard yet it looks cool but did not work with my previous evo 4 g somehow,22,37
5178,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i am very please with this headset it is comfortable and the sound quality is good i love it for the gym,22,38
5179,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,like the headline says it is a temporary hold over until i can another plantronics 903 it is stiff and uncomfortable to wear and yeah it is stiff get the plantronics 903,29,39

5183,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,a friend bought this product and loved it so thought I had give it a try i loved it sound was great easy to operate and lightweight unfortunately my ears became sore after about an hour of use tried all 3 different earbuds but still got sore behind the ears probably just my particular shape as my friend has no issues at all would recommend the product try it for yourself you may have better luck,75,43
5184,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,highly highly recommend this for a wireless way to listen to your music while you run but i also use this for when i lift weights in the gym i even use it for a headset while I am lying down if I am feeling a little lazy you can literally do everything vocally with your phone from this as well if you are listening to music you can flip from playlist to phone call with the push of a button on the headset and switch back immediately after call is over advance songs and turn volume up and down just a great purchase for the price i can not stress enough how happy i am with these wireless earphones exactly what i needed when i run and water proof / sweat proof because i sweat all over these things and they still work just as great buy these,144,44
5185,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,while thewas good the reality is somewhat less so they were just too uncomfortable in the long run,20,45
5186,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,the sound is decent for the price but you would never know because no matter what size ear bud you use the plastic is not built to stay in your ear the arms are not contoured to slant toward your head so you will spend more time bending them back toward your ear than listening to music,54,46
5187,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,very good headset noise reduction could be a little better callers on other end says bluetooth picks up every sound in background,22,47

5191,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i use these to work out i have separate ones for casual listening they have amazing range for a wireless device the bluetooth radio is not the best and may be subject to environmental interference there are some places on campus where it cuts out intermittently but they are always the same places and it works great in the gym they start to hurt my ears for periods longer than 40 minutes and become unbearable after about an hour but they stay in well excellent for bursts the controls on mine have become unseated and difficult but not impossible to operate,100,51
5192,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,it is okay if you do not mind it giving you a blinked red blue death light 90 days later after it shorts out from sweat build up whip it clean when done using it spend the extra for waterproofing,38,52

5196,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i bought a pair of these about a year ago and absolutely loved them the were comfortable did not hurt your ears were easy to use as far as changing a song turning the volume up and down but unfortunately one day they decided not to work and they had been charged the battery indicator light was no longer working either i was out of my window of opportunity to return to ordered another pair the second pair did the same exact thing within 3 months i was able to get my money back on the second pair and have decided to look elsewhere for a pair,106,56
5197,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,it is so bad battery it did n't last for five months i was so wrong to buy this stuff i 'm so upsetto,22,57
5198,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,the set works really well i use it at the gym all the time and have no issues fits ok would rather have wire or something in ear buds to bend and hold in position the only other issue i have is the on / off button is a little tricky and needs improvement otherwise i recommend this product just for the price,61,58
5199,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,good sound price n easy to work but it works only 5 times n no will recommended to anybody,20,59

5203,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,these were a christmas gift for my husband and he loved them he was using them daily the sound was excellent sadly just the other day he went to use them and nothing they just died very disappointed in these only about three weeks of use out of them,49,63

5205,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,works well with my iphone 5 and sound is great for the price use it at the gym would have given it 5 stars if interference did not occur once in a while at the gym,35,65
5206,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,it works great but it is uncomfortable to wear and covers both ears it is not for an office worker but an athlete,23,66
5207,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i was really excited about this product as it is wire free however the back part kinda hangs off if you do not have a big head i think i have a regular sized head but the downside to this product is that it does not have anything to adjust it is just one size this product stopped working about a year after i got it and will not turn on for nothing anymore good desidn but needs to be adjustable,77,67
5208,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,the battery in this device is awesome and works perfectly i use it with my phone during my workout i used with my mac and later on with my desktop pc for my games it is a great value for the price,41,68
5209,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i wanted to like these i was looking for a bluetooth head set that was good for running without having a cord jangling at my neck if that was the only criteria this product fits the need however i can not get used to the irritation on my ears when i wear it it just plain hurts too much it also rides uncomfortably against the back of my neck this is my personal experience I have passed it along to a friend to try out,83,69
5210,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,this rating is based on the answer my son gave me when i asked for his star rating based on five stars he states that the signal drops when he listens to radio style not his favorite as well,39,70
5211,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,fits the neck of kids women or pencil neck geeks good sound abd connects easily to phone myluis it,21,71
5212,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the head phones are convenient the person i called said i was not very loud i got these because i wanted a set of headphones while i work out without cords flopping about the sound quality is fine for a call but comparable to cheap head phones while playing music i got a pair that cuts in and out i will look for a better brand with the same features at my convenience update I am glad that thisis no longer available i bought a new one because this one stopped accepting the charger now this thing is a waste of my time,103,72
5213,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i loved these for running no more tangling cords and they are comfortable enough with a good battery life that i wore them for 2 full marathons i recommended these to every runner i know unfortunately they only lasted 4 months and now they will not charge or turn on i felt that i got my moneys worth but I am trying to get mine replaced,63,73
5214,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,bought for myself they work great i am a marathoner i walk half marathons and when training and doing the marathons no wires to catch on your hands as you are moving i simply love them and no wires is the greatest music has great sound too,42,74
5215,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i admit this thing works beautifully it is very practical easy to wear carry charge and more and it holds an impressive charge for such a small device i use mine about an hour a day and it is over 10 days before it needs recharging the sound is excellent and it is easy enough to operate on / off volume the only problem is the on / off switch is delicate you tend to press too hard since it is not obvious whether you are making contact or not so then in a few months the switch is likely to break having said that i must like the go groove an awful lt since this is my third that I have bought,112,75
5216,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,works super great why pay 250 for others when you can buy this one i honestly thought it was not going to be that great but it works super,28,76
5217,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i wish it could be folded and that the plastic peace that go behind the neck was not there it would also be nice if it gave clearer feedback that it is turned off or on i always doubt what state it is in otherwise it seems well built and stays on my head even when running really hard given it was one of the cheapest sport headsets i was reasonable satisfied,71,77
5218,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the sound starts breaking off right after i stand up it was connected to my laptop my laptop has 40 blue tooth device,23,78
5219,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,battery life is very good i can go a few weeks 1 hour x4 on a single charge i was tired of wires so this fit my needs,28,79
5220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i had a lot of hope for this product when i ordered it but I am beyond disappointed in it now ear pieces were in the areas that did not fit into two ears at the same time when charging it overheated to the point where i could not touch it at all full charge only lasted about one hour sound quality and the microphone quality were horrible stopped functioning after one week,71,80
5221,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,the headset saw about 40 hours of use before it broke down pros compact easy to carry snug fit in ears convenient recharging via usb cable cons battery life after a full charge kept decreasing faster than expected left ear piece broke audio comes only out of the right ear piece i paid over 40 for this device so while the device was not expensive it was not a cheap purchase either the device probably saw around 6 - 8 hours of use in the gym so i am not sure if it had anything to do with sweat,101,81
5222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i like the way the head phones stayed in my ears and the sound was great it was a good buy,21,82
5223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,this gogroove product is better then the motorola and the plantronics buletooth headphones great value for the money good job gogroove,21,83
5224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,it is a litle rough around the ears for extended use but the audio is nice the mic leaves you a little wanting tho this is my 2nd type of stereo bt the quality on this mic was definitely not as clean as my first one in the car w / the fan on med was enuff to have ppl complain of the background noise for the price it worked well paired easily using the buttons to answer callstook a little learning curve but i got used to it then it was stolen i miss it not sure if i will buy this exact type tho as another replacement,105,84
5225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i had previously owned a motorolla product that i liked but the ear buds kept falling off and could not find replacements so i came shopping for a new device on amazon when i saw the gogroove product was a little cheaper i decided to try it at first i was happy with it good sound quality and fewer problems with the ear bud covers but after only a few months the rubber cover that protects the recharging port came off not long after that the device stopped charging i assume without protection moisture and/or dirt got inside that port and caused it to stop charging so i went without my blue tooth until my birthday and received a motorolla device great right no it had problems from the very beginning it fell apart in less than one month and i just mailed it back to the retailer today what do i do now is there no product out there that will work for more than a few weeks / months i am discouraged,171,85
5226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i just want to know if this earphone is compatible with any bluetooth or have a specifications please answer me theis good i have no problems,26,86
5227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,thought they would have been a better fit they are uncomfortable behind the ears and keep falling out of my ears,21,87
5228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,worked fine for a few months the sound was not great but it served it is purpose it died in the first heavy rain,22,88
5229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this is a good product considering that you get what you pay for a stereo bluetooth headset where it falls short is that the plastic that goes around your head makes it impossible to enjoy if you are leaning back resting your head on a seat so if you want to listen to music while sitting back in an airplane sat forget it if you want to watch tv on your laptop while resting your head back forget it update u dropped my headset from about 2 feet and the controller knobs broke i do not think i charged the head set more than half a dozen times totally useless,109,89
5230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,it needed to be bigger and it was not connecting to the computer well perhaps it needs a driver to install it worked with with the samsung,26,90
5231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i will admit at the beginning i was scared of breaking them easily but this is my second pair i lost the first one by placing it in the door of the car and while getting out knocking them off great build quality great sound has not sync off one sinlge time since purchase would recommend to anyone walk / run under the rain various times with it and still working a must ahve,72,91
5232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i ordered these for my sons birthday i had it set so it would arrive on his birthday but the seller sent them and i received them the day before my sons birthday he is a happy camper they are great for the gym or any device that is bluetooth he even uses it on his psp,57,92
5233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,purchased this product to use 3 times per week for treadmill running it will no longer take a charge and is now completely useless as in dead after 2 months of use the only thing i can say that is positive about this product is that it is comfortable while it lasts do not waste your money on this product,57,93
5234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,it seemed to be a good thing sound is good better with an equlizer app functionality good untill it lost line of sight when i put my phone in my pocket what amazon is great i sent it back and got the lg 700 over the new 730 way better the new 730 seens to have the same pocket issue go figure,62,94
5235,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,headphones came in earlier than expected bluetooth works great with my iphone these do not fall off and sounds great i have not tried a phonecall on them but for running using itunes pandora any run app they are excellent thanks,39,95
5236,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,let me start off by saying i had high hopes for these headphones they are a great price and were super comfortable sound quality was not great but it was acceptable for headphones in this price range with that said i quickly had my hopes let down by this product the design of this product is an epic fail the headphones have toggle switches which are exposed to the environment this causes sweat to build up and because a short once the toggle switch fails you can no longer turn the device on or off this effectively makes them useless mine failed within 3 weeks of use it was a total bummer but amazon gave me my money back overall fails on this device 1 not a bit of water resistance 2 the device uses a propriety cable so you can not charge it with a normal micro usb 3 the sound quality is okay but lacked low high end sound the speakers are very geared toward midrange tones do yourself of a favor and spend 10 - 20 bucks more on motorola headphones and you will be happy,185,96
5237,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i bought these to replace a motorola wireless headset this one is better in lower price and the speakers fit in your ears the old set the speakers tried to fit over your ear canal so i would lose sound when sweaty these require wearing the phone on my right arm so the antenna works without interruption reception was much better on the motorola the sound is good and easily adjusted the on off button is sometimes hard to activate bit once activated the device is more reliable in connecting to my phone than my old headset overall i am happy with the product but wish the antenna had better reception,111,97
5238,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,quick charge sound is mono not stereo ok and reasonably comfortable when going jogging or workout bluetooth pairing with smartphones and tablets a breeze but without any rough handling the right earbud suddenly stopped delivering sound i thought there was a balance issue but found out there no such adjustment exists so now i have an audioactive that only delivers sound on the left earbud bummer time to shop for another reliable bluetooth headset,74,98
5239,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,arrived earlier than posted works great no trouble with the mic picking up other noise it seamlessly switches from stereo head set to mono for phone use,27,99
5240,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this product has echo problems the mix in this headset is unforgiving and uncontrolable the controls of this device are not very good and hard to use even with the simplicity of use the mix is high ended and the tinny it will loop different high frequencies,46,100
5241,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,the go groove is ok for a cheap headset here are the things i do not like the power switch / mode switch is integrated into the volume switch and it is really a pain in the butt to use it is sometimes hard to pair up to my phone i have a motorola droid running 22 it is not comfortable to wear for any length of time more than an hour and you are ready to take it off it rubs the rims of my ears funny especially if I am trying to use it with sunglasses on so much for taking this thing running to get rid of the cable to my headphones i now pretty much only use it to listen to music while i work out as long as you do not mind that it hangs off the back of your head about 2 - 3 inches it is really oversized and non-adjustable then it is great for that using it for phone calls the mic does not have noise cancelling so it catches wind noise really bad even from my car vents and if you use it to call then you have to turn it off unpair it and then turn it back on and repair it in order to hear music again this does not happen with my motorola blue-tooth just this one so I am pretty sure it is the headset not my phone if you do not like that fact then you will have to either pay more for a better headset or just have this for music and something else for hands-free calls not exactly convenient overall the music quality is great and the battery life is good but the functionality and design are horrible i would not recommend this unit,286,101
5242,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,if they had separate customer service ratings i would give that 5 stars but the quality of these headphones are 1 star i have just sent the headphones back for the 3rd time the first 2 the battery stopped charging nowhy the latest is the buttons stopped working so i could not turn it on or off or anything they have replaced them all 3 times but just a hassle in general,73,102
5243,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i can not praise this product enough it comes in so handy when you want to be on the move within your home stereo sound not mono i use them for more than exercise great for driving as long as you do not push them completely into your ears so you can still hear what has going on around you talk time is wonderful and it is not that expensive you also do not have to worry about losing it because of how it hooks around your ears it may come out of your ear but it will not fall off,100,103
5244,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i take the subway every day and with the crowds / backpack and my ear buds cable it is a pain in the butt so i opted for some bluetooth ear buds i usually watch a number of pod cast on my phone and for this reason these s ear buds are fine they do the job hold a charge for a few days and i just throw them in my backpack with no problems but i also like my tunes and for this they are not so good unless the volume is turned down to a very low setting which i can not do on the subway they sound very tinny / cheap i have also tried using them when i walk my dog in the evening and well maybe it is me but again unless turn down they again do not sound so good but as for using them with my phone very good my friends tell me no background noise even when walking down a busy street or standing on a subway platform I have also had them out in the rain with no damage so if you are looking for an entry level bluetooth headset this may be it for you low price point but if your looking for good music sound you might want to keep looking billamac,214,104
5245,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,they have workd good sofar just got this friday 9 - 29 - 2012charge them up and test the stereo and the mic for cell work good fit comfortable on me and the fact that ther water resistant i work and sweat alot as i work so i hope they will last me a long time my friend has a pair simeler to this they cost him 80 dollars at local wallstore so time will tell from here also they ship fast and arived fully packed new in the box,86,105
5246,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i can not hold it in any more i keep seeing people running in the street park and trails holding their iphone with earbuds i feel like stopping them and showing them this device bluetooth music phone please oh and i have no ownership in this thing I have been using it for about a year really st louis put this on your christmas wish list if you afford an iphone you can afford this,73,106
5247,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,for the price you really can not complain too much but i have had mine for several months with several complaints i have not been able to get the buds to fit in my ears even with the different buds they included i read a review from a bike rider who complained about the same issue that caused air noise when he rode fast mine would not allow me to answer my phone when i was listening to sirius / xm or pandora while running sporadically my biggest complaint is that a few weeks ago my headset will not turn off i have to let run down and charge them before i run there is no helpdesk for this product either and a week later it stopped working completely,125,107
5248,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,good not great works well when dry but i bought them for the gym sweat seems to affect it starts to skip and if you have a fred flintstone head which i do the fit is a little tight,39,108
5249,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i bought these earbuds about 6 months ago and immediately loved them the fit was good controls were simple and it made my workouts much more enjoyable not having to worry about wires hanging all over the place for the first 3 or 4 months i told everyone how great these things were then after a mild run 30 mins on an unseasonably warm day i had these things dripping in sweat mind you i did not submerge them in water or anything just sweat i laid them out for a full day before i attempted to recharge them to make sure they were entirely dry when the time came they would not take a charge pair or even turn on they are now a paperweight sitting on my desk everything started so well if you plan to use them for light recreational use i would still recommend if you plan to push the limits and get these things dirty / sweaty i would look elsewhere,161,109
5250,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,it worked perfectly on my ipod touch the quality of the sound is just amazing it is like if you put the sound louder you can not hear anything around you,29,110
5251,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,in short great battery life a little tight fit at least for those of us with broad noggins mediocre yet perfectly adequate sound it paired perfectly with my iphone 4s the power skip pause and volume buttons feel a little flimsy but after 6 months of using these i have not had a singe performance issue you have to hold the power button down a little awkwardly long but that is an easy thing to get used to they come with three different sized ear pieces and even after putting on the largest ones they will still slip out the moment i start to sweat i actually run with the ear buds hanging loosely against my ears rather than in my ear canal which works perfectly well all that said I am actually rather happy with these especially at a very competitive price,140,111
5252,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,with my first phone it did not work right htc aria but when i got the motorola atrix it worked perfectly and i was relatively happy however it stopped working altogether within 3 months and i have yet to be able to get it to come on even after charging it I am not sure if it is because i live in a humid environment or because i sweat i used it for jogging in the morning but if that is the case then it is not very well made,85,112
5253,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,these headphones work pretty well occasionally i will have trouble connecting them to my phone but it has not bothered me too much i will probably eventually upgrade to headphones with better sound quality but these are a great starter pair,40,113
5254,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i use this weekly for indoor and outdoor running i wear my iphone 4 in a spibelt around my waist and never have connection issues there is volume control and song rewind / forward controls on the headset the charge seems to last a long time but i have not tracked how much usage i get out of one charge sometimes the ear piece hurts the behind my ears but i can usually adjust it to get a comfortable fit this headset has worked better than i ever expected i would definitely purchase it again,92,114
5255,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,bought this for my fiance for christmas but i was so excited that i gave it to him early they fit too right on his head and in the third day they snapped in half we had to throw them away and i ended up buying him some different ones really bummed out i was going to order myself a pair but the quality was not at all what i expected,67,115
5256,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,I am really happy with this product these are the things to have it is so much better than corded headphones they play loud but can be a bit confusing when dealing with the buttons it is only 2 buttons but they serve a wide range of functions for your device i have an iphone 4s and they work for all functions that are available all functions my not work on various devices so make sure you check product info so you do not waste your money other than that its a great buy this is my third pair i like them so much i brought some for friends happy,106,116
5257,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,after looking for wireless headsets this was the most reasonably priced for what was needed it functions as i had intended and can handle the sweat from running around with them I have twisted the earbuds accidently and they still work fine so I am counting these as rugged i do not purposely throw them around or anything i am pleased with the sound quality and I am able to drown out all the ambient noise in the subway as well,77,117
5258,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i bought a pair of these wireless headsets because i was tired of catching my hand on the wire when i run at first i thought these were great told all my friends it was a must have but now i have had them for about 7 months and they have died i can charge them but when i go to use them they do not turn on i also bought a pair for my husband right after mine and his died 2 months earlier i would never recommend this product to anyone anymore and the only reason i gave 2 stars is because at one point i thought they were great do not waste your money,117,118
5259,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,after getting frustrated this morning i figured it was time for a review on these i bought these about 3 months ago wanting to go wireless as i hate running with wires but I am not sure these were the best option I shall keep this short and sweet from a technical standpoint they work great and do what they are supposed to I had give them 5 stars in that category from a functionality standpoint they come up way short if you wanted something to just wear around the house these would be fine but if you are looking at these for running working out or anything where you are moving or sweating I had say move on because of the design you have to bend these to get them to put them on and after doing this a few times I have found you constantly have one side coming out of your ear and are having to stick it back in over and over if you get sweat on the ear buds you can forget about it I have tried to bend them inward but to no avail it can make for quite a frustrating experience I had give them 15 stars in the functionality category if you are looking for something for exercise look elsewhere i wish i had went with the lg tone and will probably purchase them in the near future i wish you could give half stars I had give an overall of 25 since i can not i m just giving them 3 since technically they do work,255,119
5260,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,in general i like the headphones very light in weight easy to connect with phone and when you just charge them they work ok i can use them for some hours with no problems but when i charge them and not use them immediately after a couple days they just will not turn on unless i charge them again this is really not cool having to charge them pretty much every time you want to use them but again worth the price and work really good in general,87,120
5261,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,my emails to go groove have gone unanswered used the headset a couple of times a week while driving and around the house very light use plugged it in one night and it just did not charge do not waste your money very disappointed with this product and the nonexistent customer service,52,121
5262,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,ok i am a fat guy trying to get in shape i go to the local ymca and workout like a insane person trying to drop weight as a fat guy i sweat a lot this is why i purchased this my earbuds i buy for my iphone fall out as sweat pours out also having corded earbuds results in them getting yanked out during workouts just got this yesterday and went right to the gym did a full workout and they worked perfectly they stay in my ears and i can hear it well i also wore them on my motorcycle with my 3/4 helmet and it provided nice sound while riding my bike i do not know about talking on them i would not expect good performance in that as the mic is nowhere near your mouth so i would expect it to pick up a lot of background noise but for a wireless headset i have no initial complaints,162,122
5263,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this product is one that is short term in life span so if you do not mind paying money for something that may last a couple months this is the product for you just make sure if you are using it at the gym or in some type of physical activity that you do not sweat this product is suseptiple to electric short outs because of possible sweating i think it sucks,71,123
5264,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,poor quality my husband and i have gone through 4 sets of these headphones when they actually work they work well sound is good fit is relatively comfortable and the controls are easy to use however the first two sets we purchased stopped working within 2 months would not charge or turn on we purchased two more sets one set stopped working within a month and a half again would not charge or turn on and the other set stopped working in one earbud so sound only came out of one side we gave this company way too many chances time to try something new,107,124
5265,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,these headphones were fantastic the three weeks they worked although you could tell there was a reason they were so cheap the sound was great and so was the fit i used them to run and do not sweat profusely however after 3 weeks the lights started going crazy and now the device will not connect do not buy these,59,125
5266,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i bought this product may 14 2012 it is suppose to be a sports use product a little over a month later it stopped working the instuctions read that it can not get wet but on the advertisement it is not stated anywhere that it can not get wet a sports use product that can not get wet does not make any since,59,126
5267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this product was less than satisfactory when i plugged in to a power source for charging it overheated turning on the headset is extremely difficult and the buttons are not easy to figure out i can not imagine anyone being able to use this product for more than a few days before disposing of it i would totally return the product but did not have the packaging i feel like anyone who buys this product will feel cheated as i do this product was without a doubt the most dissatisfying experience I have had in many many years,96,127
5268,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,it is ok very easy to set up and use but it has tight fit around neck and exerts a lot of pressure behind the ears no adjustment,27,128
5269,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i am very on happy with thisit goes in and out all the time while i am on the phone and the phone be right next to it to be truth full it is louslyand i would like to return it,45,129
5270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,these completely stopped working after only a few months and the vendor wants money and is making me jump through all kinds of hoops to get a replacement they are ok when working not super comfortable although I had skip any product made by go groove,44,130
5271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,well it started out good with these headphones they did as promised I am a runner and weightlifter they only lasted 2 months now they will not take a charge and the ear bud piece just broke in half they are hanging by the wires connected pros good connection great volume easy to use con they do not last that long will not recharge and broke easy if you are an avid athletic person like myself please look into getting these philips accessories shb6017/28 bluetooth stereo headset black or these miikey wireless miisport stereo bluetooth headphones for iphone bluetooth headset retail packaging red they are the best quality,107,131
5272,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i bought these for exercise and they worked well for about two months over time sweat warped the casing on the earpieces and they eventually stopped working the controls were responsive and they sounded ok if you are not planning on wearing these for exercise they are an inexpensive option if you are planning to work out with them I had look elsewhere,60,132
5273,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,this headset is great good sound good quality and all in general good that being said you may wonder why my review is two stars it may be called a sports headset but it is not the most durable I have had them for around three months now and they have served me well until recently where the headsets own product design started to because it to break right around the earbuds there are holes in the plastic casing most likely to help with flexibility but these holes are right on the stress points so if you bend them when taking them off chances are they will last about as long as mine did maybe even less I have done nothing to them but wear and use them,124,133
5274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,the good synced immediately with my lg optimus elite droid no problems with signal drop out decent sound fidelity stayed in place during running the bad after my initial battery charge it no longer would charge using either the supplied power pack or my computer while plugged in the led did not illuminate nor did any recharging occur somewhat uncomfortable the ear piece did not surround my ear rather it crossed over the top if it after a long listening session my ear got sore returned and bought the lg bluetooth headset instead,91,134
5275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i have a love-hate relationship with these headphones i have purchased 4 sets of the gogroove audioactive over the past 2 years when they work they are fantastic the problem is that they always stop working and can not be recharged i keep hoping that the next pair that i buy will be different and hold the charge better but i end up disappointed make sure that you register your product with accessory power within the first 30 days of purchase or you will not be eligible for the 3 year warranty the headphones pair quickly have pretty good range when connected to my htc evo 4 g and i love the controls for the volume and track forward and reverse buttons the fit is great they fit over the ears and the earbuds provide a snug fit in the ears to block out most noises i wear them when I am mowing the grass and can hear music or podcasts without problem but eventually without warning the battery just dies and i can not recharge them i have spoken with reps from accessory power they state that they are aware of the problem and are attempting to improve battery life with future versions the last 2 pair that i have purchased have failed after 20 days and 32 days respectively from the date that i received them as of today i do not know if I shall take theand get another set but if i do I shall be sure to register them so i get my warranty protection,254,135
5276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i was excited about the prospect of the whole wireless bluetoothbut gogroove inc quickly put an end to that I am on my thrid pair in less than 3 months the first broke after just 3 weeks and the return process was a nightmare when finally after 3 weeks of waiting recieved my 2nd replacement those broke within the week the thrid pair did not work right out the box warning stay away from this company and it is products if you remember the credit card commercial where the guy pretends to be a lady on the phone expect that no less i am so disgusted with the product and service i almost do not care about geeting my money back especially since i was informed that i can not get my money back because the product is not discontinued the only option given is an exchange yeah right,146,136
5277,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,this product is well worth the money i thought it was cutting out but it was when i touched the i-pod that it cut outif u go to the gym this headset is worth the invesment,35,137
5278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,poor battery life right speaker went out after about a dozen workouts bought a motorola sd-10 and it is the real deal,22,138
5279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,pretty excited about price bluetooth connection worked easily and sound was pretty good sitting down once i started moving around outside it immediately started cutting in and out switch arms and it still could not keep a solid connection checked website for help found nothing useful if you plan on listening to music in a chair go for the purchase if you plan on exercising or in my case light gardening you would be better off finding something else i know i have to now i returned product less than 12 hours after opening box,93,139
5280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,worked great for the first 45 days or so then the red light stopped working to indicate charge charge went from 7 hours to less than an hour even when charged overnight of course it went kaput after the return window expire not liking amazon nearly as much as i used to like them do not buy thisamazon stop selling thisplease it sucks and it makes you suck,71,140
5281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i must say that I am really not satisfied with this product simply because it is quite uncomfortable I have preferred a much more flexible band,23,141
5282,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,these headphones get the job done and for a great price the earplugs sometimes fall off but they sent extra i think as an improvement they should offer a more durable charger and better battery life,36,142
5283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the title says it all the charging cable is not a mini or micro usb cable it is a proprietary connector type another cable to keep up with also the ear loops that go over the top of the ear is non-adjustable and made of a very hard plastic wear it more than 45mins and the top of where your ear connects to your head starts burning because it rubs badly also the ear plugs themselves do not stay in your ear canal they pop out because the headset is so stiff,90,143
5284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,when i first bought these headphones they where great they where the first pair that seemed to fit my head perfectly they where very easy to sync to my phone the sound was ok but for just working out they where great especially being about 10 - 20 dollars cheaper than comparable sets i am using the past tense because like other reviewers said these will short out on you i run about 5 - 6 miles a day and these lasted me less than 2 months i was also on vacation for 2 of those weeks so they lasted me a grand total of 6 weeks maybe 30 hours worth of exercise if you are looking for a pair of sport headphones do not be fooled by the low price if you are active they will not last,134,144
5285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,product arrived in sound condition and works as advertised good sportswear it has worked perfectly for my p90x sessions in the morning while everyone is asleep,25,145
5286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,was working good then 3 months later it just stopped working would not take a charge once i start sweating from the workout they keep coming out my ears not a snug fit,33,146
5287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,have only used it a hand full of times and already will not charge charging port is defective cord will not stay in,22,147
5288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,got exactly what i ordered and exactly on time my husband works with them and says thy are great he really liked not having to use his hands to answer the phone or turn his music on,37,148
5289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i loved thebut the charger part of the earpiece melted somehow i would have give thisa five star if it was able to connect to multiple electronics from your ipad to your cellphone,36,149
5290,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,ordered this for my sons birthday which is today 5/14/2012 my husband and i also have them we like them works great my son really likes them shipping was excellent,30,150
5291,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i ordered this headset and was unable to work out before the return date expired when i finally opened and tried to charge i discovered the the usb cable enclosed does not fit i went to two national electronics stores locally and they did not even carry a cable with that type of end very disappointed that i have a brand new product that is worthless,65,151
5292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i am realy upset that this product stop working before the end of the month of receiving it in the beginning worked just fine then one day i put it on the charger and when i tried to turn it on nothing happen,43,152
5293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i read the reviews other buyers had written and they accurately describe the product i just wanted a pair of headphones to wear while jogging and these fit the bill i was surprised when i received a phone call and was able to talk through the headset using this headset for long conversations may not be perfect as the quality was a little shaky but it was simple enough for a short conversation easily synced with my android razr volume control and next track functions both work great several customers noted that the signal cuts out every now and then and this is true it seems to have about a 4 foot range just enough to pick it up when the phone is in my pocket but it occasionally loses it is signal for a split second while jogging no big deal overall a great buy for the price,148,153
5294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,loved the design lightweight and audio is crystal clear whether I am listening to music on my cell phone or on a call when i go to the gym this headset does not jog out of place while I am on the treadmill I have seen similar styles that were more expensive great product cost and easy to operate while earplugs fit comfortably [ you can still hear sirens converse with others ] the headset does not weigh down your on your neck practically hidden from view and when you need to take them out of your ears there has no need to hold it as it rests comfortably on your neck very practical for anyone who does sports or is a spectator in the bleachers for the comfort and cost i would highly recommend this hands-free head-set,129,154
5295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,the gofroove audioactive headset hooked up quickly and was easy to begin using after about 20 uses it started cutting in and out during my runs then would just quit i would not recommend it for active use because obviously it can not handle any moisture,44,155
5296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,here i am frustrated why it will not charge used the plug for the wall does not work use the usb it came with still waiting for the red light to come on to know it is charging nothing do not buy thisuntil they find out why it stops working,49,156
5297,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i purchased the headset because i needed a comfortable and solid headset to use while i run and cycle i was done with wires danging and bouncing around as well as ear buds falling out of my ears pros this headset was perfect and exactly what i was after it fits very comfortably in my ears and on my head / neck great sound with good bass response does not bounce around while i run and even allows my sunglasses to sit on my ears cons the only negative is the range i can not wear my phone on my left arm and receive un-interruptable music through the receiver which is on the right side of the headset so the signal does not go through my head i guess anyways easy fix put my phone on the right arm and it is good to go i have recommended this to a few friends already,153,157
5298,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this is not designed to get wet in any manner if you sweat just a little it will break mine lasted 45 days before it broke do not waste your money find something else it is also uncomfortable behind the ear so i can not even recommend it if you are only going to listen to music and use for a phone,60,158
5299,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,this product worked pretty well it charged quickly and the battery life was about a week with running 30 - 60 minutes a day x 5 days sound was ok still allowed me to hear road noise which was fine since i run on roads however after 5 months it decided to stop working one day would not power on or charge have not decided what to replace it with wireless headphones definitely an advantage have to do some more research,77,159
5300,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the headphones were perfect until the right side speaker went dead i enjoyed these headphones for about a month before i lost sound on the right side i used these phones while i played ball and they worked out beatifully i listened to music and was able to answer my phone while on the field they almost seemed to good to be true the shoe finally dropped and i have no sound on the right side at all,75,160
5301,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,the sound from this set is good and it is very light however unless you plan to use the headset only when walking or bikeing i do not recommend it the earbud connector does not go over your head but only around the back of your neck it is very hard and is not adjustable i sometimes like to listen to music using my iphone at night silently so as not to disturb my spouse but this headset gives me a neck pain instead of calming sound also i tried to clean the earbuds and they fell apart had to order a new headset,104,161
5302,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i really wanted to love these headphones setup was easy range was great i like to listen to music while cooking or cleaning my apartment and i could put down my iphone anywhere in the apartment and continue to enjoy music no matter where i moved around to the sound was clear and no pesky cords to get tangled up in however i found the headphones to be very uncomfortable the big part that sits behind your ears pressed on the side of my head which not only hurt after a little while but also acted as a lever to continuously pop the earbuds out of my ears i had to keep pressing them into my ears to get them to stay also any time i bent down the back of the headphone would hit the back of my neck and shift the headphones out of place a big plug for the company i bought them from accessory genie they emailed me a few days after i received the headphones inquiring how i liked them as it is a new product they are carrying i was honest and they responded very quickly and helpfully told me what i could do to return theif i was not completely happy i called amazon and they issued a return label right away not sure what product i will try next but I shall definitely review my next attempt as well,239,162
5303,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i purchased thisduring my deployment to afghanistan thisis very hard to power on you have to push the button wait a few second and if your lucky it will power most of the time you have to wiggle the power button to get it started i mainly used it for my gym workout when it worked during the 2nd month of ussage the only way to power off thewas to severed the blue tooth connection and it would eventually time itself off ended up in the trash after it started making beeping sounds every 5 minutes even after being fully charged back to regular wire earbuds but at least i do not waste time getting this thing to work save your money and look for something else,132,163
5304,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,these are exactly what i wanted i needed a headset that would be wireless to listen to music and be able to work out at the same time got tired of getting tangled and earplug headphones falling off they are also great with calls the only thing that i think should be fixed is that maybe have the mic be more pronounced or at least point it out i still have no clue where the microphone is located with that said be sure there is no background noise when you talk because the mic will pick it up and the people you are talking to will definitely hear it even if you do not but overall this product is awesome great buy definitely will recommend,124,164
5305,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,sound is great price is great and i love that they do not bounce out of my ears while I am running the one complaint i have is that they can get a little uncomfortable with the way they apply pressure to the area behind your ears and sometimes need to be moved or it can get pretty painful would be great if they were adjustable to better accommodate my bulbous melon but otherwise they are great and i recommend a purchase,80,165
5306,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i have had several bluetooth headsets for working out and these are not nearly as nice as the s9 headsets from motorola the motorola headsets are not very sweat proof however these headsets are not very comfortable and the sound quality is mediocre it is difficult to find and press the buttons overall i am much more impressed with the motorola s9 hd headsets,65,166
5307,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,initially i was concerned because of the price it seemed to be pretty cheap for the listed features i was concerned enough to read nearly every review both good and bad regarding other buyers experience with this product i think you have to realize that not every buyer is going to be happy with their purchase of anything they buy especially online you are always going to have someone that has some issue with the product i decided to go with this headset and am very glad i did i have experienced none of the issues reported by some other buyers i have an iphone 3gs and the headset paired quickly with the phone i am no audiophile but the sound quality is as good as any wired headsets i have used in the past i am a field service technician and bought these to use while working on equipment in the field and flying back and forth to job sites i have had no problems with the headset slipping or with comfort during long time usage i would recommend this headset to anyone,183,167
5308,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,design 3/5 typical of such headsets nothing stands out as particularly good or bad fits nicely fit / comfort 3/5 i ran with the headset outdoors it fits nicely with the loop behind your neck you can turn your head freely and the set feels light the area behind my ears did get somewhat uncomfortable after 30 - 40 minutes of running durability 0/5 maybe I am just unlucky but reading the reviews it appears to happen often it worked for me for one charge only when it ran out of battery i was not able to charge it again with either wall connector or via usb the charge did last 10 days with 1 hour usage every day sound 2/5 overall 1/5 inexpensive product that seems to work just like any other competing products it worked okay when it did died after 10 days of usage now sits on top of a pile of stuffs i can / will no longer use my advise figure out return / refund / exchange policy before considering buying,168,168
5309,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i basically like the product the sound fidelity was a concern for me and the product has performed beyond my expectations the convenience of being wireless is why i bought the product and has proven to be much better than fooling around with wires especially when exercising however the controls are difficult to operate and know what mode the unit is in i usually have to take the unit off my head and look to see what is going on if i had to buy the product again i certainly would despite the problem listed above,96,169
5310,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,what is this what is this what is this this can not be what i ordered because this is a piece of garbage after 2 weeks of being able to hear music through the headphones not even judas priest the same people who designed this thing must have designed the death star because there is some huge flaw here which renders this device useless i thought for a second my life was mission impossible because after listening to one song my headphones self destructed within 5 seconds now my wallet is empty and I am stuck with my second pair of headphones because the first pair broke too these guys know they are selling a faulty product and they do not recall it off the market so guys like you and me have to suffer returning this pile every time i replace it these people are crooks do not give them a dime buy the motorola s-10 instead i should have bought them in the first place,163,170
5311,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i love this headset because it stays put while i am on the bike running or otherwise doing something that requires great amounts of mobility and head movement once you get used to the little bit weird angle of entry it is a great product and does exactly what it is intended to do,54,171
5312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i use the head phones for every thing work working out they work great i love that when i have a phone call i can answer the call and talk wright on the head phones their great head phones with a great price,44,172
5313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i found this device met my expectations as expected the product worked fine out of the box and functioned as described my only complaint is that the unit is slightly bulkier than i would like the reason i say that is after those long workouts i always do and i am about to pass out and lay down i have to remove the device or have it poke into the back of my head this makes it difficult to call the paramedics that being said i find the unit completely acceptable as is,93,173
5314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,these have been great so far i use them everyday at work while I am doing my main job and then unloading trucks no matter where i go they hardly cut out and the sound is very clear and music sounds great no matter the genre they are pretty comfortable i did have to take down some sharp edges where the two halves meet just because I am ocd about stuff like that i was able to pair them with no trouble to my ipod touch 27 in imac and ibook with out issue price was right and they shipped fast,98,174
5315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i have been happy with them i use them with an adapter on my tv output and use them to listen to the tv they are comfortable and hold a charge quite well the range is pretty good too i can go to other rooms and still hear works well for leaving during commercials to do things and knowing when the show is back on,65,175
5316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i got these headphones to use with my droid bionic i thought they did not work with voice dial the button combination in the instruction manual did not work and i actually returned them to get another pair at the recommendation of the manufacturer the second pair had the same problem so we decided it was software related to my phone in the meantime i figured out how to use the voice dial i have to have music playing and then push the button that forwards and rewinds and hold it for a couple seconds toward forward i noticed my phone is not listed as compatible but at least i found a work around i love them for running and the price was great i like knowing my kids can call me while I am out on a run if they need anything same as others have said they are not for fancy sound but for a workout great,154,176
5317,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,unit quite working after 15 months i wore this unit mainly when running at the gym so maybe it is just not built strong enough to handle the sweat and bouncing involved pros i liked the fit sound was ok but not great once ear buds were securely in ear bluetooth range seemed ok to me no dropouts with droid phone on arm band cons uses proprietary usb connector on the headphone end these means i can not use one of the many mini or micro usb cords i have lying around to charge it broke after less than 2 months i switched to the motorola sd-10 which has it is own problems but durability does not appear to be one of them,124,177
5318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,this bluetooth headset is a great product i was initially looking for ear buds or something with a simple wire around your neck kept reading reviews of those devices that were twice the price of this one my husband finally ordered one of these since the price was good we both used it and loved it we bought another one so we each could use them i have small ears and some ear buds make my ears hurt this one is perfect for me comes with three sizes of ear pieces they seem to suction in your ear when placed appropriately i have used them to walk run elliptical bike and weight lifting the bluetooth sync if easy the sound is better than the wired headset i was using i am using it with the android incredible my husband uses an iphone 4s highly recommend to anyone,147,178
5319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i ordered this set of headphones to use when i work out they are not the comfiest in the world i have no problem pairing them with my droid x and the sound was okay not outstanding but okay the headphones are design to rest on your ears and then you have to push the ear buds into your ears this design is flawed only because when i would move at all which i happen to move alot when i work out the ear buds did not stay in my ears to clarify the headphones stayed on my head while the ear buds would fall out greatly reducing comfort and music quality so bottom line is that if you want a pair of headphones for when you are not moving alot they i would say consider these as a last resort but other than that i say avoid these,148,179
5320,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i ordered these on march 21st i received them on march 23rd i used them on march 24th for a 8 mile run they work great they fit good of course i had to use the bigger ear gels but that is what they are there for it did not rain that day but i did sweat a lot and had not one issue i use them with my lifeproof case to eliminate the need for wired headphones i have the sports arm band and all during my run the music played without any drop outs i can even skip songs without stopping just using the headset i have not yet received any calls on these but when i do i will update this to let you know how they work for calls as for the music they work fine this is one purchase i am very happy i made i would recommend these oh yeah i also used them when i was cleaning house and i could go from room to room without losing signal grant it i never went more then 20 feet from the iphone but they worked fine 5 stars from me 6/10/12 update update my gogroove bluetooth headset has quit working i have had the since march 23rd not even 3 months and they are dead i am very disappointed i am going to contact the company these worked really great up to june 8th on june 9th i went to run my 10k race and bam they did not work dead will not even turn on luckily i brought my wired headphones along too i just tried them again and they do nothing 07/08/12 no reply from the email i sent the company i will not get these again i went with phillips,292,180
5321,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,because i had never heard of the brand name gogroove i did not at first buy them but instead tried others that did not work out the sound was bad and they did not hold a charge but gogroove stated would work on a long list of brand names such as apple and because i wanted them for my ipad i ordered them they have stereo sound long charge capability and it does not take long to charge when they do need one and one other big thing the other headsets i had to re-pair every time i used them very inconvenient but with gogroove once they have been paired you have only to turn them on and your ready to go so i highly recommend these headsets have an ipad or ipod use these they also have great customer service I have used them and they got back to me immediately and fixed the problem within no time thank you gogroove,159,181
5322,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,good product was delivered at the date expected i thought the sound would be better did not try the mic yet but i bought for my sundays bike ride so if you are looking for a mid level quality sound earphones for outdoors activities that is what your are looking for,51,182
5323,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i bought these hoping they are more water resistant that my previous wireless headset i have not done intense cardio sessions since purchasing these so i can not account for their water resistance these are generally uncomfortable and very stiff but that is easy to get used to that after wearing them for a while the controls are easy to use which is nice but the sound quality is absolutely horrible there is absolutely zero bass and everything sounds washed out if you are looking for some decent wireless headphones / headset and you do not need ones which are water / sweat resistant then look at plantronics backbeat 903 they are 1000 more and the sound quality is absolutely amazing in comparison they are also incredibly comfortable to wear,125,183
5324,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,this was a gift for christmas and in the 3 months I have had it have had more negatives than positives first i can not say the fit is very good i do have a large head 7 5/8 cap size which could be the reason but would think a headset would be able to adjust right recently the headset does not seem to want to stay connected i use this primarily for a cordless headset when excercising and it is constanly cutting out very distracting when running and music is cutting in / out i just read another post about the battery not holding a charge after 3 months perhaps that is the problem overall not very satisfied with this product unfortunatly the original packaging is long gone so probably no chance of returnng it,132,184
5325,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,my wife has used her headphones almost every day since i got them for her they came on time were easy to sync with her iphone and they have worked perfectly she loves them,33,185

5327,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,outstanding piece of head gear i purchased this product thinking that the sound quality would be ok i was pleasently surprised to find out that the sound was far from just ok but excellent the fit is surprisingly comfortable as well i am able to perform cardio and weight training movements with little to no adjustment of the headset,59,187
5328,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i have had two units the first operated well for three weeks the second for six weeks because the second lasted long enough to make it out of warrantee i will not be getting a third both were used under normal athletic conditions and treated with appropriate care i can only assume it is bad engineering if you do not want to throw away your money look elsewhere,66,188
5329,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,it works great my son uses it with his ipod while running the earbud head set stays in place great the wireless set up was simple,26,189
5330,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,took this thing out for my first usage paired the headphones to my iphone put the iphone in my arm band sounded great when standing still as soon as i started running i could not get steady audio what so ever the combination of my arm moving in a running motion the bodys natural movements the bluetooth connection not staying had to shut off the headphones and finish my run in silence returned the headphones today,77,190
5331,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,these bluetooth headphones have a very nice sound for the price it is no bose surround sound but there is no cloudiness and the bass is solid overall there is very good range to the sounds i recommend them they were found and connect very easily with my iphone 3gs and i can not complain about anything yet they do not fall out of your ears when working out or running that is a plus there are no wires to get in the way,82,191
5332,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i bought these bluetooth headphones for running and working out because i was burning through 1 pairs of skull candy earbuds a month running with my phone in my pocket was damaging the jack these headdphones work great fit comfortably and the call acceptance feature is great too great product,50,192
5333,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,so i received these on time and it is all good the sound quality of these head phones are freaking amazing i use them every day for about a hour or so and only have to charge them once a week or so the only down side i have to agree would be the weird usb plug since they are not very common so you have to make sure you keep up with them i can not wait to see how they do when i cut the grass,85,193
5334,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,product is amazing i did not know what to expect since this was my first bluetooth headset but i am very happy with it fast shipping too,26,194
5335,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,total piece of crap i bought this headphone but after using it only 5 times it stopped working it seems that the battery is dying since the indicator lights are very very weak and i can not make it work anymore once again do not buy this product,47,195
5336,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i bought this hoping that it would be better than my prior bluetooth headset experiences with moto rokr i use these headsets for running the moto headsets failed in a few months and the company replaced them within the warranty period given the product reviews i thought this would be a bit more robust it failed in 10 days i do not understand how people advertise for these products when it failed after using it 4 - 5 times,76,196
5337,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,almost good started working well past a week the red light did not worked then past 3 months the gogroove stoped working,21,197

5339,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,I am a bit of a headphone audiophile i do a lot of home recording none of the bluetooth headsets I have tried under 100 are great bluetooth limits audio quality significantly but for the price these are every bit as good as the 100 headphones i like the controls behind the ear they fit me fine not uncomfortable as some reviews suggested I am really hoping these hold up we will see how they do with continued exposure to workout conditions and sweat,80,199
5340,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,this worked great for two weeks then petered out i run a lot and sweat a lot it seems like this unit does not like sweat the left earbud went out after a 14 mile run then it stopped turning on seems like all the moisture and sweat from a long run fizzled the unit out shame i liked the ease of the unit but it is got ta be water moisture resistant for those long runs and sweaty workouts this would be a good choice for those who either do not perspire that much or like the wireless convenience for easy workouts or general use,103,200
5341,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,do not waste your time with these they really are bad to listen to never even took mine to the gym because they was not worth even considering,26,201
5342,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i had a s9 before this and i like this one better fits nicer and is more comfortable battery life is good and so is the sound quality for what i paid it is a steal,35,202
5343,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,good sound as long as i am pushing the earbuds into my ear canal and easily connects to my bluetooth devices the issue is they simply do not make a tight seal with the eardrum a lot of external environmental noise due to the loose fit and honestly they are a bit uncomfortable and have an awkward fit on the old noggin going to look for some bluetooth exercise headphones that cup around the ear rather than the earbud style maybe go for the old school look with the huge headphones and the 5 foot antennae that the joggers back in the late 70s early 80s sported,106,203
5344,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,they have great battery life i workout 5 days a week from two to four hours and never a problem they charge quickly and keep it they have great range and no problem with my iphone pairing sound is great,40,204
5345,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i made the mistake of trying to save a few bucks and went with this model i loved it i have run 3 five 5ks with it and my iphone4 with no trouble it died this week and will not turn on go with the lg bluetooth headset i sincerely doubt i will have any luck returning this or getting a replacment,62,205
5346,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i used this headset about 20 times over the course of two months and the battery charger seems to have melted the battery and it no longer works while the headset fits nicely and is easy to jog with it is not very good for using with the mic since it is just to far from your mouth it picks up a lot of background noise i did love it for working out but only as headphones regardless a product that burns up after such a short time is not worth any amount of money,95,206
5347,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,received on christmas day charging cable got lost and it is custom connector i have not been able to use can not find the link to contact them either,27,207
5348,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i was really looking forward to my first bluetooth headphones when i received these i could not get them to pair with any bluetooth devices i even took them to a verison store and they tried everything i returned them and will now try the lgs,46,208
5349,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,these headphones are better than expected so far i have used them on the treadmill with my ipad and iphone and have gotten great reception with both also used them downstairs with ipad and have had no issues with reception in the greatroom limited use with calls but they worked great overall very satisfied especially for the price,58,209
5350,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,like a number of reviewers report here i was happy with it but then it stopped charging or turning on not sure what has the issue after a little less than 3 months of use 2 - 3 times a week for running maybe it does not like the sweat but then i have short hair and so not much sweat should have gone in too bad,64,210
5351,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,these headphones sound great connect well with my smart phone and i-pad and have a long battery life they could be better on the comfort level but they stay on while I am working out,34,211
5352,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the good pairing was easy andworked either with my phone and tablet sound quality is good works 50 feet away from my phone the bad the fit is really bad during sport i had to readjust every few minutes that they do not pop out ok this would be acceptable and maybe due to my head shape but not acceptable is that the device stooped working after 6 month at the end a charge lasted about 30 minutes and i was not able to turn off the device i would not recommend this device,99,212
5353,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,oustanding sound clarity and noise reduction i can do everything i need to with just a click or two of a button combined with voice commands i never have to touch my phone a little bulky on the back of the neck and interferes with laying back without that minor problem i would give 5 stars i highly recommend this for anyone who wants a true hands-free device with outstanding sound quality,72,213
5354,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i bought this stereo bluetooth to use with my phone computer or hp touchpad it pairs easily with any of these sound is good they fit well over the ears and into ear but the neckpiece often hits my upper back and loosens the earpieces i do have a short neck so for other users it may be fine,59,214
5355,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,no problem to detect both my ipod nano 6th gen and my laptop win 7 i have no problem to wear it as it is not uncomfortable but i never have it on the ears more than 2 hours in a row the only thing that is bothering me is the fact the buds do not keep in my ears because of the sweat at the gym i tried the 3 sizes that come with the headset no real solution otherwise the sound is good and the commands on the headset are easy to use to skip a track or go backwards for instance i did not use it with a cell phone,112,215
5356,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i thought this product was the best thing going they arrived fast synced to my phone easy sounded good but at the 45 day mark they just stopped working tried sync to a different device no luck it is as if they will not charge or just will not turn on i should have just spent the extra 30 and got the motorola ones,62,216
5357,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,bought this to use for walking so that clothing would not get in the way it is pretty good works as advertised battery life is better than i thought it would be all the function buttons work great i noticed a couple of times the connection would drop out for a fraction of a second but the battery might have been starting to get low can not beat it for the price,70,217
5358,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,the product is excellent it has very good sound and is quite useful and easy to use thank you very much for being outstanding for monitoring the suitability of the product,31,218
5359,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,looks cheap once i took it out of the box plastic looks dull very small fitting i am a 130 lb female my head is not that big and it did not fit comfortable at all,35,219
5360,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,very disappointing the product does not work as it says i initially bought this to avoid the bulky look and sweaty ears 1 does not seem to be able to stay in-ear at all and i am not even sweating 2 when at the gym and that is when it is horrible it slides off constantly sweating those headphones do not like at all since they are immediately stop when i sweat i thought that is what they were built for 3 radio reception is a nightmare i am in the same room a bit further from the source and the room is not mansion it stops brutally and need to restart each time the device 4 battery life is very poor i had to purchase another from arctic sound audio the p311 they are are amazing and all the points stated above it has no flaws i sweat how i want it never stops i go up to 3 different rooms in the house it never stops no sliding what so ever i can jump dancing whole night they remain in place until the battery goes off gc audio last less than 2 hours p311 last more than 4 hours and i got them for less than 25 dollars at the time when gc audio i got for almost 50 dollars shame i wish i could have noticed these flaws before but it only started now i would gladly ask for my money back total crap,244,220
5361,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,my husband loved the earphones the sound quality is amazing the charge lasts for several days depending on use he uses them at the gym and says they are amazing so light weight you barely feel you are wearing them others do not notice you ate wearing them either highly recommended,50,221
5362,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,this is a great product it initially rested funny on my left ear but now it is fine the cutting out can get a little annoying by this i mean it loses a signal from the phone i have a theory this is worse in the rain and through certain fabrics otherwise i think it is great and i would definitely buy the product again i am editting my first review as i can not seem to get this to hold a charge anymore for the price i think it should last more than 6 months,92,222
5363,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,this headset was awesome to use while talking on the phone it is the first headset i have used that my hard-of-hearing mother did not have a problem hearing me through the music played great while i was sitting at my desk however i bought this mostly for listening to music while running the music cuts in and out all the time which was super irritating i returned it due to the many great reviews i am going to order another one on the off chance that i got a defective one,92,223
5364,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,very cheaptoo flimsy gives you hard time to press the buttons specially when play songs or put the volume up not compatible with htc amaze 4 g conclusion not recommended,35,224
5365,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the product consistently had trouble pairing with my iphone 4 the range on the headset was laughable and if anything was in the direct line the sound skipped like an old cd player the earphones were bent at a weird angle and never truly went into my ears properly i had to glue the rubber ends on as they constantly came off i would have returned this product but my pug decided it was a chew toy when i was at work to be honest I had rather forget i ever purchased thisthan have to deal with customer returns i wound up buying the lg-tone hbs-700 the range is better the pairing is perfect the headphones stay in a much better purchase,122,225
5366,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i really love my bluetooth headset it is excellent for use while playing racquetball or working out it maintained full range throughout the entire racquetball court while my motorola droid x was sitting in one corner i have not used it enough to comment on the battery life but no complaints so far i would definitely recommend this unit to anyone who dislikes wires,62,226
5367,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i purchased these headphones in june of 2011 and i use them almost everyday i use them for working out and i sweat a decent amount headphones still work great battery life has been lasting about 8 - 10 hours of play time i connect the headphones to my motorola droid x and my macbook pro both work great i definitely recommend this product especially for the low price,67,227
5368,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,purchased gogroove audioactive wireless hands headphones couple months ago did not want to leave feed back just yet because 30 days is to soon for anto go bad quality sound not bad but very upset that battery does not even last an hour I have been charging it over and over again and as soon as i use it battery dies very upset trying to reach seller to exchange but no one has gotten back to me had to buy another set of headphones,83,228
5369,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,similar to other reviews i feel that this product does the job the sound is good not excellent once i figured out how to wear it properly it stayed in my ears fine i also used it for telephone calls and the sound is great and the microphone works well as per my interlocutors,54,229
5370,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i purchased the go groove headsets for my daily workouts i was tired of yanking my iphone off the arc trainer they work great syncd easily to my iphone great battery life and sound amazing the only downside would be a short range reception i noticed if my phone is in my left pocket the headsets lose connection intermittently and only have an effective range of about 10 feet,69,230
5371,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i bought these for my iphone 4s to wear while running on my treadmill i figured i could keep the iphone off the treadmill and prevent it from being jarred I have had these headphones for about a month and i am really enjoying them they work perfectly are sweat resistant and i love not having a cord to deal with while running,62,231
5372,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,they sound great fits head comfortably arrived very quickly was bought before christmas and was given as a gift and they loved them,23,232
5373,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,not adjustable for larger head behind ear headphones are not useable while laying on your back sound quality was below average price too high for sound quality bluetooth connected easily to i phone 4s fast delivery gogroove audioactive wireless hands-free bluetooth sports stereo earbud headset for motorola samsung lg apple htc and more a2dp enabled smartphones,63,233
5374,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,product arrived and would not charge throught the usb computer connectionor the wall charger i was never able to power it on and therefor can not rate it is effectiveness i purchased it for use in training camp but ended up using some cheap old ones instead amazon accepted the return but did not allow the option to send a replacement mistakes happen and i would have been happy to give the product another try,73,234
5375,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,great for listening to downloaded music on your phone and a great bluetooth my husband loves it he recieved it as an anniversary gift has not had any problems since recieving it 2 weeks,32,235
5376,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i purchased this product over the motorola sd9 hd simply because of price i got what i paid for i was not able to ever get the device syncd to my iphone 4s i also tried my wifes iphone 4 i fully charged it although the instructions said it is ready to go after trying again that night i could not connect at all i packed it up and returned it the next day i then purchased the motorola sd9 hd and can not say enough good things about them 1 being they connected from attempt 1 and have connected upon power up instantly without effort,103,236
5377,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,the best price for bluetooth headphones by far but only had for a week before they would not charge and almost started a fire,24,237
5378,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i have been using these for two months and i love them the sound quality could be a little better but they are great for the price however the charger has stopped working i love the headphones but clearly the charger was not made well enough to hold up to using them at least 4 days a week,58,238
5379,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,the product was exactly what i ordered but apparently not what my husband wanted gift i need to return it but i do not have the return information that one tiny packing slip from my huge amazon order has been misplaced darn any help from amazon re this return,48,239
5380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,they are not perfect but they were only 36 i guess my head is a little big so i needed to use a hair dryer to warm up the plastic and widen them out so they would be more com fortable and not pop off while moving around I am useing it with 3rd gen ipod touch someone else mentioned in their review that the sound can cut in and out this is true but mainly seems to be related to the position of the ipod when i have it in my pocket and i bend over putting my ipod between my leg and stomach for example the signal seemsto get blocked or at east temporally interupted it also happens but less often in a back pocket it can also in a breast pocket if you cross your arms over you chest to tight again these seem to be quick signal interuptions and if you aware of the movements you can minimize them if I am working in a room and just leave it on a shelf it works just fine with almost no interuption in fact I had say you can walk as much as 30 ft from the ipod without losing signal I have found if I am doing something that really requires me to move around my arm band holder works great,218,240
5381,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,initially i was skeptical about buying this headset due to the price but after reading the reviews i thought what the heck i could buy three of these for what i paid for my motorola ht-820s boy i was extremely surprised when i received these both with promptness of the delivery and the quality of the product the earpieces fit snugly in the ear allowing this set to provide sound quality on par with my ht-820s they are lightweight and do not bounce around unlike the heavier 820 and they do not put so much pressure on my ears like the 820 does highly recommend this set for price and quality,112,241
5382,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,bluetooth on this product is very very bad everytime i would put my phone in the pocket of my jacket i would loose reception returned,26,242
5383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,everything seemed perfect it is comfortable it paired my mobile just fine but it has a very irritating noise on bright sounds I am very dissatisfied,25,243
5384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,as the title above proclaims this is the very first time i am writing a review on amazon even although i am an ardent fan of amazon the headphones two were meant to be christmas gifts for my 19 year old son and adult daughter they are both very athletic and i thought they could use it when working out however they both preferred another brand that has a built in mp3 player and does not need a phone / ipod to bluetooth connect with and play music so i gifted 1 headset to my nephew who stays glued to the cell phone and i kept the other one for myself i took mine for my 3 hour uphill hike yesterday and listened to music the entire time here is my review very easy to pair with my android phone i did not have to charge it before use it came charged music quality is good i am not very discriminating when it comes to listening to music so i can not comment on the audio quality for the price i paid and the purpose it will serve i am very satisfied good quality of voice calls better than the hands free calling from my acura this hike usually takes me 35 hours with the headphones yesterday i did it in 3 hours not sure if it was because of the headphones or the gr8 massage i got before the hike i will update this post in a few months once i have experienced the battery life and the durability of the product,266,244
5385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,this device is absolutely great for listening to your music with very good sound quality incoming however it does not pickup your voice very well when speaking to callers outgoing i just got so tired of people asking me to repeat myself in addition to that it frequently times out or goes to sleep power off if not used for 20 minutes or more so when a call comes thru i have to try to find the power button to turn it back on by the way the power button is not easy to press down to power up the device conclusion if you are only looking for a device to play your music via bluetooth while working out or walking about this is an excellent choice if you are looking to also use it for talk time please do so with caution and expect to repeat yourself often,146,245
5386,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i purchased this after destroying numerous corded headsets while running the unit is solid and it worked very well for me i was able to pair it very easily to my iphone 4 i have a smaller head and this fit very well and it has never worked loose while running my only complaint regarding this device is the on / off button can be finicky it is a little difficult to get it to activate sometimes but it may be user error I had buy this again no doubt,86,246
5387,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,received the phones as a christmas gift followed the clear instructions for initial charging and for pairing with my iphone it was a snap i will be using them mainly for music during outdoor runs sound seemed fine and more importantly it seems like they will stay put as i run i have tried three different styles of wired earbuds and they have all fallen out very annoying the new bluetooth set up should solve the problem,77,247
5388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,my main reason for getting the gogroove headphones was to be able to workout and listen to music without snagging the headphone cable distance from phone to headset is never greater than a couple of feet my samsung infuse stays in my shorts pocket i found that power lines can interfere with music playback the first day i used the headsets i tossed them to the side after about 20 minutes of horrific start / stop playback i initially wrote a scathing review then stopped to consider the environment and realized my workout was right underneath a hefty powerline so i waited until i gave them another go today i tried them again at a different location playback was hugely improved but still subject to stop / start as i neared powerlines pros cheap price no wires cons earpieces need to be constantly pushed back into place seems to be tension on the unit that naturally causes that a headband might help playback is not perfect expect to have music interrupted a few times per song charging cable is non-standard headset feels odd maybe it is the shape of my head / ears but i really do prefer the feel of my old sport headphones better overall impression from a music playback perspective is meh I shall use them until they break but will not run out to replace them update on 06/01/2012 it died lasted 6 months,234,248
5389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,this headset although not the most comfortable on the ears does what it is intended to doi bought it specifically for listen to music while laying downi work nights and the mrsworks during the dayi like that i can lay in bed and not disturb her and if i fall asleep I am not strangled by my ear buds cordalso if i roll over i will not fling my ipod off the night standthe sound is good ear buds tend to be tight and bother my ears after a while but i just bought this two weeks ago maybe they just need some getting used tooother than that i can walk around the house on the weekends and not force my kids to listen to my music all day the charge lasts pretty long too I have only recharged it once in the two weeks I have owned themdo not expect too much from these and you will not be disappointedtheir not bose quality and their not going to blow out your eardrums if you crank them to 11most importantly they paired easily to my iphone 4ipad and my archos 5 i also purchased a bluetooth adapter made by sony that goes on the bottom of my ipod and it paired with that as well the range is decent about 25 - 30 feet i would definitely recommend these to a friend,222,249
5390,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,this handfree nice and good but her voice some low but i like this so much and easy for used,20,250
5391,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i am truly impressed with these bluetooth headphones i read many reviews of other brands and the thing that turned me away from the others was the complaints about sweat getting inside and shorting out the headphones well i read reviews about the gogroove head phones and did not find any complaints about this issue so i decided to buy them after using these headphones 5 days a week for the past 2 months i can confidently say that there are no issues with sweat getting inside this headset i run 4 days a week and lift weights 3 days a week with each session lasting from 45 min to 1so these have been exposed to a lot of sweat and they hold up well i do not have any issues with sweat getting inside nor does the sweat deteriorate the durability of the material it is made out of they are a high quality product also the bluetooth works very well i used them with my iphone 3gs and now with my iphone 4s and the headset connects perfectly with both phones i can answer phone calls change my songs and adjust the volume all from the headset with an investment of around 30 40 dollars i expected less from them i recommend these to anyone looking for a solution to the wired headphones that get snagged and pulled out of your ears while you work out at this price they are the best value out there,249,251
5392,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i took the less expensive route purchased these headphones sound is good works with playstation iphone and acer a500 well the writing has worn off the volume and search toggle on the headphones not made for hat sizes close to 7 1/2 i wear them and sleep in them anyway cheap art work but not cheap on sound great low cost option for cheapoz like me did see wet paint in any other comments,74,252
5393,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,these headphones were a fine solution with my old samsung galaxy 1 phone they fit fairly comfortably unless you are wearing a very high or thick collar had good reception relatively clear audio for phone calls and find audio for music while walking and running unfortunately they do not work at all with my new phone i recently replaced my old phone with the new samsung galaxy iis skyrocket phone and that phone will not recognize this headset I have attempted to pair them several times and had no luck my new phone does pair with other bluetooth devices including my jawbone ear piece so I am fairly sure that the problem does not originate with the phone it is unfortunate that i will no longer be able to get any use out of this headset i give it 3 stars because it is a fine headset when used with a compatible device it is unfortunate that it is not designed to pair with newer models,164,253
5394,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,everything seems to be working for me music all controls work but for the phone i only get the redial by pressing twice the power button and hang up with the one press then i have tried many times and different ways to do voice dialing by pressing for about 2 seconds sometimes longer to see if it is activated and nothing happens i can not access voice through this sometimes when i leave it pressed for too long trying to see if the problem is having to have it pressed longer but no it just shuts off please any help would be appreciated i have tried contacting them but no answer and they only have email support so thanks,119,254
5395,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i bought this for use with tv in bed sound is fine it is not particularly comfortable as it is one size fits all so a bit large for my head however the most irritating thing is that the battery life is basically good for one session i compulsively turn it off when not using it but that does not seem to prolong the battery,63,255
5396,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i fell in love with this handsfree headset but after using it for about 4 months the piece that goes around your ear split completely apart i would love to receive a replacement for thisbut do not know how to contact the seller to the seller if u do read this please contact me at glendora37 aolcom,57,256

5400,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,bought these to use with my droid x my goal was to leave my phone on my shop shelf and still be able to listen to music and audio books i could not get 8 feet from my phone without loosing the connection this was line of sight without any obstructions bluetooth range should be around 30 feet I had settle for 20 also could not use the backwards function forward seemed to work alright also the power on button was a pain to use it is incorporated into the volume up / down toggle switch except you push straight down on the button maybe my hands are just too big but i found it difficult to work with these tiny switches it was a great price and the sound was alright audiobook did not listen to music if you walk around with your phone on your belt these might work for you i wear a large tool belt and did not want to scratch up my phone while I am working that is why i wanted to listen to it remotely,172,260
5401,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,so far works like a charm with my droid holds a good charge and sound is very good only negatives a little tight on a wider head and earpieces not as adjustable as they could be so move around some all in all although still a plus / plus,46,261
5402,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i need help on how to set it with an iphone 4 or an itouch 3 I am having trouble on how to set it up can someone teach mebybecause i m really wanting to use it but can not,41,262
5403,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,the delivery was quick i enjoyed the clearness of the sound and the no hassle of wires dangling in your way while walking or excercising it was easy to paired to any device that was bluetooth enable the volume control was easy to control but the fast forward and backward was kind of off sync when i touch the control to forward the next song it will take a couple of seconds before it would forward and sometimes make think i did not do it correctly and forward it again it would forward too much with the slow snyc second the only bad part was trying to fit it comfortablely especially if i am wearing glasses it is so hard to make it comfortable but once you find the right spot it is sometimes hard to find it again overall this is worth getting,144,263
5404,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i was able to use these once for 25 minutes listening to audible before the battery died after that the battery would like charge hopefully just a defective device,29,264
5405,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,connect easily to my phone none of the function work with lg esteem in 2 day all the writing on the headset was erase so unless you know where the power button and other control was you are lostalthought none of the features work anyway can not make a call wirelessly can not fast forward or backward i have a 10 bluetooth that do more work for listening to music do not sweat it stop working in a week,76,265
5406,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,this headset is perfect and works perfect as described i have a htc mytouch 4 g android phone and with the a2dp i can listen to music directly from the phone and in stereo no other bluetooth I have tried before does that the controls work well and the sound quality is good,51,266
5407,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,tried all kinds of earbuds grew tired of wires decided to give these a try and i have not been disappointed great sound sturdy product very comfortable and goes with me to every workout i would buy these again in a heartbeat,42,267
5408,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,this pair did not stay in my ears well during my exercise i kept having to adjust it and it was annoying the sound is good if you are you manage to keep them in your ear it was mostly a fitting problem for me so it may work well for others,53,268
5409,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,after trying several headsets this one is a keeper i am an avid book reader and the gogroove is attached to me 7 days a week the sound is very good and the battery life is is a lot better than my previous headsets i wear glasses and have no problem using it the price was right too would highly recommend this headset also very easy to set up amazons 2 day shipping is a plus,76,269
5410,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i bought 2 headset one for myself and the other one for a friend he loves them but me i do not find them confortable i am short and the headset where hitting the back of my head and the ear plug were coming out of my ears but my friend loves them,52,270
5411,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,the gogroove audioactive wireless headset easy to pair up with the media device good and acceptable quality sound for the price,21,271
5412,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i got these thinking they were suited for active use as suggested by the name of the product i must say it has not lived up to it is name first of all while you are supplied with different ear bud adapters to fit into your ear it still does not conform to the shape of your head so it still is too wide for my head the track buttons for back and forward are labeled incorrectly lastly they have crapped out on me after 4 months of marathon training this is the worst part especially since there was a year warranty i do not recommend buying stay away,107,272
5413,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,synced with all of my devices without a problem as mentioned in the other reviews the power cord is odd but the seller sent me two if you buy this make sure and keep the power cord in a place where you will not loose it the connection is odd on the device end however the other end is usb so you do not have to buy a special separate charger i bought it for use at the gym wired audio had become a problem did not want to be one of those people who watch their expensive device drop onto the treadmill and fling off onto the floor,106,273
5414,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i bought the headset and was thrilled to replace my skull candy wired headset but after only a few uses the headset died and now totally useless i did not mishandle it get it wet or do anything that would warrant it to not work so soon i probably only got to use it about 5 times they really need to fix the short life in the battery this is ridiculous,70,274
5415,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i was a little worried when i bought this because of the price but have been surprised about how well it works I have read some of the negative reviews and honestly have not run into any problems it connected to my phone htc evo 4 g it fits my head and ears fine and it is plenty loud enough for me anyway it is been so far so good for me,67,275
5416,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,as others have said the sound quality on this headset is not perfect but oh my has this been the perfect product for me i use these while running and to be wire-free has been amazing i use an armband to hold my phone and have never had a problem with the sound cutting out i love that i can skip songs adjust the volume and even answer calls without having to deal with taking my phone out of the armband the controls on this headset rock the headset stays intact and has never moved while running i love love love this thing,103,276
5417,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i purchased these headphones after doing a considerable amount of review with my main purpose being to use them while running the unit came already charged and with only minimal work paired with my motorola droid since i have used it at home outdoors and at the gym the sound quality is decent and maintaining bluetooth connection has not been a problem up to around 20 feet i sweat alot and had concerns given negative reviews I have read about the motorola models so far I have not had any difficulties in this regard either the unit fit reasonably comfortably on my head with the medium buds it comes with 3 sizes and did not move while running overall I am quite pleased with these headphones,122,277
5418,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,so from when i first opened them up and charged them i was already not so happy the wrap around bar is hard thought it was a soft wire which as i expected and have had problems with motorolas bluetooth sport headphones they bounce when running or moving a lot and if you are laying on a weight bench or trying to stretch you should just take them off because they will continue to fall away from your ears sound was good battery life i could not tell you because they would no longer charge after using them twice overall not worth the hassle if you want good bluetooth stereo headphones look elsewhere mine are in a box on their way back to the seller,123,278
5419,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,excelente producto funciona super bien con mi blacberry hasta trae mic para poder contestar las llamadas genial is a very good headphone,22,279
5420,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i got this headset for my birthday and love them no more worrying about wires getting in the way while I am running and exercising kudos to my husband and boys for thinking about me,34,280
5421,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,the product pairs easily with all of my devices and the sound quality is great it is comfortable to wear even with glasses the sound quality is great and the controls on the device are easy to use the range is great i have paired it with my tv across the room for gaming and there is no loss of connectivity or sound quality at a distance of 15 feet my son wants one now and will most likely buy another,81,281
5422,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i ordered a pair of these towards the end of august and have used them about 3 - 4 times a week during my 35 mile runs the battery life was good the comfort was good and it was working well for me this week they decided to stop working for me by the way of not turning on,57,282
5423,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,overall good build quality for the price I have never used bluetooth earbuds before but these are amazing for running i keep my phone in my pocket and do not have to worry about the wires wrapping around my arms or getting in the way the comfort is not too bad and neither is the sound quality it took me a little bit to get a comfortable fit but once i get them on they feel great only thing i wish was they were adjustable but i am very pleased overall,88,283
5424,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i got these headphone thinking that i might be able to get rid of the cable while at the gym listening to music well the device is very uncomfortable to wear and it has no adjustment on the head band therefore unless you have a big head you will have this awkward looking wing on the back of your head the device itself is made from cheap plastic and feels flimsy the sound quality is atrocious might as well just stick with the corded headphones and get good quality my 299 cheapo headphones produce a better sound quality than these wireless ones,101,284
5425,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,i like this device the only part i do not like is how bulky the part that goes behind the ears is while it does not make my ears stick out too much they do stick out more when i put them on and i hate that i get self-conscious because of it other than the bulkiness they are really convenient to have i love that there has no wires attached in fact i almost forget my iphone on the machines at the gym because of it so be careful with that gym members the best part about these bluetooth headphones is that i can get calls and talk with them on with no problems another thing although is that when i workout with them the do slip out my ears a little because of the sweat i have found myself pushing them back in they will not fall off although at least not on an elliptical if you do not mind ur ears just sticking out a little then i would say these are pretty good headphones for the price,176,285
5426,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i have had this product for a week now and really like it i use it on my p90x resistance days and while running the sound quality is pretty good and they are pretty comfortable to wear once you get used to having them on the loop over the ear could be a little more flexible but they do not hurt i just have to adjust them and work them around my ears a bit when putting them on they do not fall off and do stay in place no matter what activity i am doing they do slip out of the ear but i think that is because i need to try a different size ear piece on them i am currently using this product with my htc droid incredible i have used the htc and android music player to listen to music and have used c25k and runkeeper running programs i have no problem listen to music and hearing audio cues from both of the running programs,167,286
5427,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,it is a good product and also delivered on time as i expected i am free to talk on phone even while i am cooking or doing other work and phone can be connected to power in one corner of my room to get charged,44,287
5428,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,maybe i have deformed ears but these things do not stay in my ear canals I am constantly adjusting and smashing them back into my ear canals I have tried all the different sized ear buds that came with the headset but nothing seems to work they are okay for just walking around the house but once the jostling / sweating starts they fall right out during a run i had to just take them off because they were that distracting sound quality is not bad when they are smushed all the way into the ear canal which is not for long might have to take them back due to the fact i bought them for exercising range is not as nice as my other headset but not bad enough to cover a few rooms,129,288
5429,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,this product is by far the greatest thing ever invented do not you hate when your listining to your ipod or watching a movie on your laptop and your using traditional wired hedphones then you have to get up or somthing and the wire gets ripped out which somtimes damages the hedphones with these bluetooth headphones you never have to worry about that ever again,63,289
5430,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i bought gogroove audioactive to use primarily when working out and when working around the house where when using traditional headsets the wire always get caught on something i have read reviews about other bluetooth headsets that get damaged with sweat but thus far no issues the bass could be much better the sound is a bit tinny but for the price and value in not having a wire hanging down while i work out you can not beat this headset the headset initially felt a bit tight but now i do not even notice that they are on i could give it a 4 star because of the overall sound quality but will give it 5 stars because it works as advertised and I am thrilled about the comfort and not having wires september 13th update thus far i love the headset no issues whatsoever awesome to be able to work out with out those pesky wires getting in the way likewise when working around the yard and more losing the wires frees the soul the control buttons feel a bit flimsy but awesome value for the price highly recommended,188,290
5431,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,I am really pleased with the headset i use it while biking sound is good it stays in place and does not interfere with my helmet i like the ability to skip or repeat a song my only problem is pressing the button to receive a call while in motion,49,291
5432,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,works great with my droid x it makes a big difference when you are running machinery all day to be able to have music with no antenna and no wires i bought it soley for the music playing abilities but it also works great with phone calls people can hear me very clearly,53,292
5433,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i purchased these headphones to use while exercising and to prevent any further episodes where my arm catches my headphone cable and makes my ipod go flying across the gym while running they arrived quickly and included an appropriate ac wall wart and usb charging cable thissyncd quickly and played back well with my iphone 3gs ipod touch and my friends iphone 3 g the sound quality is decent but is helped out a little bit by the effective noise sealing of the earphones themselves the device is much lighter than i expected it to be and the weight is not something i notice at all during use the design is not uncomfortable to me but i would not describe it as comfortable either behind the neck headbands tend to have issues when performing exercises while laying on your back the whole unit is very stiff to put on and take off and I am hoping it loosens up a bit with use bluetooth range is more than i need i sat my ipod down and walked about 18 feet away while listening to music with no issues for the gym or running it is more than adequate control interface is simple one volume power volume rocker and another for rw pause ff pressing the center position of each rocker switch is a challenge given their size and the fact that you might be running while trying to do it but it has not limited me in any way push power to turn the unit on hold it down to put it into sync mode select it on your device and it is ready to go i have not hit the end of battery life while using yet all in all a very decent product for a very low price,298,293
5434,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i bought these headphones several months ago and finally synched it up so this review is not very comprehensive it was easy to connect sound quality was good and it is comfortable have not taken them for a run yet or figured out how to call someone without picking up my phone even although the instructions say i can maybe it does not do that with droids overall i am pleased with my purchase,73,294
5435,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,I shall keep it brief pros good price overall easy to use works great for working out stays dry and no problems with sweat cons rocker-buttons are somewhat hard to push without pushing them down a third function although this does not usually because any issues I have noticed some occasional issues keeping a quality bt connection which I have never noticed with other headphones on this phone slightly uncomfortable for me i have a larger than average head but once they are on i hardly notice them through an hour plus workout i have not used them for a phone call yet so i can not review that portion but for my needs workout using phone as music player they have done everything i want,117,295
5436,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,everything is fine but it is really designed for a specific shape and sized head the head phone constantly wants to pop out and the plastic is adjustable it is a hard plastic that stays a specific shape for a specific head,41,296
5437,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,should you find yourself looking for a bluetooth headset that features quality sound comfortability and longevity look elsewhere this unit is the pits and a joke i purchased the gogroove as a replacement for my samsung sbh170 headset because the sbh170 does not fit my head properly the gogroove did the sound was not what i was accustomed to but i figured it would serve the purpose of providing entertainment as i worked around my home and office after only twenty-nine days the unit died completely it was not dropped did not get wet and was never mishandled it just simply quit working what a waste of money and my time,108,297
5438,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the package included a mini usb charger but the headset charging port was another type not mini usb so this product review is short when the product is received in what appears to be the original packaging but the charger port does not have the same adapter as the charger then I have said all i can say about the product buyer beware is about all that comes to my mind when writing this review,74,298
5439,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,i can not say anything about the sound quality of the product because i never got to use it the usb cable used to charge it does not fit in the device very strange must have been packaged with the wrong charger so bummed,42,299
5440,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i was looking for something to help make the mundane chore of cutting grass a more enjoyable task the headset is lightweight and comes with an assortment of ear-bud size adapters it works well with my htc incredible i have used it for 6 hrs straight and it was still playing strong i use it to play pandora and music downloaded to my phone with no problem except for momentary breaks in the signal from time to time it pairs to my phone quickly and recharges in a short amount of time after reading the short simple instructions for the device it was basically ready to use right out the package no wires good sound lightweight long time battery life easy to use at a great price makes this device a winner for me for those that have high and unrealistic expectations for bluetooth devices probably should go ahead and pay a lot more for a headset however it has been my experience that bigger prices may not translate into a better product i definitely recommend this product those on the go activities,183,300
5441,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,the headset is light easy to charge easy to use I have had it for a few weeks now and i use it every day you can leave your phone charging and walk around the room or outside the room the signal goes about ten feet and still get great clear sound i recommend it to everyone works with pandora allows you to skip to the next song,68,301
5442,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,good sound quality as long as you are not an audiophile easy to pair with an iphone stays in place while running and has been sweat-proof so far definitely worth the money,31,302
5443,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,device works good and seems to be comfortable but the cable that they send to charge does not fit into headphones i think i will have to send these back unless i can figure out how to charge the thing soon,41,303
5444,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,was not overly confident when i purchased this product but i am quite impressed at this point they are great for air and auto travel easy to navigate switches to take call and then back to droid mp3 operates simply with blue tooth pairing this is a quality product with great features easy to use and well worth the price,59,304
5445,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,unable to receive any sound from left ear bud while on phone when listening to music minimal sound from left ear no volume control for left ear independently caller report a lot of back ground noise when on phone do not receive these complaints with wired dual ear piece,49,305
5446,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,the headphones worked well for 4 months they fit well sounded ok was a little testy when it came to pairing up bluetooth however all these things came to an end after 4mo of light use it seems as although it no longer wants to recharge so not sure what kind of batteries are in it but I am guessing it is not lithium ion,64,306
5447,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,i like that i can where it with my hat it blocks out external sound just the right amount i use it at work where there is a lot of dust and it seems to have no problem with dust or being dropped the one thing i do not like is the buttons the buttons are hard to use,58,307
5448,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,shipping 1was received quickly even to an apo address packaging 1 product was packed to ensure it arrived safe and complete headset 1 audio quality has some echoing but it is bearable 2 the headset is not noise cancelling but it does well when the volume is up 3 easy instruction on functions and pairing 4 mic works well on skype it cuts in and out every once in a while but great for the price overall great product for the price i would recommend it,88,308
5449,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,the headphones fit ok not bad but not good eaither i am a big guy and i really hate one size fits all but i figure your avarage sized man or woman it would fit great the sound quality is good if you have the earbuds shoved all the way up nyour ear canal not so hot otherwise i could always hear the caller on the phone just fine but if there was any noise at all in the background they always said they could not hear me very well,89,309
5450,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i wanted a bluetooth headset to listen to podcasts and streaming radio from my iphone while working out at the gym or running but the price of models from sony motorola and the like were just a bit more than i wanted to pay a friend had a pair of these and recommended them I have used the headset for about a month and really like it it is light fits well has great battery life and the sound quality is pretty high it paired easily with my phone highly recommended,90,310
5451,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,after ruining the fourth pair of wired headphones in the past six months i decided to finally spend the extra money and get a pair of bluetooth headphones my ears are too small for earbuds and my main reasoning for these headphones was to use at the gym so over the ear headphones were out of the question due to how sweaty they get so the design of these headphones really fit the bill i have been very happy with the purchase and it is a shame that it seems this product is no longer available as i suggested them to some friends and they told me they were sold out hopefully this great product will be restocked because at the asking price they are well worth the money,129,311
5452,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,the product works perfectly and so far it has held true to it is up to 7 hours on one charge it looks great and fits great thanks to the different sized earpieces that are included i use it for music at the gym and a headset for the ps3 so far i have not had any problems with sweat or smell and the only problem that I have discovered is that it sits high off the neck so when you sit / lie back on a workout machine it gets pinched when this happens it stays on but the earpieces tend to pop out a bit causing a drop in bass and sound quality the same thing happens if it is rotated to sit lower on the neck not a debilitating problem because it is still a great product and the unit can easily be adjusted back once you stand up I am not an audiophile so the sound quality is sufficient for my needs but others may be left wanting tip I have been able to use it with an iphone 2 g even although it does not have a2dp by dialing 307 to activate a call pair the headset dial the number answer the call on the headset answer the call on the phone select the headset as the audio source then ipod away,216,312
5453,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,the gogroove was almost what i was looking for for the price the audio was great the controls were easy to find and remember where to locate without making mistakes unfortunetly the fast forward and rewind did not work with my iphone 3gs that was not the biggest issue i had with this it was the fit into the ear that just did not work for me the loop over the ear part was flexible but it never stayed in the ear and kept popping out either one ear or the other i work in a very noisy environment and these were great noise blockers almost like earplugs it just bothered me that i had to keep pushing them back in if you do not need earplugs to block out the noise then these are great for just about everything else,138,313
5454,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,i do like this bluetooth headset very much my only complaint is it seems to untether from my house phone and my cell phone quite frequently not sure why yet still a very good product for the money very happy with it planning to get at least 2 more for my sons so they will leave mine alone,59,314
5455,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,i use an iphone4 and ipad tried this on both so my comments relate only to my personal experience with this product on these devices the product is great except 1 if you move the audio starts skipping as long as you just sit there on the couch you will get reasonable connectivity 90 but if you plan to go walking go to the gym get up to grab a soda and more then expect to miss every 3rd or 4th word of a song the more you move the worse it gets i bought this for use at the gym but simply can not use it there just does not work right 2 the phone connection is impractical although set up is easy and you can hear a caller great this is outstanding the caller can not hear you at all they lose about half of what you say so you can listen to voice mail with the thing but can not make or receive calls with any kind of effectiveness theis great and the technology exists to make this device actually do everything it claims but this seems more like a proto-type or beta-test kind of device and should not be on the consumer market my recommendation if you have an iphone do not buy this device other devices i can not speak to their integration but for apple products this is a nogo,238,315
5456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,jus get em great for the gym and i use em in my office i use with iphone 4,20,316
5457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,these are great headphones sometimes behind-the-head headphones can be irritating because they get knocked out of place if you lie down say on a workout bench but these stayed in place pretty well i experienced no problems with connectivity the sound quality was impressive for the price,47,317
5458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,if you are a runner and have been bothered by that headset cord dangling and swinging this is an easy answer i am a new runner and i run with my samsung epic 4 g i use runkeeper pro app to track my progress combine all that with this bt stereo headset i am finally cord-free sound 6/10 it is not the best but then again i was not expecting hifi on cordless headset definitely not for audiophiles having said that it is not that bad for the rest of us it is quite usable for phone conversations as well microphone picks up sounds quite well i am told comfort 8/10 out of the box it is pretty stiff if you wear glasses it is a bit uncomfortable but that is given with any behind the ear device once you break it in a bit you do not notice it too much as for running it stays in place and does not bounce bluetooth performance is somewhat lacking in strength in signal I am not sure what class bluetooth device this is but I had be surprised if it is rated at class 2 it is really limted to perhaps 3 - 4 feet sometimes when I am running the sound drops for a split second here and there also when connected to my desktop computer in front of my treadmill at about 4 feet out i experience 1 - 2 second delay in audio i purchased this for my runs and it serves that purpose very well and also at this price range you really can not go wrong,252,318
5459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,it was easy to pair too bad they did not use a standard usb connection on the headphones carrying another cord sucks sound is ok lacks base it might be because they are new but they squeeze the area behind my ears pretty tightly hopefully they will relax over time the wheel used to skip forward and back is backwards the way you would expect to push the wheel for forward same direction as play is actually the revers function,79,319
5460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,for 30 i thought why not try it you could not find a better deal for these type of headphones opened the box read the instructions and paired the headphones with my iphone 4 flawlessly just make sure you read the instructions on how to pair the device because the lights have to blink red and blue i tried them out and works great no cutting out and the controls are very easy to use already got used to them after day 1 you can even use voice dial on the iphone with the headphones and you can talk through the headset really well to makes calls or answer them with your iphone they are not the most comfortable but they are not uncomfortable the sound is not of superior quality but they are not bad the in-ear design is nice for cancelling some noise and seems to have a good water-resistant material and structure definitily going to be awesome to work out or do anything without the wire getting in the way buy these,172,320
5461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,greatbut the belt snap is already starting to pull and it is too low down not kidding greatbut they did not design it well,28,0
5462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,i should have paid attention to the other reviews the clip is placed too low the only thing in the case was my phone had not added anything else at that point and the case falls forward when attached to my pocket thus hitting everything you walk past i can see why other reviews stated the clip gets yanked off the zippers are plastic i do not see them lasting very long the interior of the zippered area is very soft and i do not think it would scratch anything but if you can not use it that really does not matter the interior of the velcro area is not so soft i would not put anything sensitive in there if you want to just carry this case it would be an okay case for a while but remember those zipper fobs are rubber coated plastic they will snap off all in all i had high hopes for this case I have been looking for a vertical case that could hold a few identification cards for my samsung reality looks like the search is still on,179,1
5463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,1.0,negative,for 1649 i thought it would be well made and of good quality however after two weeks the silver part on the back broke off i would not recommend this product it was for my husband and he was extremely unhappy with it my husband is disabled and rarely leaves the house so obviously he did not get much use from it before it broke offl,67,2
5464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,i bought this to carry my iphone and some accessories it is a nice looking case and roomy enough however does not wear well on your belt or pant as it is not secure and is bulky the belt clip is not positioned high enough and when worn on your pant / belt it would fall forward from the weight of the items i then attached the lanyard / carabiner and would wear it around my waist and then clip to pant / belt and that helped to secure and a couple of days later the carabiner loop stitching became undone and i stopped using theit was not comfortable for me this case would be okay if you were to carry it in a bag but since i prefer to wear on my pant / belt it did not work out for me,133,3
5465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,this case is just what i need for my new mp3 player it holds the player and peripherals looks good and even has a place for a stylus should i decide to buy one however i must comment on the quality of this merchandise less than 5 minutes after removing it from the box one of the zipper hasps plastic but painted silver to look like metal snapped off hopefully some crazy glue will remedy this situation but this is why this gets 2 stars instead of 4,88,4
5466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,i really liked theof this case small with multiple pockets for phone headphones cables and more unfortunately while theis definitely right the execution is inadequate in several ways first the clip is poorly mounted and located as described elsewhere it is mounted with two small rivets so I am anticipating tear-out before too long but the big one for me is that the clip is mounted too low on the back of the unit as a result when the case is clipped on to anything like a belt or pocket it tends to sag off to one side instead of hanging straight the clip should be mounted toward the top-most part of the back with at least four rivets securing the clip pad to the case the carabiner loop already coming unstitched on one side literally after one days worth of use also the loop is just large enough to accommodate a small carabiner a little more slack would have allowed use of a full-size carabiner or other metal loop fitting snap or d-loopslastly the fabric loop should have been overlapped and extended the full length of the clip pad to ensure it stayed secured the carabiner not a big fan of the little key-ring aluminum carabiners i much prefer steel carried one for years on my keychain other the nylon fabric used in construction is not sufficiently overlapped and double-stitched to ensure a long service life overall i was hoping for a heavyweight piece of long-lasting work gear instead we have a lightweight piece of danger boy fluff suited to half-hour urban jaunts to starbucks this case is not something in which I had place much trust for protecting a 300 phone too bad since the ideas behind the case are excellent not recommended,297,5
5467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,absolutely wonderfulsturdy and exceptionally well designed this is an outstanding and well-pricedmy brand new droid is very safe in thismailed quickly and safely to me what can i say except wonderful as amazon always is amazon is always number one as far as i am concerned thank you gayle,55,6
5468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,1.0,negative,i loved this case because it fit my tmobile g2 plus my headphones and extra battery unfortunately the rivet that attaches the belt clip to the case came off i do not understand why the rivets head was made so small that eventually the leather piece it is attached to wears out and gives bad design,56,7
5469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,this case is exactly what i wanted the right size right number of pockets and the manufacturer even included a loop for a caribiner or bungee which i always use in fact i like it so much i bought two more as spares however it has one critical flaw why i can not give it 5 stars the belt clip is secured through a sewn-on leather pad with two 3/16 head rivets the heads are not big enough to hold well in the leather i got out of the car this evening the case caught on the seatbelt and pop that is why i always add a bungee i can repair this many people can not ill be contacting the manufacturer to tell them what happened so an excellent case overall but if you plan to wear it on your belt buyer beware,140,8
5470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,this product does not fit an iphone 5 in an otterbox this is my fault not the product or manufacturers fault i will probably use it at the beach or on vacation to carry money / identification,36,9
5471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,what can one say after all swiss leatherware is a quality driven company imho this is one of two purchases i made for my iphone 5s this one is for the more rugged days the other for dress up nights and more i love the fact that this has a small pouch which normally holds the charging cable but at times i have used it for coupons meds cash and more it also has a stylus holder which comes in handy i would certainly buy this case again since it has exceeded all my expectations,93,10
5472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,the case is functional but the pen holder pouch on the left side is one of the important reasons i chose this one the pen holder tore on the first one i owned in 60 days thought that one may have been defective so i ordered a second one a month and a half and the pen holder is starting to show wear if it tears i will not order a third,72,11
5473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,it is perfect and nice small practical soft and really like the photos and not very expensive i like it,20,12
5474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,i ordered this in hopes of having a compact way to carry my phone and extra battery as i read the description i compared the dimensions to my phone the case really is bigger than the dimensions indicated i am still using it to store accessories in my backpack but would never wear this on my belt,57,13
5475,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,reasonably priced and comes with carabiner clip to hook onto other bags belts and loops easy access to all pockets not 5 stars because it is a little smaller than i thought,32,14
5476,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,it took me several tries to find the correct size of pouch to replace the one that my husband uses on his belt this was a quality product but not the right size for us,35,15
5477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,very nice quality and design unfortunately my samsung galaxy s4 active did not fit i gave it to my niece and she seemed to like it,24,16
5478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,perhaps i stuffed it too much it is a great little tool although I am still using it even with the ripped it ripped at the edges of the zipper it is a shame because i really like,35,17
5479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,holds the camera and all accessories i need good quality construction would reccomend it to a friend or even someone i do not know,23,18
5480,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,provides the protection needed for a cell phone or small digital camera the extra pockets are nice too holds onto your belt or use the rectangular grommet provided to hang from anywhere a very nicely padded carry with enough protection for the small electronics we can not live without,48,19
5481,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,i purchased thisfor my iphone 5 and ended up using it as a camera case it is sturdy and good for that purpose but too bulky for my phone lots of compartments for extra things but the cord could stand being a little longer if you want to make it shorter that was not a problem as it has an adjustable toggle,63,20
5482,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,i like this case as it can carry things along with the phone i am able to carry a cleaning cloth and stylus and still have room for more like an identification or money in a pinch it is also stylish and goes with any outfit,46,21
5483,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,this is a very well madethe stitching zippers and other hardware are first class it should last many years the opening is not as large as it looks in the picture there are a number of small pockets inside the case but the limited width makes them less useful there is an outside pocket with limited additional space but providing great drop protection it has a very nice belt clip on the back providing additional drop protection this case would be good for an iphone-ipod-touch sized device or a thin pocket camera,94,22
5484,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,liked this pouch spacious strong quality but still very compact can also carrymed card and other items very easily,20,23
5485,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,this is a nice case my intended use was for an edc the storage compartments are great the problem i had with it is the clip is quite bulky no doubt made for a belt i just wanted to clip onto shorts and the back panel where this attaches to is to flexible this means the case effectively protrudes flops around further from the waist around 25 mm more than it needs to with an actual phone inside my guess is this would be a much firmer set up and keep things tight and more compact than with loose items such a nice case but i will need to rethink a use for this,113,24
5486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,it is perfect to carry everything you need this is my second one i used to other one so much it started to come apart,25,25
5487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,my camera fits nicely it would be much better if it were slightly larger to accomadate batteries the hook does not really work for me but,25,26
5488,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,it is great for traveling had to change the strap although easily done it was uncomfortable on the back of my neck plenty of room for lots of little things license mini camera credit / debit cards,33,27
5489,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,my only dislike is to many pockets inside when you have an extended life battery installed other than that is beautifully made of high quality material and is exactly as represented on line,33,28
5490,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,this product failed within the first two weeks and had to be returned product design was also not good for the use of the belt loop too much top heavy return and credit were easy,35,29
5491,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,after reading several other review i figured i could still use the clip and not use the belt clip i was wrong after receiving this i realized that the provided clip was about the only thing that would ever fit into it the other problem and many have said this is the belt clip the anchor point is far to low if it was designed to not have a swivel clip they could have anchored it higher making it work a lot better aside from those teo points the case held a lot for it is size i was able to put both my ipod with it is bamboo vers handcrafted wood she shall case on and my kyocera hydro the second outside pocket has able to hold my headphones and data cables fine unfortunately I am going to have to return this and get a better case,147,30
5492,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,3.0,neutral,it is a handsome case that would fit a smartphone flashlight multi-tool and an extra cc and/or cash however the thing has no belt-loop it has a flimsy plastic belt clip attached to an un-reinforced that is no backing rear face of the pouch if you put the items described above into it it will flop around until one of 2 things happen the belt clip breaks or the belt clip rips from the rear material of the pouch this pouch is not meant to be carried on a belt if you carry anything heavier than a smartphone on the plus side the pouch does come with a carabiner with lanyard that can be attached to a loop on the pouch in this fashion the pouch can be worn around ones neck,132,31
5493,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,the only problem with this is the strap is not large enough to go across the body over shoulder and neck the case itself is perfect the case easily holds an iphone the credit cards / identification money keys and some treats for the puppy i was able to use a different strap easily attached for across the body i love this case,61,32
5494,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,1.0,negative,this is a great designbut poorly implemented and very poorly manufactured i bought several of these and they each lasted no more than one month glue oozes onto your phone screen from inside the pouch and the belt clip rips out far too easily i wore them only during very light activities indoors and in cars very disappointing,60,33
5495,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,4.0,positive,i bought this to carry my cell phone sansung s 4 g it fits a little tight but is good if your a busy mom and need be in the run and also if u do not want to carry ur purse around this is good for it,46,34
5496,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,5.0,positive,it is perfect for those days you do not want to carry a purse i love this case and the different options to carry it,23,35
5497,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,i have to agree with what most of the others have said the belt clip is a horrible design it is too low on the case which makes the case stick out when you wear it although i have not broke the belt clip yet I have snagged it several times it is just a matter of time before i break the belt clip i think i would have liked this much better if they had just sewed in a belt-loop about an inch higher on the case that alone would have turned my 2 stars into 5 stars i really like the case itself it looks really good and it is ideal for my needs my cell phone ear-buds thumb-drives and ink pen fit perfectly for this reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 2 stars due to the horrible belt clip design i can not recommend this case,145,36
5791,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i use these for my tablet wow what a difference than listening to the crappy built in speakers you can hear bass and everything the black rubbery part that goes into your ear is kind of flapping around it is not solid behind it which means it is more comfy for different size ear holes but also means it will be easy to tear we will see how long they will last but sound quality is the best from all earphones I have even had,80,0
5792,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,the headset that came with my iphone 4 finally died so i needed to replace them i really did not want to spend 35 on a replacement since the original apple ear pieces did not really fit in my ear that well i have small ears so i thought I had give these a try considering they only cost 150 i did not expect much and would not have cared if they did not work at all but to my surprise they do a decent job i can hear clearly and the people I have called so far said they could hear me just fine just as well as any other time they have spoken to me while i was wearing a hands free headset i just received them yesterday so i can not speak to their durability or how well they are made but for the price I am pretty happy I am going to order a bunch to keep around in case they do not last long or get lost so far I had say this is a good buy,168,1
5793,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i purchased the blue ear buds for myself because the factory ones did not fit my ears the 35 mm in ear bud fit very snug with no worry of falling out at the least little move they are fairly easy and comfortable to put in place wit hno worry the sound is grreat i am very hapy with my purchase on top of it it came real soon after ordering,69,2
5794,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,so far the ear buds are great for the money you get a high quality metal headset sensitive mic with on-off and a decent length cord perfect for what i need sound quality is average considering the headset is so reasonably priced they were perfect for me worth trying if you want cheap decent headphones with good mic,58,3
5795,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,they work great i can hear and so can everyone else they are pretty comfortable in my ears too i use this in my htc inspire phone,27,4
5796,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,they work good but they did not last for me,9,5
5797,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,ummmmmm yeah my mom taught me if you do not have anything nice to say do not say anything at all i wish i could say some nice things about these they were supercheap once i tried to use them i understood why hey but i gave them an extra star for at least looking cool,51,6
5798,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,one was shorter than the other and after a day one headphone stop working,14,7

5803,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,phones were metal and have good sound but because of the microphone one side was 20 inches longer than other,20,12

5807,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,works well sound is excellent it would have nice if there was a clip that when being used it would be held in a comfortable position for the user but other than that it is a good product,38,16

5818,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,do not purchase these they advertise good sound quality minimal static and more when in fact it is the complete opposite the earbud rubber pieces did not fit the buds like they should have it was made out of a cheap thin metal and the sound quality is complete crap it is unbelievably full of frequency and they were overall a horrible purchase they came in a tiny bubble wrapped package and they were all bunched up and the package arrived about a week late awful awful product,85,27

5824,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,these headphones have an excellent price because of that you can not expect a killer pair of headphones but for someone like me who is always losing things they are perfect the sound quality is not stellar and gets worse as the volume increases but it is better than i predicted for such an affordable product overall my opinion is that you are getting what you pay for when you buy this product an affordable working pair of headphones with a working microphone,83,33

5850,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,sound quality is good and they are comfortable in the ears the only improvement would be the length of the wire from the ear bud to the microphone one side is longer than the other overall they are a good value for the money,44,59
5851,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,the sound is mediocre but that is what you get for 399 and the rubber not soft silicone ear pieces hurt and are not very pliable it takes several weeks to get to the us i live on the west coast but even then it took 3 or so weeks to arrive as it is shipped from china i would not buy these again a better brand for a bit more is skullcandy much better quality and they do not hurt,80,60
5852,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,these earbuds are okay obviously you can not expect much for the price sound is good mic quality is ok but i did not like that one earbud was longer than the other,31,61

5861,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,sound quality is decent but the bass is about as non-existent as you would expect everything outside the bass range comes through very clearly and the sound is not at all tinny theis exactly as pictured these hang off the left side rather than being centered so the cord to the right earbud is significantly longer than the left i kinda have to jam them into my ear holes to make them stay but I am not sure if that is the products problem or just me having weird-shaped ears,90,70
5862,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,the headphones that i revived from amazon broke the speakers stoles working after the first time using them with my phone,21,71
5863,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,i use these for both phone calls on my iphone 4s and regular ear buds for my ipod while at work the sound is great except that it picks up the vibrations from what the cords are rubbing up against especially a zipper other than that these get the job done and I had recommend them,55,72

5866,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,i had a few extra dollars from a gift card and decided to see how these worked as just earbuds to listen to music and was surprised with the decent quality for the low price and the microphone on them worked decently as well a good buy for the price,50,75
5867,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,i knew as soon as i picked them up they were cheap but you get what you pay for the housing was nice but the audio quality was absolutely disgusting they do not fit very well in your ear so you get this tunnel sound over all they are not that nice,51,76
5868,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,not worth the money they both broke in about the period of time less than a month save your time and money eforcity products sucks i bough other products from the same company and they broke in less than a month,41,77
5869,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,works alright sound quality is not terrible for the price but the right earbud shocks me on occasion it is not a pleasant sensation and it occurs once every 30 seconds or so not really worth shipping them back because of the price the microphone quality is below average and people ask me to repeat myself frequently,56,78

5873,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,the eforcity 35 mm in-ear earbud headset with itouch 4 g with blue mic was damaged when i received it i gave this1 star then clever edgar gave me a refund in hopes of me removing my bad review and i was harassed several times for me to remove my negative feedback i also believe they use an automated email program designed to send standardized harassing emails to people that give negative feedback i have reported the issue with amazon and i urge others not to buy from this seller giving a refund does not put me in good graces with anyone if you sell me rubbish you will get negative feedback from me case closed,116,82
5874,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,these are perfect this is my 4th set only because i keep losing them or one of the kids takes mine after losing theirs they work perfectly just as well as sets 10 times as much,36,83

5896,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i hated them because the sound quality was bad and within a week of purchasing them the left earbud stopped working and about 4 days later the right side stopped as well these earbuds did not last very long at all and were not worth my time,46,105

5899,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,i read the reviews before purchasing but decided to give it a 6 try anyway the quality of the plug and microphone module seems adequate but I am afraid that the cords will pull right out of the ear buds sound quality is horrible considering they are in-ear head phones definitely did not expect them to be that bad music sounds flat and muted phone conversations sound muddied and i have to hold the microphone to my mouth to get the other person to hear tried these with my motorola droid razr would not purchase again,95,108

5905,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,bought this product with hopes of using it with my ipod for internet phone calls it does work but the quality leaves a bit to be desired worst part is the construction is pretty flimsy and if not careful the unit will come apart and the wires will become exposed for the price it works ok but do not expect greatness,61,114

5910,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,not very good sound quality but decent for what you pay for since it has a remote and mic usually most headphones cost twice as much remote is a bit awkwardly placed and the cord is a bit short but not a hindrance,43,119

5918,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,the head phones work great but one ear piece is longer than the other so if they were both the same length it would be better but for the money it is worth it,33,127
5919,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i chose this rating because when i got them in the mail both of the earbubs where broken off so I am gon na need my money back or you send me other pair i better here from you all very soon or this matter will be presented in court,47,128

5935,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,these look and feel really cool but i can not hear them with my setup hardly at all so that makes them worthless to me maybe i can find someone that can get them to work with their phone better and give them away if not then throw them away,49,144

5938,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,the ear phones cord is longer on one side over the other and they will not stay in my ears i like both sides of the headset to be equal length and i felt like i had to turn my head sideways to get them to work correctly they sounded just ok there are other headset on the market that are much better for about the same money try the motorola headsets for about 440,75,147

5943,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,it is okay the ear bud is not the best it hurts your ears at first and it is kind of hard to hear when on the phone i think the mic is too low,35,152

5951,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i got these thinking oh these really cool and they have a great price but i was wrong i listened to one song at half volume and about 3/4 through the song the speakers blew out or something plus the way the headphones wires are is very uncomfortable and the mic is allways in your face i would rather use the standard apple headphones then these,66,160
5952,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,when i got the headphones one of them where broken and that made me mad because i had to go buy more at the store for my cousins birthday,29,161

5957,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,i received these very quickly but as the headline is you get what you pay for the sound is terrible and all blotchy sounding the headphones in the picture do not look like the ones i received the headphone jack and the mic were both tin shiny blue and the headphone ear buds themselves were a cheap light blue plastic the headphones smelled like harsh chemicals and the ear bud plastic was melted slightly to the cord overall i give it 2 stars if you want good cheap headphones under 15 try ifrogz,92,166
5958,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,I am gon na make it short and simple and not complain like everyone else truth is you get what you pay for this here is low budget ear phones so do not expect them to have dre beat qualities although other head phones have good base these head phones do not although i said it before the price says it all it is true but i recommend this product to anyone who honestly does not want to spend much or is saving money for even better head phones i think that is all i have to say although i just wasted typing space oh well do not feel like pressing the back space uhh cheap and buy them if you want low end head phones laughing out loud I had rate the base 3/10 headphones themselves 6/10,128,167

5965,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,the price of this product makes you realize that your are not getting top of the line but i at least expected it to be better than the check-stand ear buds from walmart i was wrong the durability of the product is good and the phone functions are also good but the sound is incredibly high on the treble and the bass is basically nonexistent even after adjusting my phones settings for the music player droid razr maxx the sound is still horrible while not a bad product it should be marketed only for phone calls and not for recreational use for entertainment,102,174
5966,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,happy with buying these i have tried different kinds and had to return most of them these were cheap and work great,22,175

5968,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,this is a terrible product do not waste your money never will i buy this again it sounds like there is water in the earbuds and the volume keeps shifting,29,177
5969,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,i have had these headphones for about a month and a half and they are still going strong the mic does not work although so if you are not buying it for the mic then it is a great buy for a great price,44,178
5970,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i am pleased to have ordered these headphones they are very clear they control the calls and the music the microphone is very clear as well i never have a problem hearing or speaking to someone i would definitely order from this seller again,44,179

5977,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,only lasted me around 2 months i used it every day while i was on the bus pretty cheap when i got it so i do not mind,27,186
5978,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,these are probably the best earphones I have ever owned usually I am blasting my music at full volume i have an iphone 4 g with this i am rocking out at with 4 - 5 bars and it does not seep out music c it also blocks out lots of obnoxious background noise which is great the mic is also really nice and the button works to start / stop music and pick up / end phone calls for like 3 this is such an amazing bargain i can not believe it c i also love theshipping was good too,92,187
5979,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,these headphones arrived extremely fast from a third party seller however upon hooking these up the left side of the headphones would not emit any sound also why would one cord be longer than the other not really sure why they made the product that way bottom line you can find a much better pair of headphones for a little bit more money that will give you no problems,69,188
5980,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,terrible very flimsy particularly at the connection point with audio quality so bad i can barely make out what is being said got these for the extremely low price but they are not even worth owning as a backup,39,189
5981,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,these headphones are what you expect for such a low price the sound quality is really bad and there is a terrible echoing effect,24,190
5982,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i use these all the time they are very comfortable and easy to use i would recommend them to anyone that wants a good set,25,191
5983,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,to be honest i can say that the sound that these earphones give off are quite stunning however as soon as i took these put of the packaging unfolded the twist tie one of the earbud strings were rather short 2 1/2 per say while the other is around 6 inches long i look very stupid with one ear bud way shorter than the other it seems as if i custom made the earphones myself i would not purchase nor reccommend this product to anyons due to my experience of having a crappy first one currents,95,192
5984,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,my 12 year old grandson ordered these from the amazon website they lasted about 10 days before one of the earbuds broke in half he did not abuse them one just snapped,33,193
5985,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,earphones arrived as promised and work ok they seem to have a cheaper gerenic sound with hardly any type of bass to it not really what i wanted but my 9 year old likes them and soo far they have survived,41,194
5986,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,poor quality product the housing for the speaker seems like aluminum there is a sharp corner on it which irritates the ear the microphone component is large and so far up one of the ear cables that it pulls on the bud and exacerbates the sharpissue also the microphone is of poorer input quality than the speakers are of output two stars because they are cheap and will output low-quality sound,72,195
5987,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,they look good and fit well in the ear but that is it one side was longer than the other while on the phone i heard static and the other person says i broke up alot because of the price point i did not return them figured you get what you pay for so i used them with my portable dvd player instead of my cell phone and they last for 2 movies then died the look and price both look good but do not waste your money,87,196
5988,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i was skeptical but they work extreamly well much better than the ones you see in electronic stores going for 20 30 i should know i have gone through about 4 pairs of the in the last 8 months the last pair of skull candies i purchased stunk i was hearing an echoing effect every time the wire would move horrible you can not beat the price of these work well and the soung quality is great,77,197
5989,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,they are awesome the bass on these are off the wall they are comfortable in the ears just wish the wire were the same length i already bought 3 one 4 me 2 for friends n they love them as well,41,198
5990,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,they do not live uptp the mark no bass no treble hence i had to order another pair of headphones,20,199
5991,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,i got it in the mail quite fast and started using them right away it was not until i started using them that i noticed a few things i did not like it has the microphone that makes one chord much longer than the other and it becomes quite bothersome also they did not stay in my ears very well if i started walking around they were not all i made them out to be but for the most part they looked really cool so I had say they were pretty awesome but i would not exactly recommend this to a friend sorry,99,200
5992,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,i got on time and used for a while but the earbud came off i really have an opinion on this but what it is,25,201
5993,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,weighed more than i was used to for ear buds when i tried to use them 1 earbud did not produce any sound fail,24,202
5994,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,it is been less then a week and one headphone has broken already I shall adtmit the sound quality is verry good,20,203
5995,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,this product is exactly what i was looking for i like the comfort of the buds and it works fine on my phone the only thing is randomly it makes crazy noise in my ear,35,204
5996,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,after 3 months of use there is no sound coming from the left earpiece i guess you get what you pay for,22,205
5997,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,these earbuds have almost no bass and a low signal level overall on the other hand they are very cheap i accidentally left them in my pants pocket when the pants went through the washing machine the earbuds came out clean and still worked,44,206
5998,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,i got this product to see if i liked the kinds of earbuds they were they were nice but one earbud is longer than the other and the plug started to come off the cable the sound was ok not any thing special like apple earbuds,46,207
5999,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,perfectly works with htc evo 3d good sound and good headphones for the price will not get better it is even better than gogroove audiohm hf black ergonomic earbud headset with hands-free microphone for htc samsung motorola iphone nokia lg and more smartphones,49,208
6000,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,really really bad they were almost unbearable the first two times i used them excrutiatingly tinny and by the third time they were actually buzzing as if the speakers had blown even although i had only used them to listen to audio books at moderate volumes just total junk,48,209
6001,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,these headphones / earbuds are great when i decided to buy this product i was very sketchy because of the price and bad reviews but they are great mic works fantastic on my samsung flight 2 phone and the headphones sound great in my kindle fire do not let the low price and bad reviews fool you this is a great buy the reason i gave it only 4 stars as appossed to 5 is because one headphone is shorter than the other because of the mic but that is the oooooonly problem,90,210
6002,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,with some of the songs it sounds weird but other then that the ear phones themselves are good i like the length of the wire but did not like the wire that goes around your neck would not have brought them if i had known another problem was it did not tell me about where it was coming from and how much it would cost from that area it cost me a lot of money and i am not happy about that the seller needs to put where the product is being shipped from and how much this will be thanks,98,211
6003,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,these head phones are ok exept when it comes to the mic it picks up more background noise than it should as far as the sound it is descent but i found that all it took was an app from android and the sound became great their customer service is great after i contacted them they were extremely nice and took great care of me,65,212
6004,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i purchased these to replace another earbud headset and thought they would work for music too while they might sound ok for a voice when used with a phone they are terrible terrible terrible for music the construction is mostly aluminum or some light metal and feels like it is quality durable construction there is absolutely zero bass and it sounds very tinny but then again what can you really expect for only a few dollars for what i had hoped to use these for music they are not going to work at all,91,213
6005,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,i purchased these for my 12 year old who seems to go through headphones and earbuds like they are disposable these last quite a bit longer than average and have very good sound,33,214
6006,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i could not believe the price and the picture then i said what the heck let us just order it only couple of bucks anyway so i did and beyond impressed if u lose or break ur earphones all the time like me u need these telling u,44,215
6007,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,i would give this product 5 stars except there has no volume control on the headset or if there is I am too stupid to figure it out,26,216
6008,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,these have good sound using them on my iphone comparable to the factory buds they are tough ear buds i accidentally washed and dryed them thought they were toast plugged them in and they worked perfectly the only thing that i do not really care for is that the right bud wire is longer than the left so it can go behind your neck if you like buds like that then great but i hardly ever use them that way,79,217
6009,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,these are awful headphones 1 the wire leading to the right earpiece is 6 inches long whereas the one leading to the left is 18 inches long completely unpractical to use 2 the rubber covering the on / off switch for the mic fell out after pressing the button the first time perhaps i received a dud for the price it is not worth my time to return,66,218
6010,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,ordered 2 sets as the price looked right and i liked the appearance of them the sound is good and construction seems ok however one earbud cord is way longer than the other and it is annoying as other reviews have covered i do not get why they would design it like this shipping from seller was fairly fast,57,219
6011,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,pros inexpensive cons arrive in box addressed to purchaser or current resident no packing slip contained in the box left side is rather grainy,24,220
6012,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i bought these earbuds thinking they would be a piece of junk since i only payed about three dollars for them when i got them they worked amazingly the on / off switch worked and the built in mic worked my favorite part is if you hold the on / off button down voice control come up and you can use it to switch songs look for songs face time only if you have an ipod 4 or an iphone and a lot more,80,221
6013,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i was excited to get these today they looked pretty cool and they were going to match my new mp3 player i just bought as well well i pulled them out of the package put them in my ears felt comfortable and just fit really well well while inspecting the on / off button for the mic i pushed the button and that whole component literally fell apart from just pushing a button meant for pushing now it will not stay together and only one side works i guess it was to good to be true,93,222
6014,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,hello i purchased thisbecause of price and great reviews i assumed you could pull on the wires to make the right and left earbuds wires lengths the same distance from the mic cylinder they are not even and i ended up pulling the mic electronics right out of the mic cylinder with very little force on the wires there should be instructions with the product that tells you that you can not adjust the earbuds wire lengths that is distance to the mic cylinder the left earbud wire length is like twice the right earbud wire length and the lengths are not adjustable i never even got to use the product update just bought 999 spoke skullcandy 2xl silicone earbuds at officemax store in person they work great fit great are worth the price have ambient chatter reduction and comes with two different pairs of silicone gel earbud sizes one large set one small set,156,223
6015,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,they were shipped quickly but after one use the rubber piece on the ear bud fell off then after the second use the left one stopped working,27,224
6016,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i ordered two sets of these buds to keep in the car and for emergencies right after using one pair it stopped working immediately on one side the ear buds comes only in one size which is a bit small for me and they are also metal and i would personally say they are really heavy also the mic side has less cord than the non mic side making the weight distribution uneven because they are so heavy if one side falls out the other bud gets ripped out of your ear at full speed then you are left scrambling saying wait what as you shove these back in your ears they also make a buzzing sound if you volume is too high overall cheap heavy buds and may not work shop another product,134,225
6017,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,save your money appears comfortable enough but easily falls off the ear the sound fades for no reason and is muffled,21,226
6018,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,the voice and music quality for this headset is what i would consider below average but then again the whole thing including shipping was only 442 so i can not complain too much i use this as a backup in the event that i lose my main headset,47,227
6019,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,these headphones arrived in good condition and work which is all that i was expecting one ear cord is longer than the other which may be annoying to some people,30,228
6020,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,they work but barely when i plug them into my ipod they will short out and like switch on and off and i was kind of dissapointed,26,229
6021,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,broke after one use only got sounds out of one side spend the extra money and buy a different pair sending these back,23,230
6022,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,they have really good sound and i love the mic but i hate how they do not have different sizes of earbuds they constantly slip out of my ears one more than the other i hate that wish i could return these,41,231
6023,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,would have had a five star review but they came two days late they are very comfortable and very loud the only thing i do not get is that the right plug is longer than the left but it has a clip attached so i guess that so you can clip it on your shirt and neither wire will hang down love them,61,232
6024,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,okay so i like a deal 144 and well usually when i see mixed reviews well i usually like the product not this time after trying to use this piece of junk i will pay full price for a pair of iphone earbuds there was just blah the look nice but do not be fooled do no buy,57,233
6025,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,this equipment also known as piece of crap is one of the worst earphones i have experienced in my life one speaker does not even work and the positive reviews are fake and it broke in about an hour do not waste your time on this crap,43,234
6026,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i bought these for the good price and good looks i did not expect them to sound as good as they do they sound great they fit in my ear and do not fall out well worth the money,39,235
6027,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,goodtoo bad they could not stay in my ears so i sold them for alot more like then tho,20,236
6028,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,the product works but i do not understand and i have ask anyone that would listen why the length of one cord leading to the ear bud is twice the lenght of the other it is awkward i think it should be advertised this flaw irregularity in this product will not purchase this again,54,237
6029,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,so one thing i really enjoyed about the seller of thisis thewas shipped out the next day and arrived at the exact start date as the estimated delivery the ear buds were very useful when enjoying music at higher and lower volumes some minor flaws i found with the design of the product was that the ear buds at first were uncomfortable they sunk deeply into my ear canal but after an hour or two this no longer became an issue this in return made the ear buds have a firm grip to my ears that secured them in place so they did not fall out the mic was hard to connect to my windows operating system and was not recognized but i do have a feeling that it was only an issue with my computer but the design and placement of the mic control was not helpful either over all a quality product and worth the money definitely the look of the headphones are very professional and have a sexy design I had recommend using the ear buds as headphones instead of a microphone overall great quality product entrez,193,238
6030,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,i originally got these so i could watch movies on my nookas it is external sound is pretty low i was pleasantly surprised especially considering the price at how well they work actually i had not even realized there was a microphone included one minor complaint is that i am unable to tell if the microphone is on or off without testing it i have only used it for a skype call the headphones worked perfectly on my nookux31e zenbook and 1000he netbook for some reason on my main tower the microphone did not work and the headphones would give me sound in one ear although if plugged into speakers connected to the tower it was fine apparently it is only partially the towers issue as other headphones plugged into the towers headphone jack gave sound in both ears this is a minor issue for me as i do not often need headphones with the tower with every other device i tried however the headphones and microphone were fine surprisingly good for a two dollar accessory quality was not tremendous but for the price i think it merits 4 stars and would think so even if it were ten dollars more,199,239
6031,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,works well no volume control but the remote start / stop / pause / skip works well sound quality is good enough for listening to podcasts may not be perfect for music but good enough for me,31,240
6032,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i received a defective product one side of the earbud set is actually 12 longer than the other the buds hurt my ears and will not stay put i did not even bother to test them with my iphone as others have said you get what you pay for heed their comments i did not unfortunately,52,241
6033,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,these ears buds are horrible it is hard to hear out of them and the other person says they can barely hear you you definitely get what you paid for just going to keep it as a back up,38,242
6034,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,the mic and earbuds work well enough for a voice conversation but there is practically no bass at all so music will sound horrible not recommended,26,243
6035,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,it is the worst kind of headset i have ever purchased for my htc sensation call drops and music starts automatically microphone makes lots of noise that annoys the person on the other side waste of money,35,244
6036,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,very nice for the price good quality and decent sound for the money high quality metal construction very nice set of buds,22,245
6037,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,poor quality broke soon as i opened it poor poor poor quality you get what you pay for do not waste your money,23,246
6038,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,you have to have these headphones they are greatttt they are clear niceand light def worth it I am goinf to order 3 more do not hesiitate get them laughing out loud,30,247
6039,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,no one can hear me when i talk into the mic that makes me sad defeats the purpose i could have bought some regular headphones,25,248
6040,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,first of all looking at price makes anyone wonder if they are going to get a wired piece of junk but no it is not junk at all the sound quality is really decent and the mic sounds clear to anyone i chatting with my only suggestion to any user would be that they should use only the left ear when driving because these ear buds are nice and snug having one in each ear really does block out the sound of the outside world which is not cool while driving i have used the mic and buds in a fairly loud environment and i was able to hear the person on the other end talking to me in a situation like that two buds is a greatmusic the sound is flat and clean but not bass heavy it is not what i would use to listen to music normally but i was listening to a pod cast while waiting for a call to come in and the sound was fine for my professional ears nice value decent sound,179,249
6041,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,i got a pair of these for my son to use with his ipod touch the mute button on them is recognized by the ipod itself and will pause his music for him he absolutely loves this feature they are very comfortable so long as you like in-the-ear earbuds the only complaint that i have is that they did not come with the standard small and large replacement tips for those with larger or smaller than average ears my son is one of those people with smaller ears so i ended up having to swap the tips out with an extra set i had laying around that came with another brand in the end i ended up picking up a second one of these which my wife now uses they seem to hold up well to the abuse they have received so far and everyone is happy,146,250
6042,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,these produce absolutely no bass i listen to dubstep and these suck definitely will not purchase anything made by this brand again,20,251
6043,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,cheap microphone headset that does what it is suppose to people can hear me clearly and loudly and i can hear people as if i had the phone to my ear my only complaint is that sometimes sounds from the right earbud screech i think this is because of particular voices or sounds i tend to hear that sound when speaking with girls it is not bad just noticeable seriously although how can i really complain for something this cheap,79,252
6044,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,bought it a week back mic quality is good and earphones output is also good need to find out if it is durable or not,25,253
6045,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,this product has the best sound quality but why does it say three pounds shipping weight they were super light i use them for my kindle fire and it sounds soooooo much better than the built in speakers,38,254
6046,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,earphones were good nut everyone i talked to said they could barely hear me all they hear is static i tried fixing the connection but did not work good as earphone although but crappy microphone,35,255
6047,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i am very picky about what i stick in my ear these ear buds not only work great but the also feel great a good value,26,256
6048,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i just got these headphones around 7 pm and it is about 9 now the headphones are made out of some nice thick metal and look very appealing the sound it pretty good the lows arnt too great but the highs and mids are good to use the mic just click the button once and then you can talk freely you do not have to be holding down the button to talk,82,257
6049,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,for as cheap as they are you can not go wrong under 5 including shipping wait a few days to ship and you saved at least 10 - 20 from visiting a local retailer when worn for 7 - 8 hours straight they seem to make my ear sore however that might just be my weird ears they stay in sound decent for the money and i listen to them at work every day at least 5 hours at a shot,76,258
6050,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,good fit in the ear without any problemslooks good does not feel cheap stay in ears good and the sound is right on the money good bass sound not distorted even when turned all the way up on my ipad3 and iphone 4s good mid and highs i listen to everything from 40s classics to top 10 current for the money they rock i also have skull candy and they are on par with earbuds costing 10 times as much,81,259
6051,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,3.0,neutral,the price is great 157 but if i could do it again I had be better off just paying the extra money the mic is heavy so hard to run with if you need a spare set to keep in your bag for making phone calls and listening to music and are not concerned with sound quality i would recommend them,61,260
6052,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,i use for 30 minutes in the gym when it fold down fron the chair when i see it is broke,23,261
6053,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,i purchase it fits good in ear the sound is great i order 2 more for friends and they love it also onne more thing i always have problems with one ear going out but our 4 months and going great earbuds,42,262
6054,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,delivered in a thin cushioned envelope does not look like the price i paid for it it is actually very nice to look at the blue is somewhat metallic and looks pretty cool i can hear people and they can hear me regardless of the mic being 4 - 5 inches from my mouth tangles just like any other set of ear buds if you toss them around carelessly might just be my ear but it falls out easily if I am careful it stays in but if you have long hair tie it back so it does not catch onto the wire when you go to move around it might fall out i use it on the 4th gen ipod touch for calling music sounds good other than doing it is job i can not say much else,131,263
6055,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,at first i was hesitant whether or not to purchase this product but I am glad i did these earbuds work very well great bass very loud and a great affordable price,31,264
6056,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,5.0,positive,when i received the package in the mail i was excited the shipping took precisely one week but it is well worth it the ear phones are just as described in the picture the ear phones have astounding sound quality and the microphone is great as well i also love that medal feature worth every penny so let us say you are listening to your music and you want to pause it you press the black button and it pauses it also works for answering call on your iphone,86,265
6114,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,all of the reviews saying this is cute and fits well are true upon arrival i was perfectly happy with this case but within two days the edges started peeling where the image is sort of laminated on it now looks like a mess oh well at least it was not pricey,51,0
6115,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,does not offer much in the way of protection i thought it was going to be textured but it is just flat all around a big old meh i like the 99 cent silicon cassette tape cover better,36,1
6116,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,the design is printed into the plastic so there has nothing that should wear or peel off over time i do not particularly like this style of case it barely covers the phone has no lip that comes around the front of the screen to protect the phone when setting it face-down on surfaces it is made of that plastic that has a slightly soft or velvet feel to it even although it is not coated with anything it is nice just a little more grippy the design is really adorable i love that it says 01134 so cute if you are looking for a really minimal hard snap-on case and you like the design you would like this case it is just not what i was looking for i thought maybe the buttons would be shaped in the plastic more or maybe feel like rubbery calculator buttons but the design is simply in the flat plastic it is still high-quality and very cute although,158,2
6117,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,this case looked great for about a week but the camera image completely wore off it is now just an ugly black case this is a horrible product,27,3
6118,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i love this case it is so cute and fits really well on my phone it is actually kind of hard to get off without fear of damaging it just make sure to clean your phone before you put it on and you should be all set i really love the look of it and actually the case is not super smooth plastic like other snap on cases so it has a bit more traction not much although,77,4
6119,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i love this case i think it is fun quirky and everyone compliments it i only give it 4 stars because i wish it covered the screen as well but for the amount you pay it is an awesome cover and great for protecting my phone,43,5
6120,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this case is absolutely wonderful gives your iphone 4 a perfect retro camera look got exactly what i was looking for the case has got a matte finish to it fits perfectly and have no trouble accessing the exterior buttons on the side go for it,46,6
6121,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this was the perfect gift for my husband he is a photographer and his phone now displays his work of art i would recommend this to others,27,7
6122,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,this is a very unique looking case however it does not do much to protect your expensive investment will spark a conversation although,22,8
6123,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for something unique this is it if you are looking for protection for your expensive phone keep looking,22,9
6124,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,hard plastic allows for it to slide in to your pocket easily and it was one of the best cases that got the most recognition it is paint ob held up well and only until the end did it finally start to break up,43,10
6125,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,awesome cover for my iphone 4s i got a lot of comments and people even asked me where i got it from does not protect phone at all,28,11
6126,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i love the image look shape and feel of the case but the image peeled off like a sticker after only about a week total bummer,26,12
6127,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i was highly disappointed with the quality of thisi absolutely did not put it on my phone the picture of the camera is fuzzy and pixelated horrible quality embarrassing,31,13
6128,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,the photos do not match thei received these ones are not original i ordered these products because they were original and they were under the fred and friends and all i got was something that looks printed out and homemade very very low quality i do not recomend this seller,51,14
6129,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,iphone retro camera case does not look like it does in the photo the photo is more realistic and more 3 dimensional the camera case i received was cheap looking and looks like the image was flat and pixelated i think i overpaid for this case,46,15
6130,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i got the radio cover as a christmas gift in less then a month the paint started chipping after leaving a trail of chipped away radio everywhere i go i scratched the rest off I am hoping the case itself will last me until the new iphone is released,49,16
6131,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,definitely not what the pictures shows it looks like someone printed out a picture of a camera with a printer that was running out of ink and glued it to the back of a cheap flimsy iphone case no thank you to cheap to resale so i will be giving this away,52,17
6132,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,the snap cover does not stand proud of the front glass it is fit does not feel secure it is glossy so offers no more grip than the glass the phone can slide up and down about 1 mm which is disconcerting when you go to press the lock button on top the graphic looks cool although but i think i will return to a better snap case that has some texture and covers the front edges it is a shame it was not made better i have a lot of other fred products that i like a lot,95,18
6133,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i think the case looks better thicker and a little bit cooler on line once i received it was thin and some what cheap looking it is a good fix if you break your favorite one i guess so just okay,40,19
6134,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i personally do not like this one it was good at first then within the first week the paint stared chipping off,22,20
6135,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,the calculator design is great makes your phone seem like a vintage calculator great for tricking your friends or breaking thehowever protection wise not so great the cover is made of really weak plastic and does not offer much protection for your iphone personally i cracked it within a week,51,21
6136,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,for the price you can not really complain as a photographer it is a great signature fo rmyself and people love it the black paint wears easily on the edges and itsnt built for a long life is not really bulit for more then just looks however it was fun to have,50,22
6137,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i purchased this case in the calculator design it is cute and a bit of a conversation starter after a month or so one of the sides broke off i constantly drop my phone and this case provides little protection so I have had to switch if you are looking for something cool get this but if you need to keep your phone safe I had pass,65,23
6138,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,this is a great case works well for work u can set it down and it look like a office calculator this product needs a little help it does not hold up to excessive use with in two days started to rub off,43,24
6139,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this awesome retro case was the exacti was looking for I shall just say that if you are looking for an iphone case that protects the front of the screen then this is not the case for you this is just a backing case but i love it nonetheless and have not had any problems with it but then again I am a nazi about taking care of my things i have made it a point to secure this iphone baby at all times to ensure the glass does not crack,88,25
6140,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i find this to produce a nice retro camera look the graphics are high quality and durable on the phone i get compliments on it i have a 4s and the room for the buttons is fine,37,26
6141,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i saw the other reviews and thought i was being very careful to protect my case but within a couple of weeks it was very scuffed and dirty will probably end up throwing it out if you are buying it for novelty value be aware you will not get much use out of it,53,27
6142,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,love this product it fits perfectly and the graphics are beautiful it is very nostalgic for me but none of my much younger coworkers have anywhat a transistor radio is,32,28
6143,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,all aspects of order handling and delivery good but product has one minor flaw in my opinion it does not quite come all the way to the front of the phone the mark of a good slimline case to me is an almost imperceptible lip over the front so that the phone can be placed face down without the screen coming in to contact with whatever surface it is placed on,70,29
6144,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i purchased this for my iphone 4s and it fits perfectly no hassles what-so-ever i can access all buttons and use the usb charger with the case on I am not for sure if the case is made well sure it feels strong but is it strong enough i guess I shall find out when i eventually drop my phone anyhow my only real complaint is the camera sticker / cover is not sharp and rich in detail it is not pixelated but simply looks blurred or the cover used came from a scanned image kinda upsetting but i have no intentions on sending the product back or buying an alternative case / cover also my phone did not arrive in the package as pictured above it was opened and bubble wrapped,125,30
6145,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this is a hard plastic cover that fits snugly but allows room for the function buttons i had a transistor radio when i was a kid so i love the way the case looks very clever product shipped quickly and was reasonably priced,43,31
6146,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i was under the impression that this was more than just a photo reproduction on a flat glassy surface that aside the design is upside down if you want to use the volume button to take photos holding the phone horizontally the design on the case is upside down from how you are holding the camera iphone it should be right side up in alignment with how you would click a camera button the photo of the man in the picture is a misrepresentation of the product i received,89,32
6147,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,the case is very cute which is why i bought it in the first place the back has a non slip surface which i also liked however it is only been a month and theis starting to peel off totally ruins the effect of the case,47,33
6148,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i like this cover works perfect for my iphone 4s the only draw back is i thought it was matte but it is actually super shiney and gets finger prints on it very easily I shall probly end up gifting it,39,34
6149,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,the case is good for the price the case does not cover the volume buttons bottom or top of the phone,21,35
6150,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,thisis extremely handy especially when traveling it is not the sturdiest but it does the job well the first time i used it i could not figure out how to screw on the part that connects to the top it is a little tricky but it does work you may be able to find a better iphone tripod stand that costs more but if you are looking to save money this is a great choice,73,0
6151,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,i purchased to use with ipod touch right out of the package the tripod was flimsy the holder can not even hold the weight of the ipod i do not recommend this product at all as a matter of fact i have been looking for an inexpensive quality tripod and have yet to find one I have purchase at least three and have essentially wasted my money and time i am now looking to find a quality product for a bit more money to get the job done,85,1
6152,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,everyone seems to think they have to buy name brand gadget accessories when the force of attraction between wallet ipod iphone and compatible devices starts to rear it is proverbial ugly head usually your pockets become lighter and you have nothing to show over some generic product that can be sourced at a ridiculously lower cost enter the mini tripod stand holder this thing does what it says it stands your i-device on three legs and allows you a few axes of adustment it is a simple design so it is patent has probably run out in the kodak days allowing for various injection molding shops west of hawaii to extend their reach past button making so what does all this mean for us amazon shoppers a great product at a great price that is been functional and reliable in relatively modern use for the last year in my case certainly I had give this as a stocking stuffer or an office gift if i saw someone scratching their phone across their desk daily listening to pandora or maybe it would make a great gift for that person who uses their phone more as a camera than anything else regardless this is a good product at a good value that is not hard to make and probably pretty difficult to screw up so go ahead take thebreak free from the affection you have towards aftermarket distributors who try to build a brand and build profit margins on your loyalty buy one of these no-name stands and you will be glad you did and you will probably start changing your accessory-shopping habits from the experience,272,2
6153,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,the iphone holder works reasonable well but the tripod only functions in landscape / horizontal position in the portrait / vertical position the tripods legs do not expand wide enough to prevent the camera from tipping over placing the iphone in the holder is somewhat cumbersome as you need to pull and hold the spring loaded clamp with one hand while sliding in the iphone with the other hand using a better tripod fixes the tipping problem i suggest the company replace the tripod or sell just the holder without the tripod,88,3
6154,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,well i liked it till i accidentally drop it and it broke but the tripod will not hold the weight of an i phone in a vertical position so i just used it it horizontally great for washing show on the phone it is an ok product to play around with i will order another one to replace it it is cheap enough and i will try it to drop it,72,4
6155,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,the holder is good and the legs could be a little bit longer but for the price it is really good the opener should open about a half inch bigger the legs are more durable than i thought they would be,41,5
6156,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,the holding arm comes right off when you try opening it to fit with your case on,27,6
6157,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,I shall start by saying that thiswas not very expensive but it would have been worth getting a more expensive one the spring that holds the phone is way to strong the portrait position does not even slightly work if you try to put it in portrait position it always falls over lastly the ball joint positioning is all or none if you do not crank the screw down the phone flops down so this stand sort of works but it is made so cheaply that it should be free with a purchase,90,7
6158,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,the tripod seems sturdy enough but only marginally stable i bought this for the holder to use with a real tripod since it was cheaper than other ways to put a camera mount on smart phone,36,8
6159,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,i love this mini-tripod because i used this for the video conference facetime unfortunately it is broken i tried to pry iphone4 off and the holder of the tripod fell off,31,9

6161,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,i love this stand it is just a little flimsy takes some time to get just right and hold a position,21,11
6162,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,this tripod is very small and handy works for my iphone i use it to record our sunday class at church every sunday it worked great for quite a few months then something fell off from the product it broke i will not recommend this product it is a great price but you get what you pay for it just will not last the quality is not great,65,12
6163,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,worked good until i droppped it once and the legs broke,11,13
6164,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,nice mini tripod for an iphone when needing table top video or images the legs are study for this lightweight device and the ball head allows you to move it in any direction for more creative angles i have used this with middle school students and it held up quite well in their hands easy to store flat,58,14
6165,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,the spring broke quickly it barely held my 4 galaxy s blaze the spring broke although and absolutely will not hold a phablet,23,15
6166,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,this was very cool for the low price but is not very sturdy and one of the legs was wobbling so i had to take it apart and tighten a screw but it was good for the price,37,16
6167,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,five star because it broke but fixed it really easy,10,17
6168,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,a little more flimsy than what i expected but for the price it was ok the little phone holder broke the very first time i used it it is held by a tiny spring that is time consuming to put back on so be careful,45,18
6169,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,it was for my son but he found it confusing and wobbly,12,19
6170,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,when first buying this product i felt that this product was not going to look the way it was advertised but suprisingly it was perfect and as soon as i opened the package i was already making videos and taking photos with it pros small and sturdy good quality strong clamp mechanism cons not good for phones with alot of side buttons,62,20
6171,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,thisis awesome exactly what i expected,8,21

6176,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,in general this tripod holder works fine however my htc one will not fit without taking it out of the skin / case,20,26

6178,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,after mounting this the first time the adapter simply snapped off i did not get a chance to use it to rate it otherwise,24,28
6179,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,such a great price for a great stand i absolutely love it such a great stand for my iphone,20,29

6183,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,i bought this as a stand for my phone to use for facetime it lasted but all of a month the cheap plastic hook part snapped,26,33
6184,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,fragile and poorly made i did not expect much given the price but this broke after 2 uses next time I shall spend a little more for a better product,28,34
6185,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,the crappy piece of metal that holds all 3 legs together broke the first time i tried to open it,20,35
6186,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,this was a piece of crap i got it and in one minute it broke because it could not balance save your money,22,36
6187,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,i got this so my kids could use their ipods to make lego stop-motion movies the mechanism that holds the ipod in place is really tight i was afraid it was too tight actually it might be because we have an ottorbox case on the ipods which is pretty bulky I had like it better if you could adjust the clips to a larger setting the legs are sturdy although and i do not worry about the ipod falling out,78,37
6188,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,the top clamp broke but it still gets the job done it is good for the price although works just fine,20,38
6189,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,it broke within 5 seconds after unboxing not worth it do not even think about buying this i hate it so much,21,39
6190,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,this broke immediatly while we were trying to get the phone in it do not buy piece of crap not worth your money,22,40
6191,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,it is very helpful but small that is ok although and the legs could entente to make it longer i would recommend it,22,41
6192,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,it does a great job during face talk the stand is good for the price easy to carry from palce to place,22,42
6193,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,nothing special here it holds the phone it is cheap and does not adjust easily it will also fall over if not balanced just right the top will rotate over for portrait shots but it does not go far enough and the shots will look tilted it just barely opens wide enough for my phone update legs are not attached securely and come off when you try to extend them,67,43
6194,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,i have a droid razar maxx and it worked for a while but eventually the spring that holds the phone tight broke i did not really like the plastic holder it should have been metal or aluminum it last for about 4 months,42,44
6195,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,i wish i had had the experience of a lot of the other reviewers but mine broke in two different places within a week of purchase i had to throw it away i know it is low cost but come on i wish i had spent the four bucks towards something that would last,53,45
6196,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,i did not mean to order this i only needed the adapter since i already have a tripod however if i did not have the tripod this would be very useful if could be taller for my specifications although,37,46
6197,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,it is okay however if not being placed on a stable table there may be problems since balance can be an issue smartphone tends to be a little top heavy for this,32,47
6198,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,hard to beat for the price holds most any smart phone securely i use head on a larger tripod for streaming video during my classroom lectures spring loaded arms block access to the screen however,35,48
6199,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,the first one i got was so stiff i could not get my phone in it so i contacted the seller and they sent me another one but that one was identical when i pulled on the piece to get the phone in i broke it so not recommending it but the seller was really nice,55,49
6200,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,it is basically a noveltythe legs are not that even the feet do not stay put and the actual holder is not that well made the entire thing is cheap and poorly made i would not recommend it,35,50
6201,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,i received this a couple of days ago and i honestly love it on problem in that one of the legs comes off but i could easily put glue in it and it will be fine i really like it because i get to record a lot of gloving videos and take good pictures without me worrying how still the camera will be worth the buy,65,51
6202,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,when i got the tripod which took a long time for it to ship i was incredibly disappointed because it was broken and even if it was not broken the tripod was so small and dinky you could not really do anything with it the only good thing was the top screwed of and i saw that the part that holds the iphone could screw onto a regular tripod but if you do not have a regular tripod do not bother with buying this piece of junk,83,52
6203,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,my iphone 4 did not fit in it and the top part broke on me when i tried pulling it up to make it fit it looked like someone glued it there,32,53
6204,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,i bought this for my 14 year old grandson because he has obsessed with making crazy videos he loves it and says that it works great,25,54
6205,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,a good tripod for your phone but does not fit large phones i have a nexus 4 and this does not fit it also it is kinda cheap and it broke easily but what can you expect for the price the only part that broke was where you try to put the phone in but it is okay because you can still place a phone and use it just will not be as sturdy but usable,73,55
6206,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,this tripod took forever to deliver it came all the way from china it litteraly only took 2 min before it broke i would never recommend this to anyone,29,56
6207,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,i order this for my samsung g3 and it did not fit one leg falls not made strong spend a little more money for something else,26,57
6208,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,I am not sure how thisreceived the high ratings it has mine arrive in a padded envelope broken into three pieces i just tossed it in the trash which is where it belonged before it ever left china actually i feel guilty having bought something that had to be manufactured assembled and then shipped half way across the globe all for under 4 dollars i would not have ordered it had i known it would be shipped from china but it is impossible to find out where this seller is physically located before you buy you get what you pay for which is nothing worth using even if it arrived intact,111,58
6209,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,this is an ok product my daughters wanted something to hold their ipod touch when they make videos this works well but it is very cheap plastic and i do not know how long it will last just remember you get what you pay for,44,59
6210,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,good to use low to the ground not good for high angles use a fisheye if your getting this have fun,21,60
6211,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,this is a great little tripod stand the tripod part of it is perfect and the entire thing matches the description that was given my only problem with it is the sort of vice grip part intended to hold the iphone it does work but i find that it grips the phone so incredibly tightly that i fear possibly unnecessarily for the safety of the phone i imagine it will not really hurt it but i worry just a little because the grip is so extreme but the device does work as described,93,61
6212,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,no goodthe first moment there i toch the tripod was broken the price is cheap n the product too not recommend,21,62
6213,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,my iphone snapped popped the holder off i threw this in te garbage inside of five minutes not worth the four bucks,22,63
6214,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,i bought this mini-tripod for my 10-year old son he is really into watching and creating stop-motion videos and he needed to be able to place his itouch in something stable that would hold it steady while he posed objects and snapped pictures he has been absolutely delighted with the functionality of this tripod stand my son is happy so I am happy,63,64
6215,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,this stand was the worst thing i have ever got it toulk forever to get to my house and right when i used it it broke if you are a filmer you should not get this right when i put my ipod on the stand an then the stand bottom part of the stand broke off with the leg so now the bottom part is modified with a camera stand do not get this,73,65
6216,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,the price was cheap and the quality was cheap can not say i expected more have not used it much but i imagine it will break after a dozen uses,28,66
6217,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,i really thought wd b cheaper material used instead the stand is sturdy and durable i really like the look of it as well it is cute and easy to use i have an evo shift and even thou my phone is prob technically too big to use it it still fits and works1,53,67
6218,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,i have a gorilla pod at home but they seem to be very fragile pieces of equipment i love the multi use of the gorilla pod but they are very pricey if you need to replace this tri pod is just as convenient to take and go i throw it in my purse because i never know when I shall need it great for use with my iphone 4s i use it for facetime as well so i do not have to hold my phone the entire conversation a def must buy if looking for a ready to go and useful tri-pod for your iphone,103,68
6219,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,it barely does what has its supposed to do i tried to attach it to my iphone 3 with an otterbox and the top arm pulled out and almost broke off immediately i realize that maybe it is just not for a phone with an otterbox the bottom silver legs pull out but do not lock so any amount of pressure at all sends them telescoping back up into the black legs when all three legs are open it still stands crooked on the desk it is wobbly reeealy lightweight and flimsy it does the job but barely and I am sure it will not be long before it breaks,104,69
6220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,the price is really good and i love this tripod it allows me to take cool pics and vids from my iphone,22,70

6222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,this this is plastic and feels that way it for sure is worth the price and for sure works as expected,21,72
6223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,i used it once and it broke so ridiculously cheap i know you get what you pay for but seriously the plastic arms fell off and the spring inside broke it is in the trash what a waste of time buying a new gorilla pod now,47,73
6224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,i think that is its over all a great product but over all fai it is not the best and it is not the worst,22,74
6225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,this is an ok mini tripod stand it is light weighted which makes it good to travel with also the operations are reasonably easy and the junctions are strong enough to hold camera and iphone in position you can also take the holder off and put a camera on it as the big ones the downside of it is that the quality seems to be not so good easy to find artifacts on the plastic surface and edges of the frame the holder is a little bit too tight barely able to hold an iphone 5 i can not fit my galaxy s ii in considering the price i think it is the product i need at the moment,118,75
6226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,this tripod far exceeds my expectations it is perfectly stable in both portrait and landscape modes and feels solid and well made i was sitting at my desk today with my iphone 4 in this tripod having a skype chat with a friend during lunch I am no slacker everyone who walked by wanted to know where i got it and how much it cost when i told them it was less than four bucks they ordered their own and i just ordered two more as gifts for a couple of friends in short it absolutely works as described and it is under four buck under four bucks,105,76
6227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,this would work well for most i was using this in reference to a guide on how to use an android phone with a dslr in short however there are limitations on the device in general although it does as described there is a limit to the width on theit is plastic so expect it to bend a bit but it definitely still holds it in firmly the model phone i was trying to hold in it was the motorola atrix 2 it is a bit wider phone and barely fits but it fits snug and comfortable i would feel confidant using it in the field the side adjustable part of this mount has a small ratchet mechanism basically just manual pressure holding nothing specific it opens and closes when the atrix is in the mount itself since to expose the usb it has to be a little further past the end of the bottom part of the mount not a big deal but it does not fit 100 regardless of the issues it is a spring hold not screw tighten mount cheap but does the job very well and securely no complaints here for a cheap cell phone tripod,198,77
6228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,i bought this before a trip to sea world so i could actually be in the pics with my family it works fine for under 4,26,78
6229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,i do not know how this mount works because it snapped into two pieces the first time i tried to fit my ipod 5 g into it the table top tripod looked like a cheap toy i tossed the whole mess into the trash and ordered another mount istabilizer that cost three times as much i learned my lesson about bargain products,60,79
6230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,it broke right before i use it i am very upset and frustrated about this product this is one good example of made in china,25,80
6231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,this product got to me on the last day of the estimated delivery date when i got it it was poorly packaged seems like someone had already opened it as for the product itself i personally like it i use it all the time for my ipod touch 5 g however the more i pull on the top piece the more i feel like it is going to break but it has not yet it is sturdy when it is landscaped but not so much when you turn it to portrait you actually have to adjust one of the legs for it to work in portrait mode it automatically falls over otherwise besides that it is a good accessory to have check out [ ] for my full hands-on review,123,81
6232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,for the price this little tripod is great the phone holder comes off the tripod so you can use your device on a tripod of any size the most noticeably lacking feature is a way to take portrait-oriented photos but for the price who cares a fun accessory that is worth the money,51,82
6233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,i searched every camera shop in tampa looking for something that would hold my iphone 5 no one had anything that would work but just a few minutes on amazon found this device and it works great,37,83
6234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,2.0,negative,well i thought it would come like it shows in the picture it falls when i put my phone long ways it holds it well side ways but not long ways,32,84
6235,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,again you get what you pay for cheap simple and functional it holds an iphone 4 iphone 5 android phone and a sony camera with no issue,27,85
6236,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,very fragile construction it seperates easily but if you just want the tripod this is okay it would be nice if i can attach a picture wonderful customer service they will replace the broken one,35,86
6237,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,depending on your tripod / cellphone holder needs thiscould be perfect for you it does what you would expect it to do i have not had thelong so i can not review how long it will last but the tripod and holder were simple enough to use right outside the box as some mentioned if you do not extend the tripod legs to their full length having the tripod hold your phone in certain positions will make it topple over however extending the tripod legs cured that problem and there was no cellphone / camera positioning that caused the unit to lose it is balance because of the way the product is made adjusting the camera to certain angles is either not possible or requires a lot of manipulation whether the phone is being held in an upright or sideways position you will find that you will not be able to tilt the unit back or sideways as much as you may need for certain pictures depending on your intended usage that may be a problem but for me i can work around i purchased two of these tripods and the other tripod / holder listed as case star octopus style portable and adjustable tripod stand holder for iphone cellphone camera and case star cellphone bag-blue and black for about 9 my recommendation would be to spend the extra dollars because the other items gives you a lot more flexibility but for the cost of thisi guess there is not much room to complain,247,87
6238,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,this is the best mini tripod stand holder for iphone for iphone i like it is so cool and mini,21,88
6239,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,this is a handly little tripod for your iphone camera i just do not find a lot of use for it thought i would use it more the price was excellent and it arrived in 7 days,36,89
6240,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,for those that know it is only a mini tripod with the added cell phone holder best part was i now have yet another mini tripod to throw in my bag of tricks coolest part is the phone clip is a standard 1/4 20 screw meaning it attaches to almost any tripod mount the tripod is a little on the cheap side but what do want for the price the clip can hold almost any device ie cell phone or camera we have htc phones and they work just as well as an ipoop in the clip,98,90
6241,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,5.0,positive,I am musician this has been very valuable for recording rehearsal i used to stick my iphone to a window with my car mount to record practice,26,91
6242,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,the tripod seems sturdy enough but only marginally stable i bought this for the holder to use with a real tripod since it was cheaper than other ways to put a camera mount on smart phone work fine,38,92
6243,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,it does what it is supposed to do for a humble price compared to 20 stands i mainly wanted to buy this for recording my computer screen but had a rough time fitting my s3 in the holder the spring for the holder is really tight and just as you think you have it open wide enough it snaps off but does not break you can insert it back in no problem i would not recommend using this outside holding a very expensive piece of equipment as sometimes the legs give out and can tip over or even fall but for my intended use i say it is an okay product,108,93
6244,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,bought this for the iphone 4 and it works really great having used this for about a year and it still has not give up on me even although it was fairly cheap overall a really great product and the seller i got it from came really fast i was amazed,50,94
6245,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,this little thing worked as advertised although i did not really need the mini-tripod part i took it off and put the mount on a full sized tripod worked great but then i made the mistake of leaving it on the top of the tripod and tossing it into the back seat of my car the holder self-destructed but then again for 139 I am just going to buy another in fact i will probably buy more than one just in case in all fairness the unit is well designed but it is made from fragile plastic and you need to treat it with the same care as you would treat the phone it is holding do that and it should last,118,95
6246,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,the case arrived in a plastic package and bubble wrap it is easy to use and very protective however it is very hard to get off,26,0
6247,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,I am writing my review based on the fact that the company replaced my 1st case due to an unusual experience the case works great hopefully i will not have the same problem,31,1
6248,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,1.0,negative,two pieces not a goodalready cracked and in the garbage no real protection for the screen which is very fragile on this phone,25,2
6249,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,when you think at a cell phone store you will pay around 10x this amount for nearly the same product you would be a fool to shop else where,29,3
6250,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,1.0,negative,this case was very inexpensive and lasted about a month the corners started breaking and then a side peice broke thisarrived in a timely fashion but the product was not up to the standard i thought it should be i will not be buying another one,47,4
6251,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,purchased this case about 3 weeks ago it was much nicer than i expected feels good to touch looks good on phone but i do agree with the other review it attracts dirt but what can u hope for it is a white case highly recommened great value,47,5
6252,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,1.0,negative,the plastic feel flimsy when the 2 piece case is snapped on the phone it does not feel secure the plastic is slippery and not soft the case does not block any of the ports speakers or camera i was expecting bouncy ball material what i got is green army guy material after tax and shipping the maximum i would pay for this istem is 3,68,6
6253,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,1.0,negative,if i could give this zero stars i would the case leaves just enough room around the phone to allow dirt in the case and the phone can shift back and forth inside the case so the dirt that got in is now scratching the bezel of the phone additionally after a week of use the white coating is coming off the case seems to attract dirt and you can not get it clean afterwards do not buy,77,7
6254,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,2.0,negative,the case came after 3 weeks and a corner of it was messed up so it does not snap together good i like the cover just would of liked it if the corner was not messed up and it came like that somehow it got nessed up a bit,49,8
6255,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,well it fits fine my husband likes it he said it has a good grip to it and it helps the phone from getting harmed,25,9
6256,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,the kid next door brought it but within 6 months broke phone but case never broke i would recommend this case,21,10
6257,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,snaps together and stays together neat and sleek looking textured enough not to slide around not at all bulky but still gives adequate protection,24,11
6258,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,ordered thisand received it in a timely manner unfortunately the product had a tiny almost imperceptible chip in one corner which prevented in from clicking into place i emailed the company and they sent me out another immediately i was very happy to receive the new one today i looks great i ordered it for my mom so have to wait to see her to put it on her phone but i have high marks for this sellers response time thanks,83,12
6259,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,4.0,positive,the case arrived on time and works well for what it is worth it is definitely worth the money it is my secondto buy,26,13
6260,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,i love how it feels it reminds me of a body glove case but it way better than that brand i bought a body glove case for twenty dollars and it broke within two days this one was so soft but yet hard like it was not rubberized i like it,50,14
6261,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,1.0,negative,this case did not snapped on all the way it was worth the penny i paid glad i did not spend more than a few bucks for it you get what you pay for,33,15
6262,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004YKZPHU,5.0,positive,that was fast i really enjoy this i will recommend this and the vendor as well there has not much to add,21,16
6263,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,i did not receive this product when i ordered it for the 1st time when i contacted the seller they sent me the protector again this is a pack of 2 screen protectors the screen protector had scratches when we looked at it carefully on opening and there was a sticker reading peel it here this sticker did not come out easily and gives a sticky appearance at the screen corner not worth buying she shall out some money and buy a good screen protector,84,0
6264,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,5.0,positive,greatjust like they describe fit like you say would recommend to anyone who is looking for a screen protector for their 101 tablet,25,1
6265,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,thiswas shipped in bubble wrap packaging which was great took me a bit to put this thing on instructions were not very clear and i still have bubbles in it but overall this screen protector does it is job,39,2
6266,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,as with many people I have done lots of these screen protectors so I shall cut to the chase here as of the date i bought these these films were just slightly too large none of them could be installed without trimming i did end up trimming about 2 mm off the long bottomand rounding those two corners and getting a reasonable install albeit not perfect moreover the films are high-gloss which look fabulous until you touch them they not only show fingerprints they cling to them which means that after using your tab for five minutes your screen is covered with fingerprints to my estimates about three times as bad as the screen alone with no film and that became too much for me to handle i ended up pulling it off and going with a different product that said bluemall is a fantastic seller and takes good care of their customers so buy from them with confidence I have bought many sold by bluemall items on amazon and their service is fabulous it is just this particular product that i have issue with,185,3
6267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,is durable and can be cleaned but dust flies to it once dry so you need to apply it right away i had trouble getting all the bubbles out and am usually pretty good at it it looks good when the tablet is on but when off you can see the covering overall it works great for the cheap price upate i cleaned the sheet again after a few days and let it air dry then moved to a room where the air was settled to apply this time it worked great and i got most of the bubbles out,100,4
6268,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,does exactly what they say it will do cover your screen and protect it it is very clear and works great,21,5
6269,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,3.0,neutral,it is bigger than the tablet so i had to cut it quit dificcult to do it nex time i will not buy nothing from them,24,6
6270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,it worked great the hole for taking pictures was not quite big enough a leather punch took care of that,20,7

6275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,3.0,neutral,it was way too big for the tab 2 101 and it was very hard to install i ended up buying another one from else where because this on was not that great great price for a not so great product,40,12

6279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,the stickers 2 on the protector could not come off completely rendering the protector to be useless and it also does not stick to the screen surface,27,16

6281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,shipping was desent did not take long at all but when i recieved the product i was not impressed the packaging was bad and the screen protecter it is self was pinched in two places so when i put it on u can see the creases created by the pinch i was not happy with product will not buy again,57,18
6282,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,the screen saver was larger than the screen and covered the speakers we had to modify it to fit also only sent one so if there was an issue you would be paying for nothing,35,19
6283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,this cover is not the right dimensions covers the speakers on the side and dies not cover top camera properly you get what you pay for and return would cost more than purchase do not recommend,36,20

6285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,the fit really is not quite right it was a bit too long and covered the speakers a properly fitting protector should leave the speakers exposed we initially installed ours upside down so i can not speak to other issues such as bubbles and more,42,22
6286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,the first thing i noticed wrong was that the 10 screen protetor did not fit my tablet big size have to cut it little bit no good covered speaker,29,23
6287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,5.0,positive,this is the very good product for it is cost perfectly fits to my samsung galaxy tab 101 real good purchase very happy with it i got perfect screen protector for gt-p7510 with very low price thanks for the great product i whould recommend this product for tab gt-p7510,48,24
6288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,this product is awful first of all they sent me screen protectors that were too small second two of them had pull tabs on the same side rendering the product useless lastly when i tried to see if it would fit there were bubbles everywhere if you try to push them to the edges the screen gets scratched,58,25
6289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,they were exactly as they were described the fact that they swivel is nice i am actually going to order more because i lost these too,26,0

6292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,they come apart too quickly and will not stay on,9,3
6293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,these were inexpensive replacements for the earloop that came with mine and my wifes jawbones they work at least as well as the originals and for me even a little better the earphone has a ball joint just as the originals had to allow you to customize the fit to your ear,52,4
6294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,exactly what i needed for my jawbone bluetooth got another brand before but the clip was too large for the ear piece and kept coming loose this was the perfect replacement for my other jawbone ear clip that came with my bluetooth packaging was secure thanks for a great product,50,5
6295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,they do not swivel like the original ones did and quickly broke i had to put super glue on them so i could continue using them,25,6
6296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,yes i ordered 2 sets glad i did because one broke the first day but having extras i was safe and the jawbone blue tooth is no good without the ear piece,32,7
6297,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,this is a truly inferior product both ear hooks broke with the first 2 days of use completely unusable and should not be bought by anyone wanting more than 1 days use a complete ripoff,35,8
6298,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,the plastic this manufacturer uses is too brittle both my earloop hooks broke within hours of using them one cracked on the partial circle that snaps around the bluetooth and the other will not stay together at the ball joint they fit on my jawbone icon which was my main concern when ordering so they would have what i need except the quality in manufacturing is very poor i would look at other manufacturers,74,9
6299,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,not good wasted my money they both broke within a week of receiving them this is one time i should of listen to previous post they where to flimsy the clip would not stay on the bluetooth e,39,10

6301,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these broke after only a few minutes of use i do not recommend several reviews mentioned this i should have listened i recommend buying directly from jawbone the original clip that came with my era lasted over a year it is a shame i lost it,45,12
6302,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these break within a few uses had to send replacement to husband away on a business trip he has gone through 5 in the last 2 weeks,27,13
6303,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,will not stay on bluetooth too loose to keep it from falling out of my ear,15,14

6306,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,does not work nearly as well as the original comes off all the time of the ear piece but better than nothing,21,17
6307,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,the only problem is they are too loose from the bluetooth,11,18
6308,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,purchased my jawbone icon bluetooth and just in case the earloop broke i decided to get these for my husband and i they are sturdy and feel better having made this purchase,32,19
6309,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,these clips are as handy as they are easy to leave somewhere unintended the units i received performed every bit as well as the original perhaps better,27,20
6310,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,keeps falling off my jawbone bluetooth better to get oem which is what i did that stays on pretty well you can see the difference in performance even although they look identical,32,21
6311,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,for the price the product is good the mfg price was very high works well on my ear piece would recommend it to anyone,25,22
6312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with these i lost the original that came with the jawbone and while these look the same they do not stay on well at all it usually pops off when i try to put this on my ear and can not remove it without it coming off i would not order these again since they will not last they need to attach better,64,23
6313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,my wife has small ears and likes the fit with her jawbone icon quality seems as good as the original that was lost,23,24
6314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,harder to use than my previous one i could not tell from picture that they were stationary no swivel and do not fit well not worth the return shipping price to return will keep as an emergency spare,37,25
6315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,help me to deal with my bluetooth much easily to answer calls when driving i used to have different ones but did not like at all because i have problems to placed on ear,33,26
6316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,very dissappointed in quality clip that attaches to the ear piece is not tight enough and constantly comes off the ear piece when taking on or off,27,27
6317,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,too small and will not stay attached to the earphone you get what you pay for i would not buy them again,22,28
6318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the loops are not deep enough to stay on the jawbone it is always pulling away from the jawbone i am always afraid they will fall off and i will not know it,32,29
6319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the movable joint is very loose it does not stay in position this is not the same as the original that came with the bluetooth shipping however was great,29,30
6320,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,there good on my jawbone for a little while but i did find a better one a little stronger not so pron to braking,24,31
6321,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,i thought these would be more the like oem product they are a different type of material and fall off the ear bud often they work,27,32
6322,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the round clip is not strong enough to stay on the earpiece all the time it comes off every time i try to adjust the earpiece on my ear,29,33
6323,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,i only wish jawbone had made these more substantial and adjustable as i have small ears I have lost 3 of these so far and sure do wish the price was lower,31,34
6324,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,waste of time this junk jawbones initial design causes the need for these in the first place which is required to keep the device on ear they fall off easily and are often lost then you get this cheap plastic junk which does the same thing will never buy a jawbone product again and recommend against it,57,35
6325,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,i do not know why but these do not stay on the headset it is difficult to get them to not fall off when you put the headset into your ear and they almost always come off when you remove it they are small and can easily be lost if dropped on the ground outside i had to superglue one on my headset for it to be useful at all,67,36
6326,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these do not seem to fit my jawbone correctly looks correct but fails to stay clipped on device when placed in pocket,21,37
6327,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,where the original hook was secure these are fairly loose and do not want to securely attach it is better then nothing barely,20,38
6328,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the ear loops attached to the device however sometimes falls off it does not fit tightly to keep on your ear,20,39
6329,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,do not stay hooked on earpiece well come off so easily are easily lost very disappointed in this especially considering the cost of the jawbone in the first place,30,40
6330,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,quick shipping inexpensive but loose fit previous reviewer made same comment so i was warned i have a jawbone icon perhaps it fits oithers better too loose to properly hold earpiece in place,33,41
6331,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,earloops were a serviceable replacement for the original icon jawbone earloop that i lost although these loops have the same tendency to disconnect from the bluetooth on removal from the ear if you are careful it does not happen that often by comparison an earloop fromn the actual jawbone website will cost 3 times as much for a single earloop than what i paid for a pair from the amazon vendor,69,42
6332,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the hook falls off the earbud too easily if you place the earloops hooks and the earbud in your shirt pocket pants pocket or purse it can easily seperate otherwise it works well,33,43
6333,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,they are cheap like the original that came with the jawbone but feels like an exact replacement fits well and swivels just above the hook which some of the others on amazon do not has the same tendency to fall off,40,44
6334,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the part that attaches to the ear set is too loose in comparison to the original ear hook that comes with the device,23,45
6335,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,really great just like new ones that cane with bluetoothjust as comfortable as the ones that came with blue tooth when it was brand new tried to order from where i bought bluetooth but was told they were not avalable just think you can find anything on amazon,48,46
6336,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,when you need a more secure fit these are a must have for keeping the headset from falling off your ear i do not use these very often since i like to take the headset on and off each time i use the phone if you prefer to have the headset on for extended periods of time you will want to have these they are a perfect match with the oem loops that came with my headset and you need spares as they disconnect from the headpiece and are easy to loose,91,47
6337,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it is a great cover for the price a wee bit lose but works if you like sparkle this is the one,22,0
6338,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,i ordered this case on monday and it arrived today wednesday the case is true to the photo it does feel a bit rough because of it is glittery texture my only con is that the case does not cover the top or front of the phone from the front view you can not tell there is even a case on i dislike this for both reasons 1 i want to protect my iphone 4 from scratches and 2 i was hoping I had be able to enjoy the pretty case from the front as well i was pleasantly surprised that the case is lined in a type of padding that protects case from scratching up the phone overall so far so good I shall post an update in a few weeks time to see how durable the case is,136,1
6339,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,bought this for my white iphone 4s from verizon this was one of the best ones i recieved as i ordered 4 different ones the opening on the sides do not hit the side buttons like others did they look soooo feminine the sparkles do not come off it adds such a great look to the phone I am very pleased,59,2
6340,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,the case is perfect for me and looks nice on my white iphone 4s i have no complaints as of yet so feminine,23,3
6341,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,i ordered the white sparkles hardcase for my wifes iphone 4 at t and it snaps on very easily and protects the sides and back of the phone pretty well initially some of the sparkles would come off in your hand but that is to be expected after a couple of days of use i have not noticed any on her or on my hands when i handle the phone i have the sony ipod alarm clockdeal and it charges in that without having to remove the case the only problem i notice on a lot of iphone cases is that there is usually not enough room left around the earphone jack for a standard rca y adapter 35 mm to rca usually the neck on the 35 mm earphone side is too large you will need to get one where the 35 mm neck is the size of the earphone plug or purchase a standard rca to 35 mm adapter and a 35 mm pigtail to plug it into if you are looking to add a little bling to your phone these cases will surely do it and you really can not beat the price,189,4
6342,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,very cute and sparkly case just as i had hoped it is fairly rough although the little sequins and glitter are starting to come off I have only had it for about two days i use my phone a lot so i guess that is to be expected for the price i would like it if these cases covered the whole phone and not just the back overall i would recommend it,71,5

6371,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,unsure if this is normal but the case scratches me and scratches the surface that it is slid on so i guess it is a cheap case,25,34
6372,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,you get what you pay for it is shotty craftsmanship the edges are peeling up and bunchy like they took a sticker and just haphazardly folded it around a plain phone case also it is very very scratchy the sequin / sparkly things are constantly falling off but it does go on easily stays on for the most part and does not look awful i would be more disappointed if i spent more than a dollar on it ha,76,35

6448,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,the case came fast and looks like the picture the edges are already having the putty like substance coming off the edges so it is down to the plastic,29,111

6450,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,it is very nice and pretty if you put it in and out of your pocket some of the sparkles come off but still ok,25,113
6451,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,the glitter is a fine silver glitter not holographic i wanted a super sparkly silver glitter that reflected everyof the rainbow this one will not have that some effect so i gave it away it fit fine,39,114
6452,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,how would i know it still has not arrived yet i will take the time to re-rate when the case finally arrives,22,115
6453,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,you get what you pay for it was poor quality flimsy and i actually threw them away nothing positive i can say about this,23,116
6454,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,it is great for the price you buy it at but it takes a month to get to you and even tho it fits great the feel is rough and makes it hard to push buttons,35,117
6455,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,my daughter couldny wait for her case to come in and when it finally showed up she was sssoooo excited she had it,24,118
6456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,canvas that the glitter is painted on came apart almost immediately great case to have for a week or two you definitely get what you pay for,27,119
6457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,i like lots of cases-kinda fun to switch-er-up anyways this is cute sparkley and looks decent can not beat the price,20,120

6461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,this case was exactly what i expected from looking at the pictures it is a thin case that is not for people that want protection for their phone it is a cheap / affordable case and the sparkles do not come off seriously they do not,39,124
6462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,it was sopposed to be in white but i got it in a sparkly gren and it was hideous sparkles are already falling,23,125
6463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it was a good case some of the sparklers came off but that is about it overall good case for the price,21,126
6464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,nice hard plastic the sequence is more durable than i expected i am order another case because i prefer a front cover to go along with a back cover well made product,32,127
6465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it is less than 2 dollars you are barely paying for the materials at that this is a great case for that price i have not used it extensively but it is held up so far the part i do not love is the edging on the front part it seems to be made out of a cheap plastic the takes to every dent not too noticeable although I had recommend it for the price,69,128
6466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it is super cute defenitly a case just for look and to make ur phone pretty after a while the glitter kinda starts to ware but for a buck something you can not expect much more,34,129
6467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,this phone case is so cute and everytime it is on my phone i get compliments on it i recommend it,20,130
6468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,i thought it would be really sparkly with diamonds and it is just glitter the worst part of this case was that when i tried taking a picture with the back camera at night it came out blue and fogged it up it is awful do not get it,46,131
6469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,i am really enjoying my new sparkles case it is cute and it has protected my iphone when it is dropped I am very satisfied,23,132
6470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,this case is super cute and sturdy for anyone who likes to change up the look of their phone it is a great way to do so super affordable and easy to put in and take off,36,133
6471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,i was not happy at all i have spent a lot of money and i feel I have been ripped off,20,134
6472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,i love this case a lot it is one of my favorites and for one dollar it is really amazing i want to buy more colors i love this case and it is so easy to put on and take right off,42,135
6473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,hi this phone case is pretty i like this phone case do you my name is i like theblue,22,136
6474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,aq so this one was just bad it was poorly made it was not even the sides had spots there where bigger and spots the where smaller and the sparkles did not go all the way around it did not cover the corners i looked like it was used for a long time before i got it and it was a new one i would say to get it,66,137
6475,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,the finishing touch is not so smooth and polished as seen on picture it also leaves sparkles all over your hand once you are done using your phone it also leaves sparkles everywhere else i put my phone,38,138
6476,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,i love this case it does not slip in my hand it sparkles in sunlight and is fun to look at,21,139
6477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,i ordered this case because it looked cute and sparkly but when i got it the edges looked like they were mealted and cheep looking,25,140
6478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,case does not cover the front at all it is a fairly thick cover i like it for the price I am very happy,23,141
6479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,i truly enjoy this case i purchased it knowing it was going to look awesum on my phone it is a greatand love the bling,25,142
6480,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,it fits my phone perfectly which believe it or not can be hard to find in some cases the biggest plus is i do not have to break a nail trying to take it off when switching cases,37,143
6481,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it is good fits fine i was expecting the cover to have stones not a glitter type texture the glitter does not go all over the place but if picked at or played with much a piece or two will come off other than that shipping took a bit of a while but i was in no rush to have it and the price was great,65,144
6482,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,it is pretty but feels weird and the little sequins start to lift up and look feel awkward i guess it is all part of the experience although not everything is sleek these days,32,145
6483,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,recieved thewith in the time frame they said it would come and was pleased with the case only thing is the glitter falls off easily,27,146
6484,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,the silver sparkly phone case i purchased was very cheaply made granted i know how much i paid for it but on the front where the cover attaches onto the phone is really big and bulky i bought other ones and there is a plastic cover on the front so it looks more sleek i also think i got it cheaper than the other one,65,147
6485,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,i like almost everything about this case it snaps on and off the phone easily and makes the phone look pretty only thing is that the opening for the camera seems to cover it a bit when using flash and the sparkles come off alot which is very annoying otherwise it is a very stylish case,56,148
6486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,the case is cute but very cheap of course in the first hour my hands and clothing were covered in silver glitter i did not use it long because of this and how cheap it feels i gave it 2 stars only because it is a cute case,47,149
6487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,it is a cute case but i got the wrongin the mail the sparkles have starting coming off after only 2 days of it being on my phone i do not carry a purse either so it is not like it is being tossed around i carry it in my pocket or hand and it definitely is not a case to have if you are looking for any kind of protection made of cheap plastic with no padding what-so-ever it does look like the photo although if you receive the correctand fit my iphone 4 perfectly definitely only designed for looks although i still gave it 3 stars because you get what you pay for and i paid less than 2 so what can you expect,127,150
6488,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,it looks good but like the oic 100 it is more flat and glittering alot ib real but it is fine and elegant,22,151
6489,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,the case is a much thicker plastic than i thought it would be for the price however it does not have a lip that comes over to the front of the phone so if you drop your phone it is likely that the screen might break the case is overall exactly what i thought it would be veryyy sparkly and shinny it looks great and i have received many compliments the surfrace is a little scratchy but nothing that is worth not buying it over the first few days i had a few glitter specks on my hand which was to be expected but it did not alter the appearance of the case overall this is a great case however if you tend to drop your phone i would not recommend it,131,152
6490,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,thelooked nice for a day or two because all the sparkles came off but you can not expect much when you buy something cheap all i can say is if you want something nice and cheap this is not it unless you only need it for a couple of days,51,153
6491,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,my phone case came faster than the anticipated date which was great it looks exactly like the picture it is just a little loose and occasionally falls off of my iphone,30,154
6492,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,this phone case is terrible all my sparkles fell off and the case did not protect my phone it is completely shattered in the back i would not recommend this to any one,32,155
6493,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,i bought this case and got it on time i used it for about a month and then a pice broke and made the case useless looking for a short term hand candy phone case get it,37,156
6494,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,love this case it is a little scratchy but it does not bother me i would reccomend that if your putting your phone down on your bed or something make sure to put it screen down that way your sheets do not pull at the case however the one problem i had was the front of the case has a little dent in it but i would reccomend this especially for a white iphone,72,157
6495,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,the phone cover did not hold my iphone 4 very tightly it felt like it was going to slip out of the cover and the cover would not have protected my phone if i would have dropped it or if it would have fallen,44,158
6496,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,this cover is super cute but i have had it for a month and glitter still falls off and the cover is falling a part it also does not fit correctly on the top left corner it is definitely worth it is price,40,159
6497,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,this phone cover was poorly constructed the sparkles come off in your hands then you see white blank spots looks pretty although if you do not mind losing sparkles in the process,31,160
6498,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,i was very excited when i saw this case and bought it right away upon arrival i was very dissapointed with this product all it was was a bunch of gray glitter slathered on a very poor made case the case edges look like a bunch of sloppy glue let to dry and the area around the camera is not molded to fit at all the picture shows a perfectly shaped case with almost flat fabric like sequins and that is not at all what you get not to mention the mess of the glitter not cool and regret buying this product very much the thing i was most unsatisfied with is that in the picture it is looks iridescent and it is not it is dark gray with somesprinkles,128,161
6499,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,i like the case very much and received numerous compliments but i wish it would be more protective of the phone,21,162
6500,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,i was really excited for this case because i wanted to add sparkle to my phone the case is made from a very cheap material and only covers the back of the phone the case did not fit on the left hand side at the top either it felt like it would have fallen off really easily if i had dropped it this case does not provide any protection for the front of the phone either i like cases that come up over the sides and a little on the front so you get a good fit and this one did not fit the bill if you are looking for just sparkle with no protection than this case would work but if you need a case that will protect your phone when it is dropped look for a different case,138,163
6501,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,5.0,positive,awesome product for the price cautious at first but after dropping my phone twice i would recommend to anyone plus it is cute,23,164
6502,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,it is an okay case but it only covers the back and while the product title includes the words sparkles it is not very sparkly even it direct sun but it is still a shiny silver case which is pretty in it is own right being that it was not sparkly nor having a front piece it really was not what i was looking for and the title misled me but it still is an okay cover not a case for the price,78,165
6503,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,the quality is cheap and the sparkles constantly keep falling off not worth it no matter how cheap it is,20,166
6504,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,3.0,neutral,the plastic is pretty thick i was expecting thinner flimsier plastic for this price but the downside is that it makes for a harder time putting on / taking off the case i have a verizon iphone 4 and it fit my phone with no problems no covered-up buttons no covered ports and more I am disappointed in the scratchy texture although the glitter / sparkle on the back definitely feels very rough and sandpaper-like and when i took the case on a test drive this afternoon it drove me crazy the way it would snag on fabric and the way it felt whenever i handled my phone i also agree with a couple other reviewers who mentioned that the lack of sparkle on the part of the case toward the front makes it look weird you have got a back that is like bling bang bam and the front looks really plain and strange especially on the black iphone which i have it might not look too bad on a white one although overall the sparkle is really fun and looks awesome when the light hits it but because of the texture i do not think I shall be using it for an everyday cover,196,167
6505,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,i was excited to get this case especially after reading the positive reviews however I am very dissatisfied with the case it does not cover the top of the iphone and from the front you can barely tell there has a case because it just looks clear my biggest complaint is that the sparkles come off of the back of the case i noticed sparkles falling the second i put the case on my iphone and at this point there are white patches on the back where sparkles used to be it looks pretty bad also the case is really rough feeling if it rubs against your skin say you slip the phone in your waistband it is very uncomfortable not recommended,118,168
6506,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,not so happy cheaply made and the glitter falls off alot and it only covers the back so the front looks very bare,23,169
6549,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,5.0,positive,ok first off if you are thinking about getting this do it now listen why package arrived a day early everything intact and packed really nice box that the actual charger came in was all written in chinese but hey it is pretty simple to figure it out the charger charges a completely dead battery in 2 hours and they last longer than my samsung battery I have been on the phone now for 2 hours and 39 minutes and i checked the battery and it is at 51 the charger also has a nifty usb port on the bottom and lights that show how much charge the battery has red when it is empty and fades to purple then blue when it is done very impressive for the price now go buy one,128,0
6550,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,4.0,positive,ok the batteries are fine i am disappointed that i can not charge them while they are in the phone the phone actually goes off and the battery will not charge strange no actually ridiculous so i have a decent couple of batteries a charger and i will not purchase thisever again i have a samsung captivate,60,1
6551,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,1.0,negative,after seeing the other review i thought it would not hurt to try it for the price i am also an epic 4 g user heres what i found the hyperion battery will only charge on the wall charger not when inserted into your phone and you try to use your regular cable it is like the phone does not recognize this battery the charging icon flashes red the 2nd flaw is that after charging the hyperion overnight i stuck it into my bag for a day trip only to find that it lost it is charge as the day went on so when i needed to use it it had no charge i am going to stop by sprint and get a real genuine battery as a backup you get what you pay for i guess so disapointed,136,2
6552,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,1.0,negative,i got the 2 batteries and wall charger the first thing i noticed is my wall charger does not work properly you have to prop something against it to get it to even work one battery charges on the charger and the other will not take a charge on the charger also neither battery will charge while in my phone the t-mobile 4 g,62,3
6553,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,1.0,negative,product description clearly states that it will charge in all phones other than the fascinate this is not the case with either battery shipped with the unit mine simply read error and will not charge to it is benefit they do charge in the provided charger since this means you have to cart the charger thing around with you everywhere adding to the amount of junk one is required to haul around it can only be classified as a fail in short product description is incorrect it does not charge in the samsung epic 4 g,94,4
6554,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,5.0,positive,these are a great deal for the money i now never worry about my phone dying what a blessing thanks so much,21,5
6555,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,5.0,positive,i feel bad that i left a bad review before i received an email from the company letting me know that they will replace my product they really do care about their customers satisfaction never had a fast response like that before the batteries do charge in my phone and hold a nice charge will update again when i receive the new charger,63,6
6556,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,2.0,negative,these batteries are only holding a charge for a day but i was wanting to get back to the 2 - 3 days between charges i had with the original samsung battery i am not a heavy user of my phone keep the wi-fi bluetooth and gps off most of the time and only have 200 mb data plan so not much internet i thought having 2 batteries would be good but found swapping them out daily became a chore I am going to write off this purchase to experience and spend the money for a samsung battery,94,7
6557,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,1.0,negative,this product is really bad the 2 batterys that come discharge more than four times faster than the original samsung battery of my focus wp75 the original battery would be charged about 2 days of simple 3 g web browsing but this one can only do the same for about half day,51,8
6558,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,1.0,negative,it broke after 1 day contacts on charger are worthless save your money and grief hopefully better products are released soon,21,9
6559,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,4.0,positive,i like to refer to these as my netflix batteries i use them when watching movies or for extended gaming sessions they will not charge in the phone only on the provided charger having two extra batteries definitely relieves the stress of worrying if your phone will die on you before you can get to a charger they last about as long as the stock battery and charge in about the same time as well,75,10
6560,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,2.0,negative,these batteries hold a charge for maybe 10 hrs 1 year old samsung battery just over a day they fit the charger is reasonable but the batteries are useless,29,11
6561,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,5.0,positive,these batteries work great in my samsung epic 4 g i never have to worry about my phone dying and can use the phones features to thier maximum i can even leave my phone in 4 g more now without worrying about having a back up battery on hand batteries seem to last as long as the oem battery,57,12
6562,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,4.0,positive,I have been using the hyperion battery on my samsung captivate for about a month now without even realizing it i switched it sometime back in early august just to see how it works and obviously it works just as well as my samsung battery did because i just found my samsung battery laying on my desk when i thought it was in my phone the people complaining how bad the battery life is do not understand how smartphones work this is not your nokia 2780 with the green and black screen you do more than play snake on your phone this uses a lot of processor power and uses more juice i can easily go a whole day with moderate to moderately-high use and my wifi on the whole time and still have a bit of power left i can not comment on the charger since i was sent one that did not even fit the batteries which is where the star was lost my rating pros two batteries for less than 1/2 of what one single samsung replacement would cost seem to be built pretty well so far they have held their charge well i will try to update again in another month to see if the charge is still holding well cons none so far i have a feeling I shall get a new phone before i ever need to order batteries again,230,13
6563,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,5.0,positive,i am using this battery for a samsung focus that is running on windows 7 which is an excellent phone the battery life is equivalent to the battery that came with my phone one will last me all day unless i use the phone as a gps but now i have a backup battery if i want to do that i was concerned that the batteries may not charge in my phone but they do charge in my phone without a problem so i do not have to pull the back off my phone to replace the battery to charge in the external charger if i do want to use the external charger it charges the battery faster than doing it in the phone in about 2 hours overall this is an excellent value two batteries and a charger for 20,141,14
6564,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054Z8YPE,2.0,negative,there is nothing wrong with the charger but that is not the reason for purchasing this set the bsatteries do not even lat half a day and the only saving grace is that i can not carry a second one around to change when that happens the batteries which is what i really wanted were to replace or be used in addition to the original oem battery that came with my galaxy s my method of use for the phone has always been the same bluetooth on auto-rotate on no silent / vibrate for the most part as that drains batteries quickly email accounts refreshing every minute no more than 30min of talk / day and more initially and for the first few months the samsung oem battery would last me up to a day and a half and eventually that got reduced to a full day but that was fine as it went on the charger overnight as expected after 500 charges the battery started dying off by early evening prompting me to source new batteries these not only last less than that but also because th phone to die off suddenly after it has gone into yellow mode rather than a gradual shutdown reduction of brightness and more that the oem battery still affords me maybe these are just refurbs from returned or decomissioned phones rather than new batteries will purchase another oem one for 20 to get what i wanted,237,15
6565,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,great case as far as fit and finish mine came with a slight imperfection on the side but not worth the trouble of exchanging seems solid and durable nice soft touch highly recommended and i am very picky with my cases,41,0
6566,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,had this case for 3 days and the kickback broke do not buy this case not worth the money at allll,21,1
6567,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,this is a nice and solid iphone case it fits my iphone 4 perfectly and i really like the kickstand only complaint i have is that the kickstand looks metal in the photos but it is actually made of plastic and feels like it will break easily with much use the case itself however feels sturdy and protects my iphone well,61,2
6568,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,I am very happy with this new case for my iphone 4 g the product is exactly the same as it is described by the seller very light and beautiful i like it a lot and i will definitely recommend this case to everyone,42,3
6569,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,I have tried own several different cases since buying my iphone 4 last year for the money this one by far is my favorite it is not I shall fitting or heavy whether in a belt holster or pants pocket it is easy to carry and feels as solid as the phone itself it looks and feels nice to handle and the built in kickstand is an added bonus for watching videos or using other apps in landscape mode,75,4
6570,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,the case fits great and does not add bulk to my pocket this case also stands on it is side so i can use it for you tube videos,27,5
6571,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,it def looks a lot better on amazon feels and looks kind cheap but for the price what do you expect,21,6

6573,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,the stand just a piece of plastic on a hinge but it serves it is purpose especially considering the price tag on thisthe case itself can be hard to snap together or was for me at least so do not plan on using it if you are going to be taking it on and off frequently that being said it is a wonderful compact case that serves it is purpose,68,8
6574,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,awful case made of cheap plastic that snapped while i was putting it on the kickstand is a little piece of plastic that is glued to the back do not buy this case mine was in the trash in minutes,38,9
6575,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,this case was excellent for the price and was very solid it did interfere with the screen cover however on the rim i felt my phone was safe and protected in this case,33,10
6576,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,it is not worth it does not do what it is intended to do i would return it but not worth the postage they got me,25,11
6577,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,this case was good but the little kickstand to watch movies on it was really difficult to pop out i think i broke my nail every time i tried to use it not bad for price,36,12
6578,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,this is a decent cover for the price i paid the kickstand broke off the second day i had the cover but you get what you pay for other than that it protects the phone fine and the charger fits without having to remove it,45,13
6579,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,this is a useless product made of cheap plastic the kick stand never came out and is just a bad product,21,14

6581,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,do not wast your money this kickstand case only allows yoy one way to stand your phone up which covers the volume after 2 days of use case started pealing this plastic celophane type material,34,16
6582,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,actually the fact that the stand is out of plastic but looks like shiny metal is excellent i read other reviews of how the metal interferes with reception i had metal cases too and while they looked nice they messed up the voice reception on the phone had it for 6 months now beautiful case compact and sleek with a rim around the screen so the screen is protected it really looks costly and even nicer than some of the very expensive ones out there i say buy no brainer I am back to buy the white one,99,17
6583,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,the case itself is made well i would say i feel my phone is protected well i love the stand it works well i bought it because i constantly watch netflix on my phone i am a little afraid every time i stand up my phone that the stand is going to break but it has not yet the plastic does not seem like it can hold the weight of the phone but I am not going to doubt it just yet,79,18
6584,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,the case works fine looks fine and seems to protect the phone for the most part but when i took it off to switch cases i found that i scratched my iphone alot the whole metal platting around the iphone is sctrached for this the case gets only 1 star a case should protect your phone not ruin it,59,19
6585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,love the case but can not charge with a standard iphone wall charger it will not fit between the case edges,20,20
6586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,it is nice but it is cheap plastic when i first got it i almost pulled off the silver-looking kick stand it will work as a case if you need something like that just be wary,33,21
6587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,overall this was a good case kickstand feature was incredible and very useful although within a few days the coating on the cover began to peel and it looked like I had had it for years by the time the first week was over i had to buy a regular non exciting speck case to replace it i kept the case for plane rides and trips you can not go wrong for the price but you get what you pay for,79,22
6588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,this product never ever came i was so disappointed because i thought this case was very sharp and professional as i type no case still,25,23
6589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,nice solid case nice kickstand just does not stay on when you have aux cord in fits me perfect it is or maybe i need a skinny aux cord,27,24
6590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,this cover is the most practical of covers protects is easy to hold onto even for smaller hands and is posionable for watching or listening,24,25
6591,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,2.0,negative,thearrived in good condition but after a few days of use the satin coating on the black plastic started to peel off at the edges as i slid the phone in a nd out of my pocket now after just one month this looks like a very old and ruggedly usedwhen all it has gotten in gentle handling this is a very bad product for it is coating although i still like the kickstand feature if i can find the kickstand feature with a better finished product this one is history i just wish the coating was a lot more durable if you like carrying around an iphone with peeling coating like a snake shedding it is skin then this product is for you,126,26
6592,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,nice case for iphone especially for the price only reason i did not rate it a five star is because of the flimsy plastic stand that comes with it not the sellers fault i rate the seller a five great place to shop and do business with i highly recommend buying from this seller,54,27
6593,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,I am very please with this case i have an iphone 4s it came just as advertised works great very sturdy love the kickstand while browsing the web viewing video / tv delivery was just as promised i put it together easily and within minutes i went to the apple store to find a case and they were 3000 5000 what and they were half the case as this protect your 300 phone with this sturdy functional iphone 4s case love it,76,28
6594,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,it is a very bulky case and the stand is not that sturdy it did interfere with my phone signal so i had to buy a new case after only using it for a day i would not recommend this case,39,29
6595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,2.0,negative,bought this case for my nephews new iphone and it is a tad bit cheapy looking i would not buy it,20,30
6596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,nice product and does exactly as described protects the phone and allows access to all buttons speakers microphone and cameras i have the 4gs the finish is not the best it appears to be chipping like paint does after only two weeks so do not expect it to be pretty although they did try with the chrome and apple window the kickstand works but is apparently delicate,67,31
6597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,falling apart after a few days looks like crap after 1 week you get what you pay for keep looking,20,32
6598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,plastic kickstand is tough to open and broke 2nd time used spend more on a kickstand that is made from a stronger material other then that the case is fine,30,33
6599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,this case is a solid build with the exception of the kickstand i have not intentionally or not dropped my phone but i am confident that it will protect it from most impact i paid less than 9 from empire accessories which goes by cnc imports llc with amazon for that amount i feel like i came away with nice product it comes with a screen guard as well i would give it a five out of five but like most people already pointed out the kickstand is flimsy handle that with care because the kickstand and the price was a deal maker for me upon purchase this is a one month update it is true about the peeling so as long as you know you are getting 9 quality but i still stand firm on protection at least the phone fits snug and i feel secure that it will resist most falls on impact,154,34
6600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,great cover nice fit no gaps good feel two piece snap together design protects iphone 4s without a lot of bulk,21,35
6601,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,this case it s awsome it work very well no matter that the stand it s plastic and no metal like i thought before i order and them read the reviews the only thong i do not give five star is because it result a king of hard to fit to my iphone 4s i although that it going to scrath but it is not it fit very welll and work nice,70,36
6602,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,i like the way this case looks i like thecontrast the black with the chromeand the window in the back that highlights the apple logo the case has a soft feel and fits the iphone 4 perfectly the chrome kickstand is made of plastic but a nice chromei wish that mine would have been made of metal but it serves it is purpose as a kickstand i would not rely on the kickstand lasting very long the case will protect your iphone but I had be afraid if i dropped my phone in this case it seems to protect the sides but the front of the phone is not protected right now I am using this case on my phone and i carry this case in a leather pouch that i used for my blackberry overall this is a great starter case and amazon sells it for a really good price but I am buying another case so that my iphone will be protected all around,167,37
6603,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,i bought this case during cyber monday so i thought that explained the huge price drop marked down from 49 in truth this is just a cheap knock off case that looks good in pictures only the construction is flimsy the kickstand is a slight breeze away from snapping off and when you put the case on you phone you lose 2 bars of reception for 9 bucks it is not worth the effort to return then darn thing but please do not think you are getting a 49 quality case this is straight off canal street junk avoid,99,38
6604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,this case was just what i was looking for it is sleek and professional in appearance i woul recommend this case,21,39
6605,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,at first glance the case is very sharp looking even feels nice in your hand decent fit and finish 2 piece snap on case that fits well together no squeaks and keeps phone secure the chrome look stand and logo hole are plastic and scratch very easily and the stand is super flimsy I am very careful with mine and i believe that is the only reason it has not snapped off yet if that piece was better made and the chrome was more durable I had give it 5 stars,87,40
6606,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,i bought this case for my sprint iphone 4s i spent about two days researching cases and finally settled on this one for two reasons one it looked good which it does look great on the phone and two it looked like it would provide decent protection for not just the back but also the front of the phone with the raised lip on the cover so the screen actually has a bumper the kickstand was just an added bonus that i thought would be cool on an other why has great looking case the kickstand does work but when i first got it i thought i was going to break it off after having it for about 4 days now the kickstand is still intact and i have gotten use to how to carefully use the kickstand when i want it overall it is a great case with a great price while i was at the sprint store they were selling complete garbage not even close to being as nice as this one for 25 - 35 dollars i would recommend this case and would by another one even if the kickstand breaks off this one,193,41
6607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,great quality for the any price it fits well and allows easy operation also prevents accidental button pushing as well i really like it a lot do not fret buy it rest are way over priced,34,42
6608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,i ordered this case for my new iphone 4 and i have been completely satisified ever since the product is made of sturdy materials and it has a nice kickstand on the back that is made of chrome i have dropped my phone several times since i purchased the case and it protected my iphone i am completely satisifed with the performance of this phone case,66,43
6641,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,5.0,positive,exactly what i was looking for colors are perfect works and fits well only problem I have had is if i let the battery get too low it will not come on to let me sign off and i have to take the cover off i can live with that,48,0
6642,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,5.0,positive,fits my phone perfectly it is a uniqueand i enjoy being able to keep my phone looking new and scratch free thanks,24,1
6643,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,1.0,negative,this phone case is very pretty very colorful and vibrant which is what led me to buy it however the case blocks the sensor on the phone that allows the phone to light up when the phone is taken away from your face to allow you to hang up or browse the phone in order to unblock the sensor the phone case has to be taken off the top of the phone do not buy this case i suggest going to buy another phone case from this seller because they are great and have rapid shipping do not waste your time and please look past the nice colors of this case,110,2
6644,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,4.0,positive,it is no otter box but it is also more than half the price and works just fine the rubber sleeve fits nicely around the phone and then you must follow it with the hard casing enough to help keep the phone protected from moderate falls no screen protection although get an otterbox for that,53,3
6645,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,i was so looking forward to getting this case i love the look and the feel of it however it is not functional the case covers the proximity sensor so it always thinks you have the phone pressed against your ear and turns off the display nothing will get the display back except taking it out of the case i am very disappointed,63,4
6646,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,the case is nice enought but my daughter started complaining that her screen would not come back on after a call it seems that the case interferes with a sensor when a call ends and the screen will not come back on until you take the case off we liked the case when we got it especially my daughter because it has both her favorite colors pretty dissapointed that we had the trouble and are now searching for a different case,80,5
6647,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,4.0,positive,the case came earlier than i expected the colors were very bright and i really like how it fits the phone,21,6
6648,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,first the pros are theand the durability the case is bright and colorful it is also good with my son who tears everything up however if you are looking for something that is going to be functional this is not it the holes do not match up so you have to force the charger in the sensors for when you are on the phone do not work with the case and the self portraits have the case in the picture i would not recommend unless you just want a pretty case,90,7
6649,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,5.0,positive,accept no substitutes the hard plastic 2 piece cases are flimsy and break easily the more durable oneusually gray or black are better but boring this is what you want the soft rubber glove is a perfect fit and protects your phone front side and back thecoordinated hard rubber back completes the package it all fits so snug i did not realize it was 2 separate pieces for a few days it feels good in your hand and matches the buttons and ports on the phone exactly the only drawback is that the phone no longer fits into the original belt clip you need the xxl pouch style leather belt clip which is what i prefer anyway,120,8
6650,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,3.0,neutral,the rubber part of the case stretched with time therefore the hard plastic started to fit strangely around the rubber case the rubber also easily caught in your pants pocket when taking your phone out of your pocket,38,9
6651,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,theis wonderful but the button on the right side that turns the screen off keeps turning my screen off in the middle of a call or conversation i have to take the phone completely out of the case to get it working again so i do not use this case anymore,53,10

6655,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,1.0,negative,purchased this for my wifes samsung infuse 4 g fit is poor at best the holes in the silicone sleeve do not line up correctly and block the charge port mike and earphone ports also the hard plastic back fits poorly to the point of falling off the phone complete waste of money and time,54,14
6656,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,4.0,positive,nice case but i had to remove it to charge my phone i loved thecombination and it is pretty sturdy,22,15
6657,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,3.0,neutral,the green rubber part slides over speaker holes and off the lower half of phone if it would stay put this case would be a five star other than that it does protect the phone,35,16
6658,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,3.0,neutral,i have the same problem with the blue green that i had with the white gray case in fact i have found i can get the caseless phone out of my pocket a lot more easly than with the case,40,17

6668,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,3.0,neutral,bought it for my daughter who drops her phone on occasion thought it might help protect it it did protect it but it cracks easily near camera lens it will not last long also it covers the talk speaker but still works okay,42,27
6669,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,4.0,positive,the only this is i thought it had a front cover for the phone screen part but all in all i like it,23,28
6670,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,3.0,neutral,it was cheap and it protects my phone really well but it is a hassle making calls and having to slip the case on and off,25,29

6674,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,the case does not fit on the phone correctly part of the case covers up the phone sensors and the phone will not light back up until you take the case off i ended up just cutting the piece of the case with scissors so that it would not affect the sensors overall i was not satisfied due to the fact that the case does not fit all the way and the two components do not fit with each other as well as i thought they would,85,33
6675,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,the case has okay protection but the case covers part of you camera and when your on a call the screen stays black until you take the case off when you take the case on and off a lot the thin piece of plastic breaks right away i would not suggest this case to anyone,54,34
6676,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,1.0,negative,it was exactly what i wanted thewas as vibrant as i expected and seemingly fit great well the product is flawed the rubber blocks the sleep censor which gave me all kind of problems i actually took my new phone back to att thinking i had a defective product turned out to be my new favorite case damn,60,35

6679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,1.0,negative,we purchased this cover for our daughters samsung infuse phone and she can not hang up calls because the cover does not let the sensor through so she has to take it out of the case each time would not recommend this cover,41,38

6696,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,great fit and sound but buttons stopped functioning after 2 weeks making the unit useless,15,16
6697,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,i have been using these in the gym 3 days / wk for the last six weeks i wipe them dry and put them away after esch use yesterday they just quit i charged them and tried again nothing the red charge light indicates charging and charged can not turn them on and nothing will function,53,17
6698,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,it is better than expected holds pretty well on the head looked for quite a while for this type of wireless over-the-head headset after i was disappointed with many flimsy ones that hang free off the ears and never quite hold tight as promised the sound quality is not perfect but good enough for exercise both outdoor and gym would not use it for airplane or chilling out on the couch the only major disappointment is battery ideally they should have used the top area of the arc and place additional fitted battery to increase the time also the materials are not top notch but good investment for the money overall,111,18
6699,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,i have had three sets of these all have failed after a week of use while working out need to seal the product against moisture perspiration as the saying goes and i do not sweat a lot for a fat guy using them for 30 min while on the elliptical or the treadmill inside not running a marathon at quantico outside,57,19
6700,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,this is actually a nice fitting headset has a great tone also wears very nicely however after a few workouts it shorted and stopped working i felt that the work out moisture was the because i do not recommend it for work out but for just general hearing use it would be a decent product,54,20
6701,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,3.0,neutral,could certainly extend a little longer as somewhat uncomfortable / tight fitting otherwise is good with decent sound,16,21
6702,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,died on me in less than 3 months,8,22
6703,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,this is a great set of headphones the sound is far better than any buds I have tried and it is not diminished with sweat while i run the fact that they fold up makes them extremely handy to take when travelling,41,23
6704,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,i used it for 6 weeks and the battery will not charge anymore now i have to figure out if there is a way to replace from azeca,27,24
6705,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,this is the second pair of these headphones i have bought i still use the first pair sold as scosche hz-8 and bought this pair as a spare and for the very handy case the configuration of the speakers directs the sound to my ear canals rather than against my ear as with many earphones the pair is lightweight and if adjusted correctly they are very comfortable to wear i detest headphones with wires and found these to pair easily with my computers or iphone and ipad,87,25
6706,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,great running headphones i have used bluetooth running headphones for years and these have to be the best they are comfortable and easy to use and loud for running outside and overall retain a good charge and deliver many hours of music before recharging the real test for these is if they are working past 9 months as no pair i have ever owned last more than 9 months of daily usage,72,26
6707,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,i really like this headset light weight decent audio quality recharges via usb one small problem there seem to be a bit of a manufacturing control issue on the ear pieces theof the earpieces is fairly sharp plastic it dug into my ear and became very uncomfortable a minute or so with an emery board fixed it,60,27
6708,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,3.0,neutral,the sound is good on this headset i bought to use while working out and running I have not had any of the issues other purchasers have listed with the exception of it making my ear canal sensitive if i wear it for long periods of time i use it at work to listen to music and walk around my office and away from my phone without any issues i would recommend this device and would buy another one i have an update to my review 3/11/14 i am finally able to run outside and unfortunately the other reviews I have read about it not working well if in a running belt are correct it is like you are listening to a skipping record if i take my phone out of the belt and carry it it is better I am not sure why motion effects the headset but my next try will be to put my phone in an armband so for now I am reducing my review star from a 4 to a 3,169,28
6709,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,i took a chance based on the reviews i wanted a headband style bluetooth headset i could wear running they were great for about 4 runs now they will not turn on anymore there are several others that commented with the same issue too bad because i liked them but looks like I shall have to try another brand,57,29
6710,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,it fits good on my ears and i can hear very well with it just keep it away from water,20,30
6711,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,I have had a pair of wired vertical in ear head phones for over 10 years so when they finally died i wanted to cut the wire and enjoy more freedom i absolutely love the size volume quality of calls and fit the unit itself looks very durable and well made the first 30 days of using this headset was great and i was giving them a 5 out of 5 during the second 30 days switching between music and calls became sporadic and turning the unit on was taking increasingly longer today I am less than 90 days in and it took close to 5 minutes to turn the unit on it is getting frustrating since I am never sure how long or if the unit will turn on so I am now looking for a better made headset arg,136,31
6712,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,i expected a better link between the headset and my phone but far from that when I am listening music gaps and mutes continiusly happend,24,32
6713,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,good sound and range with good fit being able to fold into travel case is great feature good companion to ipod touch,22,33
6714,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,fits snug and sounds good really like that it came with a durable case and i love the wireless connection very clear,22,34
6715,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,for the price they are excellent sound is very good and large wireless range matter of fact i forgot my iphone at a tread mill wondering across the gym to another machine before i realized it i really enjoy the no wires while working out and listening to music and movies on my ipad while on an airplane the only issue was there was a plastic bur around the ear bud left by manufacturing i took an emery board and lightly sanded down the roughand all is good not to mention if i did not like them amazons return policy is too generous making it very easy to shop with no concerns i happen to be listening to pink floyds animals while typing this review,126,35
6716,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,i have been through two sets love love love them but they will not last the manufacturer replaced my first set and working on my next but it just will not hold up to sweat my first one the ear piece went out and the second one the volume is messed up it is lightweight and i have been using the second one for at least five months sweating every morning but it finally toasted it it is hard to find a good wireless set out there that will hold up,88,36
6717,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,the sound is very bad quality it takes several hours to recharge short range of coverage about 2 m which is not enough of your working in the area around,30,37
6718,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,i would not recommend buying these headphones for someone looking to use them while working out or jogging they are not sweat resistant and after 3 - 5 uses they stopped working and the battery would no longer charge i exchanged the first set thinking it was just a one-off defect but the replacement set also stopped working after about 5 workouts as such i called it quits and returned the 2nd set for a refund i was disappointed that these did not work as the sound quality was very decent and the wireless technology provided a lot of flexibility while working out at the gym bottom line i would avoid these until the technology is improved,115,38
6719,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,first day was great then i could not get it to charge and then i could not get it to link to my galaxy iii next a piece of thebroke off and it is been doa ever since pure and utter crap there is something to be said for you get what you pay for,54,39
6720,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,i previously went through three motorola sd-9 and 10 bluetooth headphones the 9 version rusted out after seven months of intense sweating the two 10 are still in decent shape although the button on one no longer responds as reliably this product is not as sturdy or high quality in material as a motorola but it pairs without a problem it is louder than my motorolas and the buttons are quite accessible the hard plastic earpieces are not comfortable for long term wear still for the money i can not complain i primarily use it to listen to music or news while working at the gym,105,40
6721,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,a small piece fell off of these headphones after i first used them it did not affect anything so i kept them the second time i used them the same piece fell off of the other side again the headphones worked so i thought they were fine i was never rough with them and always placed them in their case afterwards well now a screw has somehow come out and i can not use them at all save yourself the time and spend a little more money for something better i know i will,92,41
6722,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,i bought these but i am now returning them i opened the package and looked at the headphones and knew the in ear piece was much too large for my ears the in ear piece is about 3/4 tall i do have small ears but they are much larger than any over the head in ear headphones i have seen,60,42
6723,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,i used the product during an indoor workout on the elliptical in the middle of the first workout the product quit working and will no longer take a charge upon review of the instructions it says to keep the product away from moisture the fact of the matter the product can not tolerate any moisture and it will likely crash and die when it gets even a small amount of moisture if you plan to use this when you might sweat make another selection,82,43
6724,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,initially i enjoyed the product they are light weight easy to pair and seemed to be holding battery power for about an hour based on the reviews i did not expect too much more than an hour out of them however after a few weeks the batterys abilities faded fast it pretty much got to the point that in order to to get anywhere near 45 minutes out of them i had to charge them immediatley before use if you expect to charge them thursday night and use them saturday morning do not expect more than maybe 20 - 30 mins at this rate i am guessing within a few months they will not even hold a charge,113,44
6725,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,3.0,neutral,not very durable worked fairly well for a short period first the plastic cracked on both sides where the adjustment / slider goes taped that and moved on then it totally died while i was using it can not get any audio out of it anymore even although it connects save your money try something else,53,45
6726,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,3.0,neutral,these almost fit the bill i want bluetooth that does a few simple things 1 they do not cut out with the bluetooth signal 2 they have good sound 3 they stay on the head while working out 4 they are comfy these are ok on all but number 4 they put this effort into a good set of headphones yet use hard plastic earbuds that kill the ears do they even try the products they design if they only used a in the eary soft bud these would be great this is my sixth pair of bluetooth headphones i must return this is getting ridiculous any suggestions update within a day of posting a this review the manufacturer replied to me stating they have foam inserts that they would glady sent me even although i did decline the offer this shows wonderful customer support,144,46
6727,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,very good sound even a little bass good battery life all the audio playing functions work well used it quite a lot just to talk on the phone sensitive microphone not a complaint just works best in a more quiet atmosphere but no one ever has a hard time hearing me no one ever even realizes I am using headphones I am impressed great product,63,47
6728,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,i really liked this headset and wanted to give it a 5 star but they do not hold up to heavy sweating very comfortable fit and on a scale of 1 - 10 the sound quality was a 7 it could use a little more volume battery life was so so i went through 2 pairs of these and each one failed after 3 work outs i am speculating it was sweat that got them they would just quit working sometime they would start working again after a few days but were very intermittent after the first failure if they had held up to the sweat i would be using them now if you are not a heavy sweater then they may work fine for you i have been using the jaybird jf3 mb freedom bluetooth buds for over 2 months now and they have not failed me yet and their sound quality is a 10 on a scale of 1 - 10,156,48
6729,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,I had been generally happy with my motorola sd-h9 bluetooth headset but was attracted to how this unit folded up into a hard case that part is fine what has not been fine is how the sound varies every time i put them on based on how it is fitting into my ears sometimes the sound is fine sometimes it is muffled and i have not yet found any way of getting that to be consistently good most bluetooth headsets have some options that allow adjustment in fit but that is not true for this unit it may work very well for some but unfortunately not for me,102,49
6730,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,i originally purchased this headset for running with my droid 3 it pairs up easily but does not work well out in the wild i get constant intermittent drop outs especially around traffic lights i just purchased an asus transformer 3 which is great and figured i could use the headsets with it nope i get an invalid passcode error when i try to pair it i can not find any manuals online or anything helpful at all from the manufacturer would be great to have some support apparently you can email the company for the manuals why it is not just available on their website,103,50
6731,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,a complete waste of money the broke on the first usage made of very cheap plastic and very uncomfortable in a few minutes they hurts your ears will never again buy anything from this brand,35,51
6732,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,1.0,negative,this product worked great out of the box i am a runner and they were the perfect solution to ditch the wires sound quality was as expected for bluetooth they were light weight and volume / music controls worked great with my iphone 4s however they only worked for two runs then went completely dead they will not respond to a charge make sure to keep your packaging and receipt i would not buy from this manufacturer again or recommend this product,80,52
6774,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,i love my samsung galaxy s2 phone which proved to be the perfect companion to my samsung galaxy tablet this screen protector fits the phone perfectly and protects the touch screen android face as advertised you will not go wrong with this purchase,42,0
6775,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,2.0,negative,i used this screen cover for a week before removing it in any type of bright light it was very hard to see the screen and when outside in natural light it was impossible to see the screen at all the cover did fit the phone perfect so if you do like the mirror cover it would be perfect for you,61,1
6776,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,the mirror feature kills any chance of seeing the screen when there is background lighting the protector also cuts down on the screen brightness too much the size is smaller than the screen leaving a 1mmall around the perfect place for dust to collect on the positive side it is cheap so it was worth the try i would not recommend it although,65,2
6777,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,i like the screen protector because it provides a mirror but if you are in the sun you can forget about seeing the screen that is the only con i have about this it does not peel it is very secure,37,3
6778,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,i must say i was a bit worried when i ordered this case because of this phone being sold with different carriers people are ordering the wrong versions of the screen protector but this one is amazing i am very happy it was easy to apply and if done right only takes a couple of minutes it fits perfectly with the t-mobile version of the samsung galaxy sii no need to cut or anything i love that i can see myself instead of having to look into the mirror this screen protector is a girls best friend it does not get smudgy and can be wiped off i would def recommend this product to others,114,4
6779,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,threw it out to difficult to see screen,8,5
6780,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,it smudge easily the otha one i had did not do dat but other than seeing through it as a mirror it is ok,22,6
6781,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,it is to dark to c through but coolfor a screen guard although just wished u could c through it,22,7
6782,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,loved having this on my phone it was the best mirror and always handy but at times extremely hard to see through especially if you are outside you might as well not use your phone,35,8
6783,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,i loved it there really was not much more to say about the product it worked just as I had hoped,21,9
6784,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,i think it is cute u can can see yourself in them very well but after my daughter had it for a while she asked i could get her a different kind because the mirror was distracting and she had to press buttons more than normal with it on and u can not see it clear enough for her i used her phone it was ok to me although,67,10
6785,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,its perfect for a personal mirror it is perfect for any galaxy phone it is clear a mirror for every ocasion,21,11
6786,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,the screen protector was good but eventually i got tired of it so i took it off also the screen did not feel smooth like regular protectors and it made the screen a little darker than i care for,38,12
6787,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,the mirror went on very easily it is thicker than a typical screen protector the mirror is very clear and not blurry so as far as the mirror goes it is an excellentgreat for fixing up your makeup checking to see if there is something in your teeth or eye greathowever two things that i notice that may be problematic for other people are that the mirror tends to muck up a bit easier than my old screen protector and it is really difficult to use while outside when it is sunny indoors when the screen is lit up you can see through the mirror just fine but you will still see the mirror image over it but it acts as good glass so others can not look over your shoulder and read text messages,137,13
6788,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,it did not fit the phone i do not know why the screen protector was smaller than the phone and,20,14
6789,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,i will give it 1 stars because the product is okay if it had a no star i would give it that for not having a warning that usage should be limited to dusk night time only i am thankful that i at least lived to regret getting this and not thinking twice when i purchased this product i would not recommend this unless you are going to use it in low light / night only your phone will be a mirror only when you are out in natural day light it does not let you see the dial pad i could not dial 911 without peeling this off the phone which was not easy because my phone had one of those covers that have the double case and this was underneath when you are in an accident you do not have time waste,136,15
6790,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,got this for my daughter and she loves them too flashy for me she loves them she is asking me for more so i will have to purchase more soo,30,16

6792,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,this screen protector is great the only fault i have is using my phone outdoors you can hardly see the screen at times other than that it is perfect,28,18
6793,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,it is a ok product for the price but when trying to look at your phone in any kind of light you can not see anything i guess that is the purpose but i do not like it but it is a great mirror for when i want to check myself out,46,19
6794,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,i have no use for thissince my genius husband broke and cracked my display and digitizer on my sg2 totally sux no phone,25,20

6796,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,far shipping no problems with seller it is just that the product is useless outdoors the mirror effect reflects all natural light to the point where i can not see my screen,30,22
6797,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,do not get i ordered almost two months ago and i have not recived i have tried tracking and calling in to report but no feedback on either side i am still trying to get money or product,38,23

6802,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,i just got it today fast shipping pros 1 these covers fit the phone great 2 i love the way that it protects my screen on my phone thank you again so much cons 1 on sunlight it is impossible to see anything in phone but i know everything before placing an order so i know what I am buying,57,28

6805,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,fits my tmobile galaxy s2 perfectly and it was the easiest cover to keep air bubbles out of that I have ever put on it really does look like a mirror when the screen is locked the only pitfall to it is depending on the lighting of where you are the items on the screen can look hologram-ish i also noticed that if you try to take a self-portrait using the forward camera this cover can because a halo effect around the edges of the photo it is a thick sturdy cover although,91,31
6806,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,I am happy with this screen protector it is clear like the cristal and relly it is a mirror it is the best that I have found to protect and enjoy movies and pictures in my cell phone no doubt to buy it satisfaction garantized,40,32

6808,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,2.0,negative,if you like a reflective finish you may like this product i however do not and it does not adhere to the phone as it is suppose to,28,34
6809,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,i got this screen for my wife and she loved it it does exactly what it is supposed to it reflects as a mirror when the screen is locked and blacked out and when you awaken your phone you can see the screen clearly the only bother is that it is harsh in the sun obviously because the screen protector still reflects so ocasionally you well get sun in your eyes,70,35
6810,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,this screen protector is really crappy the shipping took forever and it came slightly bended and scratched up it scratches very easy i was upset that i wanted to return it but it is petty so really do not buy it it is terrible the only nice touch is the mirror gio,49,36

6814,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,when outside can not see anything on the screen overall the product keeps the screen protected but the quality is poor,21,40
6815,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,fits the phone perfectly and provides a nice mirrored finish great price for thisand very easy to apply to the phone,24,41

6819,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,it does what it was designed to do but it did not work for me when outside i was usually unable to see the screen due to sunlight reflection,29,45
6820,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,it is a great deal it is a great product it does what it says it does i did not like it bc i could not see my screen when i was outside in the sun,33,46
6821,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,i love this guy this is the perfect accessory for a place like los angeles where looking good is almost as essential as having a cell phone this really does turn your samsung into a makeshift mirror in a pinch I have used it to put on eyeliner touch up makeup gaze at myself when bored obsess over a budding pimple and more the great thing is even although you may effectively be walking down the street staring into a hand mirror no one has to be the wiser that is no-one on the street needs to know you are secretly engrossed in your appearance to the casual observer you are simply engrossed in your phone maybe watching a video or reading a text message for people more concerned with things like using your phone fear not this protector is pretty seamless as well I have never had problems with the touchscreen not registering and more i noted other reviews talking about scratches and durability but I have had this for a while and nothings really scratched it does pick up fingerprints like mad but I had rather the prints be on the protector than the actual screen itself that is what you are buying a protector for right i took off one star because the glare can make it difficult to see the screen in bright light still works great as a mirror although that being said the daylight glare issue is a relative curse affecting nearly every smartphone even without the protector i would still have that problem but i do believe the reflective quality of the mirror accentuates the glare hence the star knock-off I had still highly recommend this product for those who dream of transforming their phones into a trusty pocket mirror do not be shy you know who you are,297,47
6822,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,the screensaver works great in all places except where this is a lot of sun do not buy if you go to the beach a lot because you will not be able to see a damn thing other than that it works great and it is nice and thick and does it is job,50,48
6823,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,I am always looking at the mirror so i would make sense that i get an mirror base screen protect awesome product came on time and i have zero complains,29,49
6824,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,i loved it on my phone but in sun light it is hard to see screen so took it off my phone,23,50
6825,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,i like it but really i want exactly look picture in amazon website when i received it it look dieffent a little bit the cut on top for speaker too wide it can t protect full my screen phone however it is ok,43,51
6826,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,2.0,negative,theof the mirror screen seemed like a cool thing to have but once i placed it on my phone shacking my head i was not able to see my screen myvees were killing took it off threw it away,36,52
6827,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,this screen protector is very bad too much glare and it is got some type of pattern on it not clear mirror i used it for a few days took it off and threw it away it is really bad,38,53
6828,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,i like it i thought it would be a little thicker in it is width but it serves it serves tje purpose for what i bought it for,27,54
6829,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,this product is very glossy and with the mirrow effect it is hard to see in the sunshine i had to remove mine and feel it was a waste of money and hope no one buys one unless you only use it inside or have small children who tend to put finger marks on your phone very dissatified with thisa loyal customer,63,55
6830,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,1.0,negative,this product was cool at first because it had a nice mirror and made my phone look unique but after awhile the screen protector just kept getting scratched up just by putting it in my jeans pocket the tiny scratches were very noticeable and it smudges up a lot just by touching it after having for about two weeks i just threw it away not wanting to look at it anymore the screen protector became so ugly disappointing the only good things were that the bubbles were not as noticeable and that it does do it is job by protecting the screen,101,56
6831,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,once on this cover does give the appearance of a mirror you have to be very careful when placing on the screen to avoid air bubbles screen must be absolutely free of dust,33,57
6832,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,this is not the best screen protector I have had but for what i paid it has certainly done the job i think if i were a meticulous person it would bother me there are a few tiny bubbles that just could not be avoided with multiple attempts at applying it otherwise it has not bugged me enough to get a different one it is very solid and durable,66,58
6833,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,2.0,negative,can not see the screen when it is bright out even if it just little bright whether it is outside or inside it is difficult to c pictures and if I am watching a video or playing a game and it is setting are at night or dark areas i would not be able to see the game or the scene it also leaves the finger marks on the screen so if I am using the pattern to unlock the screen someone could see the marks of my finger on the screen and would be able to know my pattern,92,59
6834,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,i love the product it does bubble up a bit however overall this is really a great product the mirror is excellent,20,60
6835,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,3.0,neutral,i have bought mirror screen protectors but i am not a big fan of them the main reason is because it becomes even harder to read when you are in direct sunlight the protector is just too reflective it is cool to have a mirror but i would recommend getting a clear one so you do not have to sacrifice screen clarity and visibility for a mirror unless you realllly need a mirror on your phone,73,61
6836,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,5.0,positive,the product is overall solid other than it can be difficult to view your screen with the mirrored screen in the sunlight a common issue for this screen but i am overall very satisified with my purchase,36,62
6837,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,2.0,negative,i was upset when i got it in because it had a little bend in it and when i put it on my phone it was really noticeable so i threw it away because it bugged the crap out of me i guess it was done during shipping but still mad,51,63
6838,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,2.0,negative,I am sure it was just a fluke with this one phone but it did not seem like the battery would charge on it,22,0

6840,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,this is the best phone i have had in 4 years two phones i had previously did not last me 6 months i have never had a moments trouble and am considering buying another for another line,36,2
6841,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,this phone sucks it is owned me for a year and I am glad to get rid of it i finally was able to get an upgrade and went with the galaxy 2 skyrocket it is the best phone I have ever owned i suggest you buy that instead and forget you ever saw this thing,52,3

6844,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,unbelievable i dropped this phone in it is case on a dirt road and to my horror watched a full size pick-up truck run over the phone i picked up the phone took it out of the case and to my amazement it was still working i immediately made a call and it worked perfectly i had a screen protector on it and that is a little scratched up but other than that you would never know it was in an accident the case is in rougher shape tire tracks and dents / scratches from the dirt road but it cost less than 10 so i will not mind replacing that,107,6
6845,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,the charger port was broken it would not charge so i had to charge it thru the old phone in order to charge the battery,24,7
6846,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,3.0,neutral,i was super excited to see people selling this particular phone on amazon this was my first official non-tracphone and i got it for my freshman year of college it worked perfectly for me and i had it for about 4 years before i started experiencing problems with it it seemed like a cord was disconnected or something because it works while closed but stops working when i flip it up this was fine i just taped it shut but then i could not text or call numbers i did not already have in my contacts i read reviews about this phone and there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the charging part of it but i decided getting the phone i was familiar with was worth the risk long story short i ordered this phone was super excited that it was new and still in it is box and put my old sim card in it this new phone does not charge the batteries i have used the charger it came with and 2 of my other chargers and it just does not charge it says it is charging but as soon as i unplug it it goes back to low batterie it is not the end of the world although i have been switching out the batteries and charging them with my old phone and then putting them back into the new one it is a bit of a hassle especially for long phone calls but it is worth it too me to have the phone i want i am sure when this one dies or i get sick of it i will probably upgrade to a better phone but for now i am happy with it,292,8
6847,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,4.0,positive,good phone slipped the att sim card and off it went no complaints great reception for voice calls typing is easy text messaging a breeze smart phone nope great call quality and competent texting phone definitely do the math and take into account the att 3600 activation when you get that free upgrade which includes a new 2 year contract at the higher subsidized monthly rate before you have to sharpen your pencil you will realize this phone paid for itself in under 3 months do not hesitate to recommend it highly if this is what you are in the market for,100,9
6848,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,2.0,negative,like this model of phone but we had this particular phone a short while when it stopped charging correctly now it will charge sometimes and sometimes it will not of course it was too late to send it back at that point ordered a new one from a different site so we will see how that goes,56,10
6849,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,these are our second round of these phones they are easy to use do great on battery life text internet talk but you do not have the ridiculous bill like a smart phone each phone last about 3 years as our primary phones will buy again when the current ones die,49,11
6850,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,3.0,neutral,the problem with this phone is the battery does not hold a charge always keep it as fully charged as possible,20,12
6851,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,3.0,neutral,phone works fine as long as you keep the battery almost fully charged all the time or it will just quit on you for this reason i bought another battery,30,13
6852,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,i bought this phone to replace my wifes other samsung strive that finally gave out after almost 3 years we were happy to find this phone still available for purchase it was sold as new but we had problems with it the very first day within minutes of turning it on it shut off and we could not get it to turn back on we let it charge overnight and the battery showed a full charge but in less than an hour the battery was dead we tried another battery same thing we tried a different charging cord in a different location the phone just would not allow the battery to charge or hold a charge then the phone shut off and we could not get it to turn back on at all we returned it i do not believe this phone was new but possibly refurbished i was very disappointed with this purchase,150,14

6871,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,the shooting star case came and it was perfect until i realized that there was not a cut out compartment for the on / off button at the top of my iphone i had to take a knife and cut it out myself also there is not a volume compartment so you have to feel around to higher or lower your volume i love the design and texture of it but the compartment is a big no no,74,2

6877,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,does not have cut outs for the volume and lock button i am not very happy about that minor issue,20,8
6878,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,5.0,positive,surprisingly this protected my iphone 3gs pretty well for a less than 4 case the only thing is that thestarted coming off within less a month again it was a less than 4 case so I am not even mad about it i even got another one,49,9

6881,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,this came rather quickly and was extremely cheap however there was no opening for the volume buttons or the on / off button making it quite useless in my opinion,28,12

6890,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,the case i got looks similar but not the same on the picture it is hard to get the case on the phone and there is a button on the top of the phone to turn off the phone it is covered up have to take the case off in order to restart phone,54,21
6891,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,this case was promoted for use with the iphone 3gs however it does not have the cutouts for the volume button on the side of the phone or the lock button in the top right corner the material is very firm so it is difficult to try to operate these functions through the phone case i cut a hole in the top of the case to access the lock screen button but the case looks strange with the make shift hole cut in the top i would not recommend this case for the 3gs,92,22
6892,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,it took three months to get here and then the casing started to peel off within 3 days of having it not worth it,24,23
6893,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,i loved the cover as soon as i opened the package it is a very nice cover but not until i went to lock my phone did i realize that there was not a hole for the lock button nor is there a hole for your volume button so good quality but not user friendly not sure what i will do about the holes i am going to email the company and see if there is anything they can do,80,24
6894,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,i like the look but it was difficult to use because some of the components were covered rendering them un-useable,20,25
6895,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,i loved the look of the case but it does not really protect the phone it is a very flimsy cheap plasticy rubber,21,26
6896,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,5.0,positive,i love my phone cover now i can not get it mixed up with anyone elses i am asked everyday where i got it,23,27
6897,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,the case is okay not bad for the price but does not protect from breakage of screen just covers the she shall of the phone,24,28

6900,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,the product arrive earlier than estimated which was nice the case was pretty but the fitting was a little off on one side of my phone the case came all the way over the side on the other side the case did not even reach all the way around to the front of my phone like the product was mis-shaped and after only a little use maybe a week the design was rubbing off you can tell it is cheaply made,79,31
6901,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,the fit and shape of thewas good however the blackaround the edges of the product rubs off easily,22,32

6903,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,i have an apple 3 g but this case does not really fit it well had to cut the volume opening wider and the top power button price was good but the way it fits is not good,36,34
6904,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,i was so excited to receive this case and when i got it the packaging had chinese writing on it that should have been my first clue cheaply made in hong kong this case only lasted for about 2 weeks until the paint started to peel off not really worth the purchase,52,35
6905,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,i was disapointed with this product i opened the package put it on my phone and wiped my hand across it and it started to peel i guess it is true you get what you pay for,36,36
6906,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,unable to use the case as there is no hole access for the on / off switch on the iphone3 which makes the case difficult to use,24,37
6907,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,the case is not what i expected it is a hard non flexible material i thought a gel case would be the same as a silicone case but it is not at all,31,38
6908,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,this did not meet my expectations unfortunately the description of thewas not correct this did not fit my iphone 3 so i can not use it it is very pretty and i would have liked to show it off instead the company refunded my money,45,39
6909,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,there were cut outs on the case that were not cut out therefore uses on my phone were not accessible,20,40

6913,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,this is a cute product but does not fit around the phone properly shows the sides of the phone and does not come around the front a little to protect the glass screen,33,44

6915,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,first i was hoping for a case that would be rubbery and wrap around the front to protect my screen which was already cracked this barely reaches also it smells terrible very chemically strips of it began peeling off immediately and the worst part about it is that it did not have an open section of the case for the power button you can not shut the phone off with this case on there is a hole for the camera and one for headphones and a large one at the bottom for the speakers and more wth sure it was cheap but it is useless,101,46
6916,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,5.0,positive,very pretty and it does not show dirt marks i was forvever cleaning my old case i like the flexible gel too i had the hard case before,27,47

6919,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,this case is adorable and protects the phone very well however thetends to wear off quite quickly and if you are looking for a very high quality case this is probably not the way to go if you change cases often this is a great option although,48,50
6920,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,i really love the way this case looks but the coating begins to scratch off reveling the white underneath and makes it look like crap also it just goes slightly over the top of the phone on the front and provides no protection for the screen it is really just a cute skin for the back more than a protective case i used it for a while but eventually replaced it because of the marks it was still worth the price for me although,83,51
6921,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,i really liked the way this product looked when i got it it is very similar to the picture but theis already rubbing off of it it appears as although it was painted on and easily scrapes off and I have only had the case for about 3 weeks,49,52
6922,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,theon this phone were not as bright as I had like but overall it got the job done keep in mind that flexible gel is not flexible or gel it is more of a smooth-hard material when it comes to it it is cheap and it works,47,53
6923,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,5.0,positive,this phone case is beautiful without being gaudy the colors are bright and really stand out and the case is flexible so it fits the phone like a glove,29,54

6927,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,4.0,positive,it is ok for a cover it is soft and pretty it looks nice on the phone easy to hold,20,58
6928,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,i bought it for around 750 and did not even use it it is very boring cover not at all looks this much impressive as shown in pic trust me it is waste to spend money on this case,35,59
6929,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,very cheaply made i was not happy with this purchase at all it went straight back as soon as i got it the holes in it were badly misplaced including the space for my charger to go in so i would have had to take off my case just to charge my phone where has the sense in that needless to say i will not buy from this seller or get a silicon case for my phone again,75,60
6930,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,i like it so much but unfortunately does not fit my iphone it covers the camera lens so it is not possible to use the camera,26,61
6931,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,i have yet to receive this case in the mail i was suppose to be coming from hong kong so not sure if that is the reason we have to received it,32,62
6932,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,2.0,negative,it is an inexpensive gel case so i was not shocked but the case does not look nearly as good as this it is a bit dull and rubber y if you would,28,63
6933,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,1.0,negative,waste of money did not fit on iphone 3 g blocks camera view and ringer switch on side of phone what a disappointment this should not be advertised for 3 g,29,64
6934,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,the phone case fits well but after 3 days the outer coating started to peel off I have purchased higher quality cases for less money the design is very nice exactly what i expected,33,65
6935,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,5.0,positive,i really love this phone case it is soooo pretty and soooo bright it was in-exspensive and fast shipping i recommend this to anyone with an iphone 3gs,28,66
6936,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,3.0,neutral,the sides of the front of the phone case have all turned white as the design has slowly been scraped off the phone is only ever in my purse and i do not keep anything particularly sharp in my purse either i does not really bother me and the back still looks great but i know it would bother others with this same problem i bought this case in april,68,67
6937,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006AOWQ3O,4.0,positive,when i first got it i was really excited because it was really colorful and fun but i did have a hard time putting it on because it was gel another thing was that after 3 - 4 days it started chipping off like he protecting part of the case the top coat over all i really like it,58,68
6938,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,4.0,positive,while i know that i will hit spots where i do not have a good enough signal to get a decent hotspot going this device works beautifully at the primary location where it will be used features are good operation is easy speed is excellent battery life is much better than i expected and the t-mobile data deals are a great value gave it 4 instead of 5 stars in anticipation of wanting to use it somewhere that i can not get a good signal that has not happened yet,87,0
6939,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,5.0,positive,I am very pleased with the device this device is locked so buyers should be aware of this fact according to t-mobile they will unlock the device after I have spent 100 with them an online unlocking service failed in this task however t-mobiles pay-as-you go data cards are competitively priced so this was not much of an ordeal the device with t-mobiles 4 g lte service in phoenix can be amazingly fast over 20 mbps using an online speed meter highly recommend this device i also discovered the device can be tethered directly to my laptop through an usb port so that i never have to turn on my wifi card,108,1
6940,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,1.0,negative,junk this is the second one that i bought i ruined the first one trying to get a sim card into it additionally it shipped with a full size sim card without any adapters it takes a micro i bought another activation package with a micro sim plus the adapter set and none of the above fit either I am not ruining another one it is hewaded back and I am done I shall just use my iphone as a hotspot,77,2
6941,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,1.0,negative,i thought this hotspot was the sonic 20 where i could get online with my desktop it is the same hotspot i already have i am just having trouble getting the device i need,34,3
6942,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,4.0,positive,works well with a t-mobile sim i use the no-contract plan pay for gb when i need to use it traveling and more controls via display are rather limited dare i say dumbed-down i hand this to my wife when she has going away for a conference so she can connect almost anywhere and we do not have to worry about spoofed ssids at the airport or anywheres,65,4
6943,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,5.0,positive,works great gets me a hotspot in the car for non-drivers of course and access to the internet anywhere there is cell tower coverage,24,5
6944,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,5.0,positive,we just purchased one it took a bit longer to get here but the product works perfect it receives signals every well we fully charged the device the first night after received it the next day after using it for 10 hours it still had half bar left it is just what we expected,54,6
6945,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,2.0,negative,the device serves it is purpose but just barely the main issue is that it is not 4 g speed also the device came with some kind of parental block that i have not been able to remove using the administrator tools i think as an adult i should be able to purchase boxers and briefs from online retailers other than amazon but the device says otherwise because i have to use this thing with a vpn and because the speed is just not what it is supposed to be from t-mobile i am only giving it two stars i will sadly go back to using my at t at t unite mobile no-contract 4 g wifi hotspot at t prepaid because the speed is what it is supposed although i get less data for more,132,7
6946,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,4.0,positive,instructions that came with this were for a blackberry not sure what happened here otherwise actual product was as described,20,8
6947,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,5.0,positive,this was an update for me from an older tmobile hotspot i have had no problems i put my old sim card in and it works like a charm i am very happy with this purchase,36,9
6948,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,2.0,negative,with surprise i read all the reviews i come from germany and stay for 6 month every year in florida i bought this hotspot but i could not use that device with a normal 4 g t-mobile sim-card 80 unlimited 4 g data it works with an special plan for 80 at 5 gb useable for this device and it isno you have to activate the device and card in a t-mobile store there is no online service because the staff connects the card to that device,83,10
6949,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,2.0,negative,i could not get it to work instructions were confusing and there was a registration part that i could not get past,21,11
6950,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,1.0,negative,i had the same problem as the reviewer bluecheetah thearrived incomplete it was returned now I am using my phone as a hotspot which winds up being more cost effective anyway,32,12
6951,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,3.0,neutral,batery does not run to long and you need to conect it all the time,15,13
6952,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006C29NZI,4.0,positive,perfect little device for those who need wifi and have a sim card laying around or an account for data use easy to use right out of the box came in great shape there is also an advanced setting menu for those of us that like a bit more personal settings and security,53,14
6953,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,it seems great in concept but once you clip it onto the vent forget about it when i tried to remove it to move it the clips broke and now it is useless,32,0
6954,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,i loved using this cradle for the phone but it was hard to put on the vent and even harder to make it stay once i did it worked great for about a week but it kept falling apart I am thinking about gluing the thing together and then trying it i like the concept but needs to be more sturdy but for the price I am not complaining,67,1
6955,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,5.0,positive,i ordered 2 at the same time one for me and one for my husband then i ead proir reviews i got a little worried but it holds my phone perfectly as it charges love it,36,2
6956,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,the charger works the vent mount works sure i could pay 5 times as much for a higher quality vent mount that might work better but i do not think it would make a difference this mount grips my phone perfectly to hold it still and nonetheless allow me to slip it in and out it adjusts for just about any phone and it grips with these two little foam pads on each side that probably will not squeez any buttons it has an folding piece in the back that let us you change the angle a bit sure it is a bit loose if you push it up it will dimount because it is made from two pieces and i must admit that while adjusting it i kept making mistakes and endend up breaking one of the clips who cares it still works and i almost feel like i got the charger for free,151,3
6957,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,better than i thought it would be the top clips secured the device on to the air vent there is a part on the bottom of the back that pushes the phone straight up and down the clip on and off part works great but there is a lot of movement if you try to press hard against the screen but overall it is good for the money if it was 30 I had give it 25 stars,76,4
6958,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,a piece of garbage for a car vent mount holder the pieces do not even hold together thank god i did not pay much for it and it was not new although it was advertised as new,34,5
6959,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,this product was ok but not what i expected it is kind of light and it is not strong at all very light can not hold the phone very well however it is will have to due until i find something better mark berry,40,6
6960,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,is ok the actualseems a little cheaply made however it will hold the phone securely through the vent which is really all i need it for i would recomend this product to others especially considering the inexpensive cost,41,7
6961,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,I am quite pleased with my charger and phone holder it keeps the phone intact nicely and the charger is very nice as well,23,8
6962,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,installation was pretty cumbersome because the clamps do not fit well in the vent once i had it installed the phone kept swirling from right to left depending on traffic also i could not rotate the phone high enough to get a good view from the driver seat i got tired of it and wanted to remove it but even that was hard would never buy it again,66,9
6963,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,the charger stopped working on day 2 and the mount sits in the vent so it slids from side to side while you make turns while driving i threw it out,31,10
6964,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,my review is more for the holder than the charger the charger died after couple months but i was not surprised both only cost 7 what can i expect i like the flexibility of the holder it can fit different phones mine and my husbands and i like that i do not need to change the holder now i got a bigger new phone it sits a bit wobbly on the vents but there is a little stand at the bottom to let the whole thing sit on a solid surface below the vent slots when you go over a bump it can move a bit but the phone is stable in the holder the holder allows me to use my phone as navigation and i can see it perfectly while driving,130,11
6965,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,5.0,positive,love it great when traveling long distance the charger stopped working a few months later but i got a new phone by then,23,12

6968,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,pros affordable easy to use easy to install cons depending on the angle and shape of vent the car vent mount may or may not remain intact another negative point is that the car vent holder is not tight when turned from left to right as a result if you take a sharp turn the product will shift the same direction,61,15
6969,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,unit rattles agaist the dashboard when i am drivoing and it get annoying not sure if i will use it or not,22,16

6971,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,this is by far the worsti have ever bought on amazon the charger sucks the vent mount holder sucks it does not hold my phone and to take it out the vents is a hassle it broke my damn vents pulling it out i would never purchase anything like this again or tell anyone to get this,58,18
6972,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,it was a tight fit in my car especially with the charger attached but it does what it says was a bit hard to install without directions to put it together,31,19
6973,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,the holder is very cheaply made but works this the only reason i give three stars because it is usable the charger on the other hand is in the trash can,30,20
6974,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,product was shipped and delivered on time nothin was wrong with products only thing i did not like was there was no instructions for putting the mount holder together,28,21

6981,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,fast shipment bad quality although it broke in like a week that is without me barely touching it or anything definately will not buy again,23,28
6982,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,the car mount broke while placing it and we could not even use it once will never buy it or suggest anybody to buy it the charger seems to be working fine although,32,29
6983,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,5.0,positive,took awhile to get used to function however what a cool holder this is would purchase from this vendor again,20,30
6984,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,the vent mount holder works just fine i still use it but the charger is complete crap it worked for one day and then just completely fell apart inside my cigarette lighter and blew a fuse,36,31
6985,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,this broke the second i got it i guess the price says it all not really a good product I shall pay more next time to get better they say you get what you pay for,35,32
6986,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,cheaply assembled the product was inop from the get go i had to replace the fuse and use superglue to keep the charger from breaking apart after replacing the fuse for the 3rd time i shit canned the whole unit,40,33

6989,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,the only complaint that i have is how it attaches it is hard to get on and if you need to move it well let us just say it would be better to buy another one other than that i love it it works just fine for what i need,48,36
6990,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,the holder does not fit very good on my cars air vent so it falls frequently however the charger is very good,21,37
6991,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,i got this stuff with the basic expectation of using it with my galaxy s2 but it appeared total waste the car charger does not actually charge at all and it has co connection with s-2 it looked just like any card charger like old ones so may be that is why it is not charging and the stand is also use less i hoped to use the stand but it comes in 2 pieces the stand fits into the main piece but after that it is not stable i got this 2 weeks back and could not use it for a minute i travel lot so thought to use it as portable car charger and cell stand i will say big nooooooooooooo spend more and buy usable rather this is junk,131,38
6992,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,works great with the samsung galaxy s-2 and the vent system on the dodge dakota for the 5 price tag you can not go wrong if this unit were to break in the future i would buy it again,38,39
6993,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,the holder worked great but he car charger stopped working after 4 months the indicator led on the charger is annoyingly bright especially for night driving,26,40
6994,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,5.0,positive,i like the fact that the vent mount holder holds the phone very good even on buppy roads and that the side custions will not scratch the phone while it is in place the vent mounts are easy to install and it is also nice that it comes with a charger with it,52,41
6995,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,this product works awesome i really only ordered it for the charger but i ended up loving the docking station even more works perfect in my car and hold my phone up wonderfully,33,42
6996,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,the charger works just fine no complaints will continue to use the mount is pretty pointless it is made of two pieces that very loosely fit together it also loosely sits in your vent it flopped left and right with every turn it also fell out many times this is not just annoying when you are using a gps but dangerous when it falls under your feet this was the most that my phone has ever had a fall the only good thing about it is the open / closing mechanism seems decent and the soft grip held my phone well,99,43
6997,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,i was originally looking for a car charger and a window mount for my phone but when i saw this i brought it thinking it was a perfect deal until i got theand realize it was a air vent mount the air vent mount may work for some cars or for people that never takes it off but lately people are starting to break car windows in my neighborhood if they even think you have a piece of anything that may be related to a gps the air vent mount was cheaply made and too difficult to take off spent an extra 2 bucks and get a window mount,111,44
6998,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,5.0,positive,i love using this product in my truck it is great for handsfree much safer than holding your cell and trying to drive with one hand charger works great products came quick thanks,29,45
6999,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,when i got it there were no instillation instructions and it broke on the first day i would not recommend buying it,22,46
7000,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,it is just unfortunate the design does not fit my vents no way i could use it gave it to someone else some of my friends got the sameand seem to be working great for them,36,47
7001,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,i had many speck cases i love them all they are the best cases made for iphone about this case it is new nice style nice finishing provide good protection the on / off button hard to press but it is not a major issue for me I am happy with this case update aug 29th 2012 after 7 months using the sides started to peel-off consider that i have other cases i switch between so i had this case for a 7 months but use it occasionally it seems to me the new speck s cases are low quality i had many of there cases but the last 3 models were bad quality,111,0
7002,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,goes right on the phone and protects it does the job and the quality is amazing my friend thought it was a 60 - 70 case amazing buy trust me,29,1
7003,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,my son really wanted this gave it to him for christmas and by that night it was already starting to rip the material away from the plastic case my husband glued it hopefully it will last a little longer,40,2
7004,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,it was marked as fitting the iphone 4 and 4s however when i got it i received a case that fit the iphone 5,24,3
7005,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,for the money it did not last the colored cloth actually peels off the case is cloth and it shows stains,21,4
7006,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,great phone case i bought this as a gift for a coworker and he loves it speck products are well engineered and made of solid reliable materials you would be hard pressed to find a speck case i do not like,39,5
7007,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,this case is poorly constructed the matte coating on it quickly started peeling off the case revealing a shiny layer below unfortunately the peeling was not uniform leaving the case looking like it was peeling skin after a bad sunburn the cloth layer on it quickly attracts dirt as well the worst thing about this case is that it also broke after dropping it just once do not buy this case unless your goal is to look like a ragamuffin,78,6
7008,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,horrible it fell apart after a month of having it the fabric started peeling away from the case and was gross,21,7
7009,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,great for protecting iphone but the fabric pieces get frayed around the edges and peel back easily my daughter carries it in her pocket everywhere,25,8
7010,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,this case has worked very well for me unlike the candyshell the fabshell has a sturdy bumper especially by the adapter i was displeased however when the fabric came off it is almost as if the glue melted and just would not hold on after that it was in my pocket so it was not as if i left it in extreme heat i repainted the outside and my phone is still well protected,73,9
7011,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,the digital pattern is really cool and different but the panels are made of fabric this attribute is really nice at first but the adhesive wears off after a while causing the panels to fall off,36,10
7012,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,this case is crap i got one it broke returned it and it broke again the rubber binding came off both times do not buy whatever you do,27,11
7013,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,this was super cute at first it fit great was not too bulky was not too thin but then the fabric started peeling off the side not matter how much i tried glueing it back down it would always curl back up so sure it is cute but it does not have a long life,51,12
7014,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,i bought this for my son he absolutely loved it and i loved the price i will recommend my friends buy this product,22,13
7015,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,the reason i only gave this product 3 stars is because the power button is very difficult to push the cover is cute and it does feel like my phone is well protected with this case on but the power button issue was enough for me to find a different case i use the power button too much to have so much difficulty to push it,66,14
7016,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,my daughter bought one and it fell apart i wrote to the company no answer mine lasted 6 months before the bumperstarted coming away around the buttons and the bottom will not buy a speck product again they last less than 6 months,44,15
7017,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,nice case fits well easy on and off great colors and nice feel in your hand i highly recommend it,20,16
7018,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,this case fits my iphone 4s perfectly well and looks great too the buttons volume and screen-off take a little breaking-into as they are stiff when you first get them but this occurs relatively quickly the case is a tight-fit so there is no fear of it falling off however this makes it a little hard to get off as far as protection quality goes it is probably not the most ideal case but it does the job for the most part it looks great and I am pretty careful with my phone so this case worked perfectly for me,98,17
7019,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,the product i purchased was labelled as like new and i received it quickly enough but the package was extremely dirty and quite obviously stuffed back into the packaging it came in which was taped up with clear scotch tape the case itself was in poor shape the fabric that the design was on was beginning to come off on the bottom and back and after a couple weeks of continued use eventually fell off completely i tried super gluing it but it just looked awful loved the case wish it was the quality i paid for,97,18
7020,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,my husband picked this out for me because it offers great protection for my phone his must and looks cute my must i loved it that is until the fabric started peeling off of the sides within a week of putting it on my phone i tried gluing it back on which i should not have to do but that did not last sadly shopping for a new case,65,19
7021,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,i originally purchased this case at a best buy it worked fine for about 3 months then the fabric sticker on the side of the case began peeling off i had to pull teeth to get speck to replace the case with a new one 3 months later same issue they said that this type of problem is from different lotions on my hands or environmental issues like humidity I am a guy i do not use hand lotions i live in southern california it is warm and dry speck fails to recognize that they have put out a sub-standard product to their consumer base this case is not worth your time the fabric sticker will start to peel with normal use it is cheaply made junk oh and for all my troubles with them they offered me a 20 discount on another junk case they make no thanks speck i will never buy another of your products again and i hope consumers at amazon read this and see how poor quality their products are,173,20
7022,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,I am not sure what all these negative reviews are about i think they are just not sure how to put on a phone case I have heard that the case is too tight and hard to get off well it is tight on your phone but is not that what you want I have heard it is too big and the phone slides around but it fits my iphone 4s perfectly all my cords fit fine and there has plenty of room even for my aux jack in my car the volume buttons and off button are kind of hard to use at first but i got used to it within a day of using it and now i do not even notice so far the fabric is clean and not frayed or anything but i assume over time it will get dirty no big deal although it is what to expect with fabric if you are really annoyed by that possibility then just get some spray that people put on shoes or something and that should help or just get a phone case that is not made of fabric i would probably suggest buying a new one rather than a used one if you want it to look perfect and not dirty or damaged if you do not really care and just want protection I had say go for whatever you want love this case the colors are awesome,227,21
7023,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,bought this case for the wifes iphone 4s after seeing it in the apple store in new york shipping was prompt from amazon as usual the case fits very well with the volume mute button easily accessible however 2 weeks ago the coloured fabric has started to strip from one of the sides requiring me to glue it back on not acceptable i am not sure if i got a bad one but i took off 3 stars as a result,81,22
7024,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,this is my 3d iphone and about my 6th speck case i love the speck fabshell fabric hard she shall cases they have fun colors and designs plus they really protect the phone I have accidentally dropped my phone face down outside on the pavement i picked it up no damage to the phone none at all the case is secure and wraps all the way around with a raised beveledaround the screen the cut-outs are large enough not to because problems especially on the camera cut-out while still protecting the camera lens and the plugs I have never had a problem with the press-thru buttons for the volume and on buttons i click the up volume and the volume instantly gets louder when the fabric starts to show some dirt i simply remove the phone then use a mild soap to wash it let it dry completely and it looks brand new the only reason I have bought so many is i like to switch it up once in a while with a newpattern but i always get another speck and am a loyal speck iphone case user,189,23
7025,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,i got this for my daughters i phone 4s but stole it for my phone whenever anyone sees it they always comment on how cute the cover is i think it is a pretty sturdy case too i did have to put a sep screen protector on although i usually buy covers with the protector built in but i like the cover,61,24
7026,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,no because as soon as i started to use the case the fabric began to peel off there needs to be a better design,24,25
7027,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,first of all this case is very protective I have dropped my phone multiple times and it is fine although the fabric gets discolored and stained and starts pealing of the base of the case after like 2 weeks it is a big let down because now i have to purchase a new case because this looks terrible,55,26
7028,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,while this is a very attractive case and very protective the fabric on the outside does get dull and in some places comes unglued the seller did get this to me in a good amount of time and it was substantially cheaper the one drawback is how hard it is to get off your phone but there are several tutorials on youtube to do this with greater ease,68,27
7029,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,it is different than a lot of the cases I have seen everyone who sees it compliments it and most importantly it has the rubberizedthat protects my phone if i drop it,32,28
7030,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,this case lasted about 3 months before it took a free ride to the landfill the stripes are a glued on fabric that starts to peel off with normal use of the phone save your money and buy something else,40,29
7031,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,purchased this as a christmas gift and my son thought it was excellent compared to the one he already had,20,30
7032,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,i really liked the look of this product and when i got it it was perfect but within a week it was already tearing on the sides and just does not last at all,33,31
7033,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,to start off with i have a tendency of taking most reviews with a grain of salt the whole oh my god this is great bla bla or what the fuck da suq is what many reviews end up being i decided to give this a shot because it was right in the middle and i really liked the pixelated look on of the sides and back i could not have been more wrong the first one i ordered had the fabric coming unglued at the bottom of the case near where the 30 pin connector would go within a week of getting it i contacted amazon and they generously sent me out another i thought i might have been a fluke mail back the original and used the new fast forward a week and half after it is out of return status from amazon and it is doing the same exact thing again i tried to contact specks for help but never got a response i left a message on their voicemail system but to no avail and the company is absolutely worthless with their online chat what ever you do do not get this case you will end up regretting it later on down the road,202,32
7034,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,this case is nice for awhile after about 6 months the fabric started to separate from the plastic this was not too big of a deal since by then it was all wore out and needed to be replaced anyways,39,33
7035,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,took something like 6 months of use but the fabric eventually started peeling away off of the case the fabric will also get dirty you will have to clean it i was not fond of the lip around the front makes it difficult to swipe all the way sometimes i still liked the case although and would still recommend,57,34
7036,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,we bought two of these the first one we bought the fabric material started coming off about a month into getting it we thought we got a bad one so we ordered another one it took a couple of months but the material started coming off again the residue is so sticky it makes it very uncomfortable to use without the fabric will not buy again,66,35
7037,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,great case was looking for a case that did not double the size of my phone all together only reason that i did not give it 5 stars is that it is difficult to get off,34,36
7038,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,on a whim i had picked up one of specks other fabric shells some time ago and i loved it colorful durable but after a while the glue used to fasten the fabric to the plastic she shall started coming undone so i came to amazon to find a replacement the spk-a1009 i received was put together poorly the fabric pieces had not been lined up properly on the plastic she shall and so the fabric sticks out over the lip along the bottom of the case also the fabric piece that runs the along the side with the volume buttons is somewhat frayed toward the bottom i fear this case will not last half as long as the original i picked up,120,37
7039,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,i had previously ordered a speck iphone 4s case and really liked the quality of the case and the protection it offered and so i thought to order a differentscheme when i came across this pixelated looking print i thought it would be a great purchase different from what others might have when it arrived i was immediately disappointed the printed material on the back is essentially a glued on piece of fabric which showed signs of peeling already when i received it needless to say the fabric began peeling off from the corners soon after definitely cheaply made and would not recommend this to others,108,38
7040,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,i love the fabshell fabric hard she shall speck case is a fabulous product it is very protective and it is the perfect pattern i hightly recommend it,25,39
7041,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,do not buy this case while it does provide protection it frays at the edges quickly after you begin using it,21,40
7042,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,i bought this cover and it lasted me about a month I am a medicine student so it is not like my phone was exposed to harsh conditions the speck letters completely came off and the two lateral sides these fabric hard cases look nice but they will not last long,48,41
7043,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,I have owned two of these cases now they are very attractive they protect the phone but the quality is pretty awful the first one fell apart in 6 months the second one had the fabric separating from the case in 3 months the holes in the second case also did not match up with the ports on the phone really this case looks nice but the quality is awful,67,42
7044,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,i love the fit and protection as well as the fun design the cons are the difficulty getting the case off when needed and the fabric on the case is fraying and coming unglued from the side i would not choose the fabric version in the future otherwise great case,50,43
7045,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,bought my fiance this case less than 2 months ago the cloth comes apart and frays very easily the glue used seems to be weak and wear out causing the cloth to seperate from the plastic portion of the case for the money should last a bit longer,48,44
7046,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,i purchased this case and after using for about 3 months it started to tear at the edges the fabric is not glued on well enough i sent it back to speck since there is a year warranty but because i purchased from an illegal seller fangfang he on amazon who apparently was selling counterfeit cases i do not get a replacement case from speck it was pretty disappointing only buy directly from speck,73,45
7047,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,i get compliments on this case all the time the design is solid and my iphone remains in perfect condition after a few drops however after 2 months the cloth became very dirty and faded now the cloth is coming unglued from the case,44,46
7048,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,i like the style but the durability is questionable the side fabric fell off within a month and the back gets dirty quick the price is not right for this product,31,47
7049,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,i originally had the candy she shall case and i loved it i had it for a few months before i dropped it and broke the bottom i loved the colors on this case so i thought i would give it a shot within 3 days of use the fabric had started to fray on the bottom corners i have had it a month now and the fabric has frayed on eachof the phone now i have tried glue and clear fingernail polish and it just looks tacky so i am now going to trash it and buy another candy she shall one,103,48
7050,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,the case is excellent i dropped my phone on concrete face down and not a scratch on it unfortunately the fabric started peeling fairly soon after purchase just superglued it back down also the fabric gets dirty not easy to clean i like theand pattern but too hard to care for,53,49
7051,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,the fabric covering the plastic started peeling off after 2 days had to discard theit is useless would not recommend,21,50
7052,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,this is a great little case fits well nice colors i like the protection I have dropped my iphone 4 several times with nary a scratch however be warned that theareas are done in a thin cloth which picks up dirt dust coffee and more and within a week the colors are already stained and faded washing with a cloth does not seem to help i love this case but had not expected the colors to be damageable cloth update 11/13/12 I have had this case for a few months now and it continues to provide good protection but the colors have become so dirty and stained just by normal use that it now looks grimy and disgusting and I am going to have to buy another i will not be buying one with a cloth covering,135,51
7053,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,this case is really beautiful i love the colors and it fits the phone perfectly however some of the edges of the fabric started to fray almost immediately as some other people shared however i do not think that it is really that noticeable as long as it does not continue to get worse it is a unique case and i would still recommend it seller promptly sent theand it arrived exactly as described,72,52
7054,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,when i ordered this case i was worried it would be cheap or break easily it arrived and i was happily surprised to see that a it was just as cute as it looked online b it seemed durable and c it fit my phone iphone 4 not 4s perfectly i was happy for a few months with this product until i tried toit the bottom of this case is really thick so the only way tothe phone on an ihome or any similar device is to remove it from the case this would not be a big deal except that the case is a pain to take on and off i really thought i was going to snap my phone in half the first time i tried to take the case off i am hunting around again for a different case because i need to take this one off at least twice a day and it is just not worth it,164,53
7055,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,compared to other speck cases i am more comfortable with this one piece design previously i had a two piece speck case and it lasted for one or two drops depending on impact before a corner broke apart leaving the case useless which is better than a broken screen I am going tohad this for a month or so and have no issues with the fit of the case the bottom fit is a little loose but my phone does not slide around in the case only the bottom lip have a little bit of give all in all for the price this is good and has met my expectations,108,54
7056,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,i bought this case because 1 it looks really nice and i love the colors and 2 i heard speck was a good brand even although i liked the case i returned it since i was not able to use my aux cord in my car to play music if you have a standard aux cord it will not plug in the whole way that was a deal breaker for me also the material is like a fabric so the white part would have gotten dingy quickly,86,55
7057,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,i purchased this product and after about a week on the phone the side striping started to peel off i am not a hard user of my phone so the reason this occurred is not because of misuse i contacted speck to see if i could take advantage of the warranty since it has started to deteriorate but they have informed me that they do not recognize this retailer and that they will not honor any warranty because it is not an authorized retailer I am not out of the money it cost and i will not buy from this person again speck suggested this may be a fake case since it has fallen apart so quickly,113,56
7058,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,this is a really stiff case which is great for protect the phone and looking good however if say you want to switch the case or trying to use a headphone that can not into the jack because of the case then you will run into difficulty trying to take it off,50,57
7059,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,received this case in dirty condition it wa brand new but very poorly made fits terrible I shall never buy a speck product again,23,58
7060,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,fit perfectly sturdy and seems to provide a great degree of protection allows the use of back camera and can be changed in a snap although not the cheapest i highly recommend it as in the past i bought the cheaper models and found that they provide little protection also fits over a screen cover if you use one,59,59
7061,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,i was so excited to receive this product the colors look exactly like the photo and the case is very hard and offers excellent protection one minor thing to add is that it is a little difficult to remove at times i know some people are saying it gets dirty quickly and this is true when my case first got dirty i put it inside a pair of gym short pockets dropped it in the washer on delicate looked brand new let it air dry,84,60
7062,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,hey so i was not really looking forward to the look of this case just got it for the protection but it is so much nicer than the picture makes it seem especially on a white iphone i love it definitely recommend,40,61
7063,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,i love this case i get asked about it almost every time i use my phone it is not too bulky yet seems to protect the phone just fine although i have not dropped it at first i was not pleased because it seemed to get dirty quickly but a tide stain sick took out the stains and then i scotchguarded it i have not had any other problems,65,62
7064,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,speck usually makes great cases but this one was an absolute piece of garbage it offers no protection which is what i expected and so should you with any case this low profile but still something to note the fabric is cheap and was poorly attached was already coming off right out of the packaging the case does not even fit the phone correctly and there was a large amount of room for the phone to slide back and forth unacceptable i had this case on my phone for maybe 2 hours before printing the return shipping labels please do not waste your time money or energy with this awful product,110,63
7065,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,i bought this case almost 15 days ago and now i have the bottom part broken is material but is unglueing it self hate this case and speck mark,29,64
7066,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,i was a little hesitant to buy this with some of the reviews but i found a solution for the problem a lot of people complain about how this case gets dirty really fast my sister works for payless and they sell this spray that helps protect your shoes from dirt and mud so i decided i would spray that on the case before i used it and it has worked really well after about 3 weeks i had a few small smudges so i cleaned them off and resprayed the case and now it is back to repelling dirt again so just reapply every few weeks to keep it clean it is a little hard to get your phone out of the case so if you change the case a lot you will be frustrated with this one,138,65
7067,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,love this case beautiful stylish and fits my iphone 4s perfectly one flaw when it arrived i noticed some of the fabric looks like it is peeling away from the plastic after a month it has not budged and still looks good fingers crossed it stays together still love it although,49,66
7068,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,all the other reviews led me to buy this case but it does not even fit my iphone 4 right the sides are to wide on the lower half so my iphone has room to slide around all although this case has style I am dissatisfied and i would not recommend this case i looked at the packaging more closely and it was in a fabshell burton packaging and this case sing in the burton category the packaging was already taped and ripped this is probably counterfeit or already returned,87,67
7069,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,i just received my fabshell iphone case and i love it very nice colors snug fit and it does not interfere with using the camera,26,68
7070,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,well this is my second speck product and i will have to say that I am another satisfied customer i love the colors it fits nice on my iphone 4s easy access to all functions on the phone and the only con would be trying to get it off and it is a little bulky but i guess that is how the fabshell product is so overall I am pleased about the purchase and great price,71,69
7071,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,i could not wait for thisto be shipped to me so i chose the express shipping method this case is incredible i have dropped my phone twice and this case protected it so well that there is not even a scratch on my phone it is nice because it is a sturdy hard plastic material the blue bars ofare fun too overall great purchase it is definitely worth the investment the only thing i do not like about this case is that the buttons over the hold button and the volume buttons are sort of hard to press aside from that it is an awesome case,104,70
7072,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,i orginally wanted the burton fabshell but did not find any on amazon so i bought this one instead love thescheme of this case and the feeling of it like many people say this case is sort of like a combination of the candyshell and speck fitted case i own the candyshell case but found it sometimes too bluky when i put it in my jean pocket i also did not like that the fitted cases did not cover the volume and sleep buttons so i find that th fabshell cases are a perfect mix between those two cases it is not bulky and it has the design of the fitted case however some cons includes the cloth may get dirty over time depending on your lifestyle of course for me i use my phone all the time i bring it everywhere the gym parkalso i feel like the bottom part of the case below the home button may eventually begin to sag depending on how you treat your case I have been using this case for a little over a month now and it is still in good shape i also found that the sleep button takes a bit of pressure to press with the case on,208,71

7177,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,3.0,neutral,it took long to come which i expected yet when i recieved the case it was silicone it was supposed to be a hard case then i heard how easily the ears break and all that bad stuff and was kinda happy it was silicone but you can tell it is very fake it does not look like the photo it looks like the boy stitch just pink no lashes no differentnose nothing it is very bulky also i could not deal with it and had to take it off after 2 days,92,104

7183,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,2.0,negative,this product was so cute to look at i was so excited that the price was affordable and what not however the material it was made in is very unforgiving to any fall or mishap i dropped it once at a small distance and it shattered completely it also was very bulky and much larger than expected in the picture so basically it is cute cheap and unique on the flip side although the flaws in functionality do not compensate for the positive aspects,83,110

7225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,it was really cute when i got it it is the first iphone case that i got for myself no technical problems at all except that the colors of the ears were not tan they were actually the sameas the body itself the nose was not purple but red the toes got dirty really easily and some of the material on the toes got scrapped off as long as you do not drop it it should last for awhile in case you do drop it it is okay i dropped mine after 2 weeks it sliced open and all the buttons on the side popped off but i was able to fix it easily by putting in back the buttons and just super gluing the sides back together people say it is big but it is actually not it fits my back pocket just perfect with it is head peeking out i give thisan overall 4 because although it is not exactly like the picture it is close cheap cute and very fixable what i do recommended if you get thisis to keep the ears closed at most times not only do keeping the ears in will keep your screen untouched from a tables surface but it will keep it from breaking,210,152
7226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,3.0,neutral,for the price you can not beat the cover but the quality is not the greatest do not drop it or it is gone with a 12 year old using it the clip for the ears gave out in about 2 weeks but have to say it is cute and cheap,51,153

7312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,2.0,negative,i received my disney 3d stitch movable ear flip case but one of the ears is not working the day i received my package one of the ears would not pop up,32,239
7313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,warning it is not the same stitch as shown in the picture if you look at the other pink stitches sold by other amazon sellers that is what it looks like ears are pink there is no purple heart nose i chose this one because it looked different from the rest but guess not besides that it is adorable still of course it came in 4 weeks i wish it would have come sooner but they it is from china airmail so i can not be too stingy there i bought a used one and it does not look used at all unlike the blue stitch i ordered hopefully the ears will not break like my blue one did as well it did not come in a nice packaged box but it was not broken there was no damage it just came in a plastic seal with a screen protector the nose is beautiful velvet red and it is sweet and feminine the buttons match fine with my iphone 4s you have to take the head off to turn it on silent which i personally do not give a shist about I had recommend it just keep in mind it is not the one shown in the picture that is all over and out another thing is that when the ears are in it covers up a bit of the top of the screen it gets annoying you will have to deal with it ear phone jack and charger jack once it is in it is hard to take out if you are paranoid about breaking something same goes with the case it will not come off strange,259,240
7314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,3.0,neutral,this is a really cute case i love it but her ears broke in less than a week so now my case has broken ears it is still a cute case but not as cute as it could be with the vibration button being on the side of the phone it is hard to keep my phone on ring because when putting on her head the button pushes down and puts the phone on vibrate other than these things the case is really cool it is very sturdy I have dropped my phone a few times with this case and there has been no damage on either the phone or the case i just with her ears would still work,118,241
7315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,3.0,neutral,pros very cute attracted lots of attention and compliments arrived before time in proper packaging both ears work great very easy to slide on and off your phone cons did not come with screen protector ears broke in a week can not access silence button without sliding the head off very big and clunky can not fit into pocket eaily,58,242
7316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,2.0,negative,so i got my case yesterday and was so happy and it is adorable but the ear broke so if i click the button it does not stop we are it should and dies across my phone screen and i have not dropped it or anything,44,243

7318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,2.0,negative,it says that you get a screen protector but i did not receive one and the ear broke within hours also i want to say that i like to keep my phone on silent and when i go to put the case on it turns the not silent button on,50,245
7319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,i love it it arrived 1 week before it was due but the reason i give it a 4 is because on the product i got which is pink disney 3d stitch movable ear flip hard case cover for iphone 4/4s 1 screen protector the ears on the case one is to tight so when i push the button that makes then come it dose not and the other ear is way to loose it is so loose that even if i set it down gently the ear comes out but all in all i love the case it was everything i wished for expcet for the ears,109,246

7380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,2.0,negative,i was looking for an extended battery without the bulk for my epic 4 g touch for a while i came across this one but was hesitant because there were no reviews on it i was able to find some reviews on xda which were hit and miss on this battery well i have been charging and discharging fully for about 2 weeks and found that the battery is about the same as the stock 1800mah battery with 500mah more than stock one would expect to have about 20 - 30 more battery life but this one come up far short if it improved i will add update but for now i would recommend another battery than this one,116,4

7382,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,out of all the items I have purchased with amazon this company has the best customer service dept if you are unsatisfied they will do what ever it takes to make their customers get what they are paying for my battery was not the best but they made it right as soon as i asked no questions asked so i have to give them 5 stars because you really can not ask for anything more from a company,75,6
7383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,1.0,negative,had a lot of difficulty getting my phone or external charger to recognize the battery was present much less charge it managed to get external charger to recognize for one full charge after charged it did last longer than my original 1800 mah battery however because i wanted to condition as instructed on amazon page i allowed it to fully discharge before connecting it to a charger again now it will not recharge at all in either phone or external charger now I am hoping for a refund or exchange to see if this was just the one batter a single charged use is not what i was paying for like thebut the battery needs work,117,7
7384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,I have purchased several aftermarket batteries and have been disappointed with thier performance but ever since my s2 upgraded to jelly bean the battery performance as been horrible so i decided to try this battery with it is higher mahs out right out of the box the battery is a bit heavier that the oem batteries that i have which i consider a good sign it is not going to make the phone significantly heavier or anything but the added weight in my book means that there is evidence that this battery really does have more juice in it anyway i was getting 4 - 6 hours out of my phone prior to this and I am back over 8 hours using this battery so I am very pleased with the result,125,8
7385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,took a while to get here but it doubled my battery life without making my phone huge and ugly perfect for the price i paid,25,9

7388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,1.0,negative,i purchase this battery for my samsung galaxy s2 sph-d710 from boost mobile i was trying to find a miracle battery so i do not have to buy the thick battery with a thick cover unfortunately miracles do not happen if samsung did not came with a 2300 mah slim battery is because it is no way to make one to fit using the same cover i fallow direction from vendor and the first week i was happy and impress the second week i was kind of wondering what happen with the 2300 mah at the third week i gave up the battery never gave me more hours or power to say it is a 20 - 30 more life time the reason i gave one star is because after i complain to the vendor they without a question send me a credit i still looking for some company who can build this battery with a real cell to hold the more than 72 watts we need to have at least 20 hours of battery after used the phone like a phone,177,12
7389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,4.0,positive,i made the mistake of not properly conditioning my orginal oem battery so as it was on a normal day without my kids playing games i was lucky to keep a charge beyond 400 pm it was to a point where if i could plug in a charger and use it i did i was considering getting a larger battery that would require a new case adding bulk to my phone however I am glad i went with this one under the same conditions as before and with a properly conditioned battery I am able to maintain a working charge well after I am on my way home 630 pm in most cases when i get home i usually have 10 or so left by the time i go to bed 1000ish the phone is pretty much done assuming a do not use it much after I am home but the combination of properly conditioning the battery and the extended life are just about perfect for my needs during the week on weekends when i hand off the phone to the kids or with heavy use i need to put it on a charger around 2 pm to get throught the day considering that i did not add bulk to the phone and I am not tied to a charger throughout the day I am very happy with it,221,13

7399,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,i see there are a lot of doubters out there but i had this battery for a few weeks i went through the whole charging and fully draining process 3x and my battery consistently gives me twice the life of the old one of course this is comparing it to a year old battery but it is still impressive the size is slightly bigger then stock but will still fit in your stock compartment get it you will not regret it,79,23

7440,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,3.0,neutral,this case is a more affordable alternative to incases birds nest iphone case however the cheaper price also reflects less quality quick wear and tear shortly after daily use that is carrying phone in purse,34,8

7442,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,2.0,negative,cover arrived timely and even although shipping was free my mail person had to charge me 150 at the door because the correct weight was not labeled on the package so i paid nearly as much for the free shipping as i did for the cover the cover itself looks cute and has the cool rubberized feeling but does absolutely no good for the phone it clips to the metal sides of the iphone and does not even come even with the front glass so one drop and my phone would have been shattered also the cover picked up everything it is white so a little staining can be expected but the cover was not white past the first 12 hours it was on my phone and it stayed mostly in my pocket during that time definitely worth it to spend the 35 on the name brand covers,144,10
7443,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,4.0,positive,is very nice but is very easy to spot,20,11
7444,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,5.0,positive,this is so cool and looks even better on phone than we imagined tons of compliments highly recommend this you will be very happy with this purchase,27,12
7445,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,4.0,positive,I am sooooo in love with this case one of my favorite cases it is so unique and different the only thing i did not like about the case was it got dirty veryyyyy quick from your hands also it started to peel quickly,41,13
7446,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,2.0,negative,the look of the case is really cute however on the case i received it bubbles out a little bit over the area where the volume buttons are located also the spray paint used on the case does not cover the plastic base entirely so flecks of grey show through in places all in all it is a really cool looking phone case from a far but will not pass close sructiny in the end i paid very little for it so i can not exactly expect that it is flawless,88,14
7447,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,3.0,neutral,i have ordered 2 cases were on timeis good but gets dirty very soon looks fine on my iphone 4,22,15
7448,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,i liked the design of this case it was solidly built and if had a good feel on the phone but the design is applied horribly to the case it looks like a clear case with a sticker on it the design is supposed to go all the way around the sides but it stops short and looks cheap,59,0
7449,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,i was really excited about this case but when i received it it did not look the way i expected the image looks like it was stretched to fit the dimensions of the cover so not only does it look unrealistic it looks pretty stupid the dimensions of a cassette tape are not the same as an iphone so it looks strange when you see it which is not represented by the picture good thing it was cheap,77,1
7450,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,of course this cover is wicked cute who does not want their phone to look like a cassette tape from their youth be warned however that this case is not in the least bit protective there has no bumper of any kind it is purely for looking awesome which it accomplishes well,46,2
7451,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,not what i expected it looked very real in the picture but when i was not so real in fact i do not like,24,3
7452,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,true it is hard plastic and husband works as welder it has taken a lot of abuse ppl really think he has talking to a cassette tape,24,4
7453,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,thiswas causing a glare on all photos taken had to take a black sharpie andon the case around the camera hole to stop the glare other than that it is a good case,37,5
7454,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,horrible received the product thinking i could actually use it for some sort of protection wrong it is literally the cheapest kind of plastic out there the sticker or whatever they put on it does not even go all around the edges / sides of the product once you put it on you literally have to pry it off with something plus the edges of it are extremely sharp which makes it even harder to take off does not even look good unless you are going on a spending spree for things ugly things you will never use you should not even consider this product,97,6
7455,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,not a synthesized cassette like the cute rubberized ones you see out there if you went to a website like cafepress and uploaded a picture of a cassette face to an iphone cover this is what you would get yes it is basically a picture of a cassette on the back of an iphone cover you will not get that are you carrying around a cassette reaction because it is rather clearly an iphone cover and not well a cassette the good it is hard and does not flop off if you really hate that the rubberized cute ones fall off but you just want the image of a cassette without your phone being morphed into one you can buy this case it is not really worth me returning it so sadly i will try to bestow it on someone or recycle it not a fan,141,7
7456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,it took about 3 - 4 weeks to get to me which sucked since I am an impatient person but that is not really the worst part when i receive the phone case i immediately put it on my phone it did not fit i have a 4s and the case is for a 4 does not matter since the 4/4s are the same size so it should have fit but one side just did not reach all the way around to latch on my phone completely i will not bother returning it since it is a cheap case anyways and identification most-likely have to pay for shipping the picture of the cassette was not all that great either but i expected that oh well with it being so cheap you get crap quality so i would not recommend this to anyone,131,8
7457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,bought this for a friend who needed cases he liked it it is working for him can not complain it is doing it is job,21,9
7458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,love the versatility for those kids who never had to buy a cassette tape this case is perfect for you,20,10
7459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,i was less impressed with this cover because it just looks like a picture slapped on hard plastic it is look is ok but nothing great,25,11
7460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,i liked the design I am old enough to remember owning many of the real thing the price was not bad at all and the case arrived much sooner than i had anticipated however the picture printed on the case is slightly diagonal and stretched toward the end it would not be so obvious if it were not for the fact that the numbers are printed there,62,12
7461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,this product is lousy you definitely are paying for what you recieve the print looked horrible and the plastic would hardly withstand a good fall do not spend your money on this case,34,13
7462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,this is not even a printed decal it is like a copy-machine copy of another case this thing is a joke the plastic / rubber is also really flimsy the phone will slip out easily,33,14
7463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,do not waste your time and money it is literally a picture on a piece of plastic a very cheap piece of plastic plastic pos,23,15
7464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,i have dropped my iphone several times in this case with no damage to the phone plus i love the reaction i get from people when they think it is a cassette tape,33,16
7465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,it was not protective of my iphone and the design on the case looked like it was printed on badly,20,17
7466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in this product of the three covers i ordered this one took the longest to arrive when it finally arrived the cover was very distorted so much so that it does not look like a cassette it made me sad because of the three it is the one i really wanted i would have returned it but i felt it was not worth it because it was 2 i would order another one but i do not want to risk getting another bad one,83,18
7467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,this is such a fun case everyone thinks my phone is actually a cassette tape when the back side is side up i really enjoy it,26,19
7468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,it is better than the average cassette cases you see because those are hard to get in and out of your pocket whereas this case somehow still has a soft unique texture but goes in and out of your pocket so easily slim fit does not make your phone look bulky at all but it is just a picture on the back not actual cassette looking which is fine with me arrived 2 weeks before estimated delivery date d,77,20
7469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,i love this case i show it off to everyone looks so real and was super cheap I have even dropped it a few times and has not cracked or chipped,29,21
7470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,the design is great i get a lot of compliments on it but it is overall manufacture is just average at best,21,22
7471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,these cases r to be expected based on what was paid for them they r really cool and my son enjoys his,22,23
7472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,love it but it is really hard to get case off while on the phone great case although would order again,20,24
7473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,thisis plastic buy perfectly priced and stylish i would definitely purchase again from same vendor / brand much better than the overpriced store versions,24,25
7474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,it came weeks earlier than expected and it is a really cool case just a bit tricky to remove overall although great purchase and so affordable,25,26
7475,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,you should not buy this if you have high hopes for a phone case it is just a plastic back to your iphone and it will not provide much coverage or protection fr your phone however i take pretty good care of my phone and this case does it is job for me i was just looking for a cool looking case that would not make my phone feel too fat and would not hurt my wallet this works just fine,75,27
7508,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,this is a well-made leather case which fits the motorola droid razr maxx fairly well the case cover is thick leather with a lining which makes the flap stick out a bit when closed there are slots at the bottom which makes it easy to remove the phone by pushing up with a finger the belt clip is detachable and has a hook on the end to prevent it from slipping off your belt a feature that is essential however with enough pressure as when getting into a car seat the clip will detach but it is easy to reinsert it there is another flap clip with a snap but this is upside down and will come unsnapped with used on a belt now a warning about the magnetic clasp the razr maxx has a well-known problem with the magnetic sensor which is used for the compass function if the phone is exposed to a strong magnet the sensor can become frozen and the compass will not work this happened to me with this case and also to my partner who has the same phone it is easy enough to unstick it google it but to prevent it from happening i pried out the magnet with a screwdriver it comes out easily with no damage to the case i replaced the magnetic clasp with a couple of pieces of velcro and I am very happy with the result,237,0
7509,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,2.0,negative,this case was nice and constructed well but it has two real bad design flaws first when i tried to wear it with my slacks and no belt i immediately saw that the plastic clip was set way too low on the back of the case this as the effect of letting the case and my phone sag away from my body and stick out at about a 60 degree angle the case was always getting bumped and snagged on everything when i tried wearing it with jeans and a belt just using the leather belt snap it rode on my belt like it should fairly snug against my waist i thought that i could at least wear it that way but the snaps are way too weak and it would come unsnapped when i was getting out of my car i wound up giving it to a coworker who has the same phone but i do not think he likes it either it is still sitting on his desk and he is not using it,175,1
7510,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,it seems to be well made but the clip causes the whole thing to stick too far off my side,20,2
7511,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,cover flap could have a stronger magnetic clasp seems to open to easily inside the pouch it is somewhat rough I am thinking it may scratch the screen,26,3
7512,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,1.0,negative,i love the design of the case it easily handles the razr and provides fast access now with this being said the magnetic button that hold the case closed ripped out in two months had this had a flat magnet design this would not of happened now i need to go out and buy another one i guess you get what you pay for but good only for a couple of months really,70,4
7513,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,the case design is perfect the open slot on the bottom of the case makes sure that the on / off button does not get pressed while in the case i had a solid case before and wondered why my battery was not lasting very long the phone was turning on while in the case it will not happen in this case when the phone is placed in it correctly the magnetic catch is strong enough for normal use i added a piece of self-adhesive velcro to the flap to make sure it stays closed but i have to admit i am rough on cell phones and cases i do like the way it hooks on your belt the extra piece that snaps is very secure absolutely no way for it to slip off of your belt again best design that i have found for the motorola razr maxx also shipping was very prompt purchased from cell-stuff thru amazon,157,5
7514,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,this case fits the droid raxrmaxx hd perfectly the magnetic clasp on the flap is nice and strong what i like most about this case is the belt clip and belt strap arrangement first the belt clip has a bottom hook to hook under your belt to keep the case from coming off the belt next there are two snap straps that come around the belt in the opposite direction your belt is totally captured by this case and it is impossible for the case to come off your belt great value i had one of these for a long time and it lasted nicely time to refresh so i got another,111,6
7515,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,great design unfortunately after about a month the case tore at the belt snap i glued the belt flap closed it works fine,23,7
7516,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,great fit and function was durable allowed easy of answering the phone or silencing the ringer from below i would recommend this product,23,8
7517,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,2.0,negative,pros nice looking case con the plastic holster clip on this does not stay in place well the case fell off of the holster clip on the first day my husband used it the snap on the leather strap is weak as well so my husband has resorted to using the leather strap and holster clip at the same time for it to stay on,64,9
7518,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,the price was right for it and it fit my phone perfect i would buy another one when i buy a cell phone,23,10
7519,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,better than expected good quality sleek look very comfortable i recommend anyone to get this nice job amazon keep up the good work,23,11
7520,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,the main body of the case is indeed sturdy the plastic belt clip is not it broke within a few weeks of use the leather belt clip with snap is flimsy i expect it to break and will not buy another unless it has a much better belt clip system,50,12
7521,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,nice quality however it does not fit to the waist as well as i thought it would i do not use it often and just choose to carry my phone for the time being,33,13
7522,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,2.0,negative,does not stay closed magnet weak when you try to close this it just pops off again the magnet is to weak,22,14
7523,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,1.0,negative,i did not fit my razor maxx the belt snap arrived broken the leather was nice but totally the holster was useless,22,15
7524,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,1.0,negative,my motorola razr maxx would not fit into case the case was not long enough would not buy again the vertical case was way to tight,26,16
7525,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,anything hanging off my belt seems to get caught on everything i get near good pouch but it is not for me,22,17
7526,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,this leather case holds the droid razr maxx in a very secure and convenient location on your belt it is magnetic snap is strong enough to avoid accidental openings while still easy to open intentionally leather loop option on back holds the case level and close to the belt better than than plastic clip but both are included so user can choose which to use this case is much more convenient and more professional in appearance than the plastic case that i originally got with my droid razr maxx,88,18
7527,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,works very well much better than others i have tried i have had it for 3 weeks and the clip has not broken,22,19
7528,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,surprised me i gambled on buying it because i was not sure the magnetic flap closure would be any good turns out it does a good job the whole thing looks good provides easy access would recommend,36,20
7529,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,it holds the phone but if you have a case on the phone it is a tight fit and does not want to stay shut i would not recommend this to anyone that wants to have a case on the phone and then have some way to carry it too it does not work well for that,54,21
7530,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,1.0,negative,be careful of these cases i have bought two sold specifically for a certain phone and they are too small,20,22
7531,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,1.0,negative,my droid razr maxx with plastic cover can not fit in the case too expensive to return so it is useless for me,21,23
7532,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,the droied razr naxx hd is one of the larger of the breed but it does fit in this pouch but without any protective she shall on the phone,28,24
7533,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,not a great fit a bit snug cover snaps open with little effort wouldrecommend to a friend so-so,20,25
7534,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,3.0,neutral,i have this phone exactly one week today after switching from tmobile-which I have been with for years and my last phone was a htc mytouch the connect is sleek fast and the screen is amazing however i do not think that the great qualities out-numbered the bad the most annoying thing is that the battery finishes like every hour i am not running any more apps than what i did on my htc the bluetooth wifi and gps satellites are all off to save the battery but it does not help i do not get if the phones nova screen and the dual-processor takes a lot of power why would metro pcs sell the phone with only a 1500mah when there are other strengths out there available like the 1800 mah shacking my head now i have to consider spending another 30 45 on an extended battery which makes the phone even bulkier another thing i dislike about the phone is the front camera it is not as excellent as the rear-facing camera i would not mind using the rear-facing camera if there was a shutter button on the side i can use since i can not see on the screen if I am trying to take a pic of myself if the battery and front cam were better i would be more satisfied considering the price paid for phone-not exactly cheap,221,0
7535,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,this phone is the best phone on metropcs as of may 2012 the processor is fast there is plenty of memory the 4 g speeds are great for metropcs there are only two draw backs the battery life and the power button battery life is a typical problem for all smart phones i still ended up buying a 2600 mah after market battery so that i could make it through the day a car charger and extra wall chargers are an absolute necessity if you want to be sure to have juice all day the other annoyance is the power button it is set slightly more centered on the top the button is not where you would expect to find it it is also flush with the surface making it difficult to feel since it is used frequently to unlock the screen you can see how this would be an issue the screen is large enough that my now aging eyes can see it but it is not so large that i can not slip it in my pocket the display is bright and sharp of course it does all the normal android things since you are reading this you likely have already compared the raw factory specs so there is no point in listing all the basic info if you have not seen them scroll up the page give them a look would i buy this phone again yes was it worth the cash yes,242,1
7536,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,2.0,negative,this is a decent enough smartphone fast and easy to use the major flaw with this phone is that the battery drains very fast i can not use my gps for 30miles without having it on charge if you plan on buying this phone u need to get the car charger and also a extended battery pack would not be a badeither when i use the phone as a gps unit whilst on charge it will not actually charge it just stops it discharging phone gets very hot and comes up with a message saying place phone in cool area just before it shuts down if you have the money identification recommend something from verizon but not a bad buy if yo lik dem gettopcs fones,125,2
7537,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,1.0,negative,this is terrible piece of equipment lost my lg esteem metro pcs insurance provider sent me this instead esteem had more features a battery that worked and lasted 12 hours or more this one shuts itself off unmounts the sd card then turns off gps stops working if you use car charger and have gps on the battery gets so hot you can not hold the phone or have it in your lap while driving the battery even when charging can not keep up with the current drain used by the gps application so the phone dies after 15 - 2 hours terrible terrible service not worth the effort,105,3
7538,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,2.0,negative,this phone had promise but it is not a good phone it is fast at times but sometimes it is very slow to respond the touch screen could have been more responsive it is not an exaggeration to say that this phone has one of the worst battery life of all phones i ever used,55,4
7539,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,1.0,negative,screen does not stay on lit when punching in numbers it is hard to turn the screen back on I am very disappointed with the phone my other phone lg esteem is great but this one is faulty,34,5
7540,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,2.0,negative,what is the point of having a good phone if you can not use it because it is always dead or on the verge of dying i can not wait to get a new phone,33,6
7541,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,great phone great price only thing keeping it from getting a 5 star review is the cheap accessories that come along with the phone had to replace the charger immediately as it was doa,32,7
7542,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,3.0,neutral,i love the phone but had to purchase the extended battery i actually brought two it does everything i need but the battery life is very short without the extended battery the regular lasts a few hours maybe it is still a great phone,43,8
7543,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,5.0,positive,bought this phone for my mom for christmas it runs great on metros 4 g service and the phone itself if very responsive and has great colors on the screen,29,9
7544,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,3.0,neutral,not so great battery p dead after just 2hrs of usage apps and all the phone itself however is so keen fast and loaded with everything u need your phone to perform absolutely amazing just the battery is my problem,40,10
7545,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,5.0,positive,i have had lgs before this is a great phone battery life is not great but i can live with that,21,11
7546,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,the phone was in good condition as described the only thing was that the charger included with the phone did not work i had another charger so it was not a big deal really but because of that i could only give 4 stars i would recommend to others and buy from again,52,12
7547,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,1.0,negative,do not even consider this phone i am not exaggerating it is a peice of junk that will not last any time and might just burn your home down if you are not careful this phone got so hot that i had to place it in the freezer for fear it might self-ignite it actually gave me over-heating error message a number of times to make matters worst it does not hold the charge and even tho i purchased an extended battery i had to walk around with my chargers car and home i eventually got rid of it and purchased galaxy s iii total waste of my 26900 plus accessories for it totaling another 4000,114,13
7548,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,5.0,positive,happy with this phone it works speedily and well and i have not had to reset or remove the battery because of a freezup good phone reception i would recommend it to anyone,32,14
7549,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,i had this phone for about a year now this is phone works very very well the processor is fast the phone barely lags the only downside to this phone is the battery life it gets drained rather quickly other than that this phone will run any app you throw at it,52,15
7550,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,the title says it all i have owned my lg connect since may 2012 it is fast and responsive the build quality like all lg phones is superb i have accidentally dropped this phone a few times i use a simple gel case with absolutely no damage to the phone battery yes depending on usage the battery life can be as short as 8 hours with a fair usage of google maps navigator which seems to eat up the battery also i use the lg hb-700 stereo bluetooth hands-free unit another product that you will wonder how you did without and have found that this also tends to lessen the battery life the solution is simply to plug in the phone when i am driving or sitting at my desk typing and streaming music to my bluetooth headset negative comment the only real negative comment that i can offer is that the location on the keyboard for the change language setting key is so horribly placed that you will find yourself suddenly typing in a foreign language when you accidentally hit the dreaded key it should not even be on the keyboard aughhhhh overall quality build made in korea very good screen quick on the web syncs seamlessly with all my gmail contacts and accounts i would but another and in fact have recommended this phone to several friends who love it as well,236,16
7551,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,5.0,positive,if you do not want to go with any of the big companies to get a great phone this phone would be a really good alternative the internet is blazing fast i even got faster speeds than t-mobile and sprint when i ran a speed test over their 4 g network,49,17
7552,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,3.0,neutral,i had an lg connect for a couple of months it was really buggy it would not remember the individual and group contact ringtones after i powered off it would randomly decide new ringtones totally annoying and defeats the whole purpose of having different ringtones when i was using a bluetooth the google voice dialer only worked through the phone not through the bluetooth even although the dialer said that the bluetooth was on it could initiate the call using bluetooth but once it started dialing it ran through the native speaker on the phone i had to turn the bluetooth off and then back on in the dialer interface to get it to route the audio to the headset which defeats the purpose of handsfree dialing also it had a bug in the texting program so my texts would often duplicate and send twice and i would receive duplicate texts from others totally annoying that never happened on metropcs for me before so i blame the phone and the battery life really sucked i bought an extended life battery and it still only barely made through a work day and that was using a battery saver app the lg motion has come out and I have had it for a week because the connect was driving me crazy with the bugs the motion is by far a better phone and a lot cheaper right now,234,18
7553,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,5.0,positive,this is probably the best phone currently available on metropcs if you get their service in your area and do not want to burn money but still want a smartphone get this one,32,19
7554,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,4.0,positive,you need to update the firmware on it right after unboxing the updated firmware has less disconnect issues than what it is shipped with sonys official app works okay but has a lot if issues with randomly disconnecting and occasionally getting killed i have not used it much there is an app called openliveview that reimplements the liveview protocol it maintains a much more stable connection than the official one it sends notifications and texts to the phone more reliably and has music controls unfortunately it does not yet have plugin support it is open source although so if there is a feature you must have you can add it yourself,109,0
7555,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,2.0,negative,the software is horrible and hard to navigate there is an opensource version that i like better but have not been able to get it to connect reliably the plugin feature is nice but broken the device is well built and sturdy but you can tell it is an early product for it is time this device was fun to play with in the beginning fairly easy to setup but difficult to use everyday sometimes the swipes do not register and sometimes they register the opposite of what i intended there has no easy manual or tutorial either so if you do not enjoy playing with a new toy for a while to learn it stay away I have heard great things about the new smartwatch 2 and might have to make it number 1 on my christmas list,132,1
7556,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,here is what i bought this for i have 3 hours of cycling commuting to / from work i have an htc one x phone and i run google track to see my progress i also run tunein radio and listen to music using my lg hbs700 bluetooth headset i got it opened it hooked it to a computer and updated it is firmware i got excited at home and after playing around with it i found the plug-ins needed to do what i want it to i even installed the liveview charm that is supposed to help with the bluetooth connection i start my ride and run the microtrack on the liveview and google track on the phone start my radio and go the watch constantly connects and disconnects it interfere with my music on the bluetooth headset and makes it choppy and eventually freezes up by itself and puts me in a bad move for that ride at 20 you are buying a toy and i do not recommend it as anything that you can depend on for day to day operations,185,2
7557,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,3.0,neutral,i was very enthusiastic about this watch thinking that it would be the coolest thing since the atari 2600 but as it turns out it is not nearly as awesome as i had hoped i do not really know what i expected for 25 but i wish i had the money back the novelty wore off after about a week the pros it vibrates when you get a phone call / text / email / facebook update plus you can read your messages as well as facebook statuses definitely a conversation starter cons there are not enough plug-ins for it also the bluetooth connect is awful it disconnects if it is on my left wrist with my phone in my right pocket ridiculous it truly is a waste of money listen to me as i should have listened to the other negative reviews you definitely get what you pay for with this product maybe in a few years after sony has developed this more then it will be worth the aggrivation but as of now no,168,3
7558,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,5.0,positive,it is a great product for a low price and works great with my phone i use it all the time and the battery last for at least 3 days dontt have to charge it much,35,4
7559,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,5.0,positive,if you are the person who has meetings and do not want to be checking your phone every time this is perfect,21,5
7560,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,5.0,positive,the person that i brought it for loves it it allows them to see and respond to messages as they deem appropriate without pulling out their phone we had a little problem with the setup but after downloading some application setups it was up and running,46,6
7561,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,4.0,positive,i did not give thisfive stars because the watch wrist strap is pretty flimsy you also need to remove it from the wrist watch strap if the product needs charged i have not needed to use the clip yet but it seems more sturdy and can charge while attached,49,7
7562,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,2.0,negative,i like where this watch is going but aside from looking at my wrist to see who is calling or just to see what time it is that is all it is good for you have to snap it off the wrist band to charge it well after a month of charging the plastic wears out and there is no snapping it back onto the wrist band great concept and sony has made improvements on this watch with two more watches that i have not used but for thisit is a novelty at best,94,8
7563,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,2.0,negative,first charge was 3 4 days second charge was 1 day third 4 hours now i am averaging 2 hours per charge and it takes 3 hours to charge I have escalated to sony but i have to get a reply on the issue,45,9
7564,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,5.0,positive,had to buy this one for my other son because he loved his brothers watch so much theis nice does everything it said battery life are not the best but woks for me oh and the shipping was fast,40,10
7565,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,3.0,neutral,overall i am happy that i bough this thing because i was able to learn for a cheap price that a smart watch is not as useful in person at least with the tech that is out now the watch worked and connected with my phone once you download the app without any problems the watch is a little bulky and the band that it comes with is fairly cheap as expected the reason i is not as useful although is that any convenience that you would get out of the watch is lost because you have to charge it it also is more work to go through messages on the watch that it is to just pull out my phone from my pocket the only thing this watch saves me time on is allowing me to check the time without pulling out my phone this can be accomplished with a cheap regular watch although i was really excited to get this but was definitely disappointed with it i gave it a couple weeks for it to grow on me but now it just sits on my desk collecting dust considering it was only 20 i can not complain too much if you think a smart watch might be for you and are thinking about getting a more expensive one you might want to try this out first since it is only 20 obviously it would not be as nice as a pricier one but you may be able to learn like i did if you would actually use it i might consider getting a smart watch once they do not require frequent charging but this was definitely a good learning experience,276,11
7566,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,2.0,negative,would not stay paired with my phone the first few hours it was ok but after then nothing going to send it back,22,12
7567,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,4.0,positive,this gift was for myself but then it came around fathers day so i gave it to my husband he was so amazed that something this small had all the features it had but he liked it,37,13
7568,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,5.0,positive,it hooked right up to my lg spirit and although i had to go back and forth on a few of the apps to find a combo that did not restart my phone apparently the photo app does not play well updated the watch with the sony update program and runs like a champ other then the photo and facebook but I shall play with it a bit more I shall make good use of it to control my pandora when i go on my 110 mile ride to see area 51 on the 20th,91,14
7569,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,these are leftover stock so they have been sitting on shelves for a couple of years so most of them have destroyed batteries in them and the battery is not replaceable you charge it up overnight and then it will last 20 minutes before it dies this is because it uses a lipo battery that if let discharge they destroy themselves almost everything out there is a old stock that has a dead battery in it and will not take a charge or last very long i bought one locally and it did the dead battery dance returned it and the replacement did the same hoping that amazon had better stock i ordered one and it did the same thing all of them out there have batteries that are at the end of life which is sad because these things are so cool and far more affordable than the new 125 sony watch that does the same things,158,15
7570,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,2.0,negative,I am not sure i like sony products anymore goodbad execution i had this connected to with my galaxy note 2 it was fine the first day went to sleep next day the thing would not come on,38,16
7571,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,4.0,positive,after reading reviews i ordered the watch and did two things upon receipt 1 fully charged it 2 updated firmware it works flawlessly 95 of the time allows me to be less conspicuous at meetings or with clients and allows me to keep my phone on vibrate without missing important calls or messages,53,17
7572,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,the thing literally discharges in less than a minute returning it makes no sense I am not paying to return it nor am i paying customs charges a second time utter waste of money,33,18
7573,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,bought this after reading many many reviews all said there were issues with the bluetooth not connecting then one said there was a firware upgrade that fixed this so i took a chance bad choice did not work well at all i had it on my left wrist and my phone on my right hip and it would not stay connected and then to get it to reconnect there was no one way to do it in other words it would be different every time i spent half of the day trying to figure out how to make this thing work i even called sony they pointed me to a firmware upgrade one that i did not find on the internet and it did seem to help but it was still not working right they then asked what phone i had i told them i had the inc 2 i was then told that it would not work with my phone it says that it works with all android devices sheeeeesh anyway no good do not bother,176,19
7574,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,4.0,positive,device came on time with firmware july 2013 already upgraded no bluetooth disconnect issues at all i have not tested it with fbtwitter but text messaging gmail rss and android sys notifications are working perfectly all these is working but what was was planning to use it for is getting forex alerts to it combination of liveview notifications plugin and alert forex on cell phone makes it reality it is amazing now i do not have read cell phone screen just set up ask or sell price range and receive alerts on you live view overal it is great device that has limited bluetooth range 5 - 6 feet max but it does everithing as described and hopefully will do mode i think price is right and next model will have mode gui design improvements one more thing i rated it 4 stars because power supply is european but my whitepapers power supply has exactly same interface not a big issue i recommend it to everyone who want to receive alerts like stock market forex calendar email txt,177,20
7575,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,the worse thing i have ever bought i does not work at all i connected to my phone but did not work everything is unclear of how this silly thing works very confusing and uncomfortable,35,21
7576,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,2.0,negative,this thing is junk very short range to phone disconnects often reconnecting to phone is far more difficult than it should be in fact it should be automatic after the original pairing but it is not you will need to accept two separate pairing requests every time the watch needs to be reconnected the money you will save is not worth it buy the real deal sony smartwatch if that is what you are looking for because this junk will sour you on the concept entirely,81,22
7577,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,I had like to preface that by saying I am pretty adept with my phone that i am well aware of how to root the device install roms on it et al although i have elected to keep my current phone stock so the reviews that indicated that the device did not work straight out of the box did not deter me i saw enough work-arounds posted that i thought i could get this little device working and for it is current sale price about 20 it seemed like a steal if i could get it working but even as tech-savvy as i am i could not get it working consistently the bluetooth pairing would drop seemingly at will and no amount of work arounds could resolve that I have paired plenty of devices with phones before and several with this current phone and never had this connectivity issue mine is going back where it came from and i can not say that I shall ever buy another smart watch like this again,165,23
7578,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,5.0,positive,the actual watch hardware is very good the issues with using it allfrom the liveview app on the phone not the hardware this can be fixed by using the open-source app for it which had no stability issues for me the only two downsides i could find with it are that it can scratch rather easily and that you must remove it from the band to charge it can not tell time on it is own but you are getting it to use with your phone so who cares also it you are a nerd it uses iso8601 as it is date format,102,24
7579,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,1.0,negative,the only way this worked was when i kept rebooting my phone and rebooting this device connection would only last anywhere from 5 seconds to maybe about a minute rebooting both devices was the only way i found to reconnect returned got my refund i definitely encourage purchasing something else even when it was working the only thing it really does is scroll through different pictures of screens there has not any animation or real interaction you can do i wanted it as a remote readout for playing music but i did not found any way to make that happen really i mean even during the short intervals it would stay connected,110,25
7580,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,first can you really go wrong with the price of this phone case the inner rubber jacket fits very snug on the phone the plastic snap on fits easily around that but i got this one because i liked the look of it comparing this to my last otter box the rubber jacket fits better than the otter box this plastic jacket is a little bit more flexible than the otter box but it stays in place without a problem i would purchase this for my next phone if available cons rubber catches on pocket a little headphone jack cover is a but hard to open pros fits snugly great value charger speakerphone and more openings in correct place does not interfere with power and volume buttons,126,0
7581,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,i received the case yesterday i just took it off today on my way home from work the case is larger than it looks in the picture the phone is very thin and this case makes it bulky and it fits a little sloppy the mesh product is a cheap feeling plastic and all in all this products looks and feels cheap while driving home i tried to plug my aux cable into my phones headphone jack which is covered by a little tab on this case the tab is super flimsy and fits down flush with the rest of the case so every time i lifted it up it kept flopping down and i had to wait until i reached a stoplight to plug it in very disappointed I had steer clear,132,1
7582,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,it look like a great case but when it arrived is was the wrong case for the wrong phone what it explained in the info was not what i got a moto x case with flower print on it not all not for a galaxy s2 and,47,2
7583,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,this is a very nice case for the money i actually bought two of them the first one broke after my son tried to take it off the wrong way but that was our fault,37,3
7584,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,product fitted well and it wad delivered promptly but as other reviewers stated the case is not meant to be carried in the clothes except for jacket pocket or a purse is you carry one so i junked it and got a genetic plastic case,45,4
7585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,very brittle and fragile it broke and fell apart after some time,12,5
7586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,3.0,neutral,the hardshell is nice strong and durable but does not fit the phone without the mesh cover it will not stay on and continues to come off very irritating,27,6
7587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,3.0,neutral,i used this for a few months with much frustration waiting to find the seller where i had bought the hard case for my phone this case looks like it is going to be amazing not so much it did not fit my phone well when i had both parts of the case 2 separate pieces on the phone it would be difficult for my to use my power cord I have since replaced it and will not order one again i do not think this phone fits the skyrocket sii well,87,7
7588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,i did not want to spent a lot for a case on an older phone and I am pleased with this purchase,20,8
7589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,i had an otterbox defender case on my phone before this and since the rubber piece was on the outside it srltreched alot and i had to get a new case instead paying alot of money for that case i bought this one and I am very impressed fits on my phone perfectly and all the buttons and everything match up i like that the plastic is on the outside so that way it makes it easier to get the phone out of my pockets the only problem i had was the headphone jack cover it is kinda hard to open and it is very flimsy if i gets annoying il just cut it off but otherwise the case is better then my last one shipping was fast too it arrived within the estimated time so it was not late or early,138,9
7590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,did not fit tight it was rubbery and got caught in pocket the plug in cords did not fit with case on had to buy another case for phone,27,10

7595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,this case is reverse of the other cases hard she shall outside and the rubber cover cozy inside backwards from all the others but it works perfectly,26,15
7596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,i received a case that was not even for my phone it cost less than a dollar so it was not worth the hassle to try to return,27,16
7597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,this is one of the best looking cases out there but it is not of the highest quality after a month of use the matte black finish own the mesh part of the case is wearing away you also have to be careful when removing the case as the mesh part cracks if it bends too far for the price great case,62,17
7598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,fits great around my phone like the texture so it does not slip out of my hands like my last case did,21,18
7599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,3.0,neutral,i like the case for my skyrocket just does not provide the best fit needs to be tighter to fit my phone,21,19
7600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,great product for 68 i know right this thing has done a great job of sealing my phone protecting it and it is very easy to come on and off for cleaning seeing as how i am going to be upgrading to the s3 soon i did not want to spend too much money on this great case for the cash or cents i should say,64,20

7604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,the case is nice especially for the price about 2 but it did not fit my at and t samsung galaxy s2 as it advertised I am very disappointed i think it is designed more for the skyrocket it would have been a hassle to return it so i just kept it I am just glad i did not pay a lot for it this is why I am leary about buying things online without having to try it out first,75,24

7607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,i could not stand to keep it on my phone it kept bothering my eyes i loved how it looked when i first applied it but as soon as you go to use your phone it is very hard to read texts and more only thing i can suggest is if you bought the case already you might want to put it on the back of your iphone to use that as a mirror,71,2
7608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i love the mirror screen protector serves me so many more purposes than just protecting my screen it is a mirror laughing out loud,21,3

7614,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,it is really hard to see through the screen if your outside or in an area with alot of light it is really more useful if you are going to use it as a mirror,32,9

7620,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i love these screen protectors i have an iphone 4s and other than protecting my screen the mirror is actually really great it is not like those weird mirrors that you can barely see yourself in it it is kind of hard to see outside when it is daylight but what did you expect it is a mirror screen either you want a good mirror that looks kinda bad or a bad mirror that allows you to see your screen i do have a white iphone and it looks lavender purpleit is really easy to apply it is like a colorful screen in a way but i love it i no longer have to carry a mirror in my purse i just turn off my screen and there it is,128,15

7678,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,4.0,positive,great pros exactly what i asked for cons does not work in the sun / outside even with brightness all the way up and gets dirty easily duhh i also do not know if it is supposed to be over the camera or if i remove that part so now my pictures for my rear view camera are strangely tinted and last but not least there is a rainbow type effect but it is not too distracting i only noticed it the first time i am satisfied and the shipping was quick too,89,73
7679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,it is a really great product and the tittle says it all but i did not like how it kind of makes you feel a bit dizzy,26,74

7690,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,his screen protector is unpleasant and hurts my eyes while i used it on my phone every time i got a phone call it would be mission impossible to pick it up of press the green the answer put-on,39,85

7761,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,the mirror works awesome as directed but it does block the speaker so that it makes it harder to hear your conversations,22,156
7762,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,the screen gets dirty instantly and the mirror is not really that good do not buy it because it crap n not worth the money,23,157

7767,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,i ordered these for a friend and myself i saved one for him and tried one for myself after using two of them i could not get it to work right the top peeled off and left the screen sticky and annoying i gave one to him and it ended up working just fine,53,162
7768,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,the mirrored part is really cool but it makes the screen resolution very dark also the mirror reflects a lot of your surroundings,23,163
7769,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,these mirror protectors are amazing and the pricing is awesome you definitely get more then you pay for they last long and it is actually a mirror,26,164
7770,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,the mirror is not that great as a mirror the reflection is a little dark when the phone is on it is difficult to see the display trying to read the screen through the mirror was difficult and made me nearly cross-eyed i took the protector off the phone within one minute,51,165
7771,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,it works as a screen guard but I have used mirror screen protectors before by different brands and they were of much better quality in that as soon as the screen goes on you no longer see the protector at all and fingerprints would be very faint on these although when the screen is on there is a constant glare from the protector and a rainbow sheen that makes it hard to see what you are doing especially during the day and fingerprints and lines stick out clearly so i find myself constantly wiping my screen on my clothes every time after i touch it the price is reasonable although and i suppose you get what you pay for at least my phones screen is safe,125,166
7772,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,i have bought multiple mirror screen protectors over the years and these ones are the worst quality out of them all there are tabs at the top to pull off which should expose the sticky side to put on your phone when i tried to pull the first tab the whole thing was ruined the second side would not come off at all horrible quality,64,167
7773,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,is all good but you can not see a damn thing when you are outside in the sun is the most annoying thing ever not worth a penny,26,168
7774,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i would recommend this product to people it works great and stays on well mirror part really works thanks love it,21,169
7775,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,i like the mirror reflection indoors you can still see your phone through the mirror cover however in sunlight it is very difficult to see and am debating on keeping it on because sometimes i can not see anything on my screen in the sun it is a good privacy protector although elsewhere,52,170
7776,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,so mant times if i am just out to run a few errands i just put my phone in my pocket now i take along my lip stick stick and liner too,32,171

7781,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,the screen protectors i received were no where near what i was expecting it is just clear plastic waste of money,21,176
7782,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i love my new mirror screen protectors they are awesome now i do not have to buy a mirror for my bag,21,177
7783,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,these are not worth the money first of all they are not easy to figure out how to attach then they get so dirty and you can not really keep them clean we got 3 and ruined the first 2 trying to put them on then the 3rd one was on for a weekend until it started peeling and looking tacky,60,178
7784,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,fast shipping mirror screens are in brand new condition fits my screen nicely and comes with 3 screens for an awesome price love it,24,179

7786,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,almost everyone is asked to be on a team in order to solve a problem few are prepared for the experience the mckinsey way is a good primer for anyone placed in this situation for the first time because it simply explains a workable methodology for getting organized identifying the issues solving the problem getting consensus and going on to implement successfully a lot of this will be intuitive but what is not intuitive is what will help you you can probably best use this as a checklist to be sure you are not skipping steps if you buy this book to be your own consultant expecting to get mckinsey-like results you will probably not succeed drawing on lots of experience skill and smart people allows mckinsey to use this kind of methodology for best results but you will certainly get better results than if you ignore the methodology and few can afford mckinsey professional firms in other fields such as accountants and lawyers would do well to review this book to create a sense of urgency about having a methodology my main regret is that the book is authored by someone who was an associate for three years rather than one of the firms all-stars perhaps another mckinsey alum will be encouraged to share her or his views of the firms approach that would be nice for us all,230,0
7787,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,this is a thoroughly enjoyable read especially for a business book it is length is perfect for todays managers at 178 pages it can be consumed on a round-trip flight more importantly the book contains many practical concepts that can be applied to any problem encountered in business rasiel opens the book by providing insight into the methodologies and processes employed by mckinsey and co because of the secretive culture of the worlds most elite managment consulting firms rasiel shares the basics of how the most brilliant problem-solvers at mckinsey approach issues and shows how the reader can apply the same steps at his or her own organization the book also contains many business lessons learned by many mckinseythat again can be used by all whether you hire consultants aspire to be a consultant or just want to sharpen your business knowledge and problem-solving skills the mckinsey way is for you as practical as any business book ever read by this individual and i have used many over the years to combat insomnia the book is sure to remain close to your desk as one you frequently refer to again and again,192,1
7788,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,i found the book very useful and plan on applying the lessons in the book but i do not care for the authors writing style much,25,2
7789,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,it teaches you alot of good techniques for doing alot of diffrent stuff like the elevator test for your product or service,22,3
7790,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,the book gave a nice glance into what mckinsey does to make them who they are ethan highlights the values that mckinsey follows and also a couple of tips to help you improve your analytical skills,36,4
7791,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,a good but high level guide for those who want to understand what it takes and what is involved in problem determination and resolution from management consulting,27,5
7792,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,had to order this book for school but i could read it again a great book for school because it keeps you interested,23,6
7793,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,i got this book for 199 it is definitely worth that amount and my 3 hours of time buy i would not pay a lot more for it there has nothing you can not find with a good google search and the a lot of the stories do not add much value to the book,51,7
7794,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,enjoyable informative read that gives nice preview into a consultants way of thinking lack of more detailed examples would be my only minor grouse,24,8
7795,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,part 1 is great and problem solving framework very helpful but the rest of the book brings a lot of well known cliches from the corporate world,27,9
7796,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,good read if you are looking for a birdseye view of mckinsey consulting most of these things 80/20 rule theory of 3s can be found on most of the consulting review sites,32,10
7797,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,the author provides a good superficial overview of the process at mckinsey however it lacks depth to the point that it becomes a frustrating read the reader is often introduced to concepts and left wondering how those concepts would be applied in practical terms,44,11
7798,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,advice is very high level not exactly a deep dive into mckinsey practices but more of an overview of problem solving and critical thinking as it relates to projects i understand that the author was trying to make the content relatable to a wide audience but it comes across as very generic reader beware this book was written in 1999 methodologies and tools have changed dramatically and i do not believe there has been any revisions / new editions i would not recommend this book to experienced consultants but if you are in college and considering consulting then this could be a great introductory text,103,12
7799,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,some great insights into one of the worlds most prestigious companies,11,13
7800,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,the book gives good insight to the way the mckinseywork the language is very simple and easy to understand but this book is seems more generic as the methods and the style of working which is explained for mckinseyis more common to any other organization,47,14
7801,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,as someone about to start a career in management consulting i found this book useful the material is dated but the key messages hold true,25,15
7802,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,the mckinsey way is a terrible book and it is lack of quality has been compounded by how poorly it has aged i read this book because I am interested in management consulting and wanted an insiders perspective without a hollywood filter the author never addresses why he only spent 3 years at mckinsey and he clearly ran out of insights after the first couple of chapters nothing would be lost if this piece of writing was condensed to be a chapter in a career pathways pamphlet for high school students rather than a book the author seems to think that the reader should care that his favourite late night snack is sushi or that after consulting with many mckinsey alumni he discovered that people who travel should pack spare clothes or that mckinsey employees research using the internet this book contains 3 - 5 interesting insights amongst a sea of white space common sense and mentions that consultants work long hours I shall finish with a verbatim example typically a mckinsey team blocks out two hours if not more for a brainstorming session some team leaders prefer weekends for their meetings although this is not always looked on favourably by the other members of the team these sessions often run well into the night fuelled by deliveries of pizza chinese food or sushi my personal favourite,222,16
7803,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,insight into mckinsey some best practices applicable in every enterprise would have loved to see 1 - 2 projects in abymaybe masking the actual clent details manner this is were the challenge is all consultancy project are not straightward and very abstract,45,17
7804,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,if you are new at consulting it is a must in other case is a quick tip reminder in any case is a good management consulting reference,26,18
7805,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,as someone unfamiliar with the industry i hoped to gain insight into the actual day to day life and requirements of a prestigious consultant unfortunately i must agree with other reviewers in that 80 of the book is fluff i enjoyed the read on the whole but i suspect anyone with previous knowledge of the industry would find little value in the book aside from possibly skimming it over the course of 30 minutes i would like to also note that i was simultaneously reading druckers effective executive between the two i am learning far more from druckers writing and if you are looking for management lessons i would probably choose the drucker book over this one in a heartbeat that all said the book certainly has some interesting points waterfall charts and mece being my two favorites but save some money and borrow the book for an afternoon instead,150,19
7806,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,the book only gives a glimpse of mckinsey framework and severely lack any indepth insight you will not find any case studies or examples of it is usage,26,20
7807,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,do not buy this book the author can not stop talking about how many hours he worked per week no one cares we did not buy this book to learn that you worked 80 - 100 hours per week we bought this book for insights there are absolutely none he talks very briefly about hypothesis driven and mece but there is no elaboration there is an elaborate list of what you should pack when you travel as a consultant and here is a sample from that list a extra shirt for men or extra blouse for women b extra tie for men and he always carries his credit cards in a separate wallet this book is a complete waste of your time do not buy you have been warned,126,21
7808,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,good read if you just want to know a small glimpse of the consulting atmosphere i would suggest this a book to continually look to for advice or encouragment,29,22
7809,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,enjoyed reading it during my vacation was enjoyable and compelling i would recommend it to young analysts trying to grow within the organization but also to senior professionals willing to benchmark own methods,33,23
7810,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,i would definitely recommend this book to someone new trying to break into the world of marketing consulting whether it be a small firm or big reading through the book was quite easy and even bough it does not go deep into detail like how to crack a case it does provide tips that will definitely help you around the office as i was reading the book i started realizing how my boss does a lot of the things the book suggests,81,24
7811,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,as an ibm consultant it is nice to see what the competition has even although it is a bit outdated in terms of the culture that is painted in the book i would say the two firms are really worlds apart both in good ways there is a lot of negative reviews about the book however to me it was enjoyable taking in the lessons i can practice in my job and learning from history i look forward to the other two books in the series to me this is definitely not as good as likers toyota way however they discuss totally different things however in terms of describing company culture liker is really in depth i guess kinda like toyota while rasiel just scratches the surface kinda like mckinsey jk,130,25
7812,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,will read french up against english to see whether same story is coming through to brush up on french and storytelling,21,26
7813,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,well-organized book with a useful albeit cursory look into the world of management consulting as a mckinsey veteran recommended for any one looking to learn more about the field but not for anyone looking for the key to the mckinsey thought process in detail,44,27
7814,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,although this book is clearly targeted to consultants anyone can get the benefits from this book either by knowing how to steer a consultancy project to your liking or by learning how to structure ideas into a good communication using data driven hypothesis the beggining of the book is what will interest you from middle to end is just filler stuff no problem there it is written in a very easy way to read you can get it trough in a couple of days,83,28
7815,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,i found this book extremely useful the tools proposed are very simple maybe too simple for some people but they are extremely powerful if you know how to apply them,30,29
7816,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,excellent book that goes back to the basics one point to make it even more practical the book could prove some mc kinsey tools on top of the testimonials of the mc kinsay way of doing,36,30
7817,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,the mckinsey way is a great book for anyone interested in the field of consulting it sets out in a clear format exactly what it is like to work for arguably the best consulting firm in the world it is a fairly short read and i was engaged throughout the entire book,50,31
7818,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,raisel provides one of the most superficial accounts of strategy consulting I have ever seen and does a great disservice to aspiring b-school grads looking to learn more about the firm or to clients who would like to get some validation that the fees are really worth it instead of providing a detailed perspective on methods and approach we get some laughable frameworks that put everything in perspective case in point raisel notes that mckinsey recommendations are fact based wow what a revelation I am sure that opens everyone is eyes he spends the early part of the book that is a generous term here the text might fill a 50 page deliverable at best discussing the importance of hypothesis development and issue trees all fine except this is consulting 101 every consultant gathers initial facts develops potential rationales for the issues a client might face or an hypothesis then goes off to see if their thoughts are correct and finally develops go-forward recommendations raisel stays at such a high level throughout the book that there is no way to get beyond the pleasantries of base your conclusions on facts and adjust your hypothesis based on new facts instead he sounds like a washed up high school athlete most of the time recounting war stories eating chinese food at the office and working until 2 am every night this all gets old pretty quick although he tops it off with chapters on how to travel bring a sweater for long flights and how it is a goodto carry on your luggage to save time at the airport i really do not see how this book stays in print but i do understand how raisel only lasted 3 years at mckinsey this sort of supercial blather is just the sort of thing that mckinsey despises,304,32
7819,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,this is the first time i have felt the need to write a review in many many years of buying books on amazon i think most of the points raised by others who have written scathing reviews capture the crux of why this book is such a poor investment so i will not repeat them what summed the book up for me is the advice on page 148 of the edition i wasted my money on we are told that treating everyone with respect is possibly the best advice in this book really if you want to be told the blindingly obvious feel free to buy this book if you want to learn anything of any value that you will be able to use in the workplace you should avoid this book like the plague,134,33
7820,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,not much more to say other than the book has very little insight into what management consulting is do not waste your money and your time,25,34
7821,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,it was ok but i really expected a lot more depth in terms of problem solving advice advanced client management skills practical examples of ideas that worked and were carried through and more the book was arranged in five sections and really should have only been the first three and far more depth in each of those three should have been provided did we really need to hear mckinsey folk recommend that we take a toothbrush and an extra shirt when we travel the entire fourth act could have been spent elaborating explaining and going through some key lessons it does score points for it is every-man language and easy readability however,110,35
7822,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,on a positive note this book is a quick read on the downside there has nothing in here worth reading I have been in consulting for 8 years not at mckinsey but for the big4 consulting firms and now with a boutique firm where i frequently engage in strategy consulting similar to what you would find at mckinsey anyone who has been in consulting for even a couple years can tell this is rudimentary and no-brainer type stuff the level of depth this author goes into is pretty pathetic in my opinion and i guess no wonder the guy only worked there for 3 years mckinsey has been around for eons and this guy thinks he has the secret sauce after working there for just 3 years which also means he was probably at best an analyst or an associate the lower 2 levels clients pay out their ass for strategy consulting services from mckinsey to boil down the secret sauce into the simple rules and approaches outlined in this book is laughable i would not waste my time with this book if you are interested in consulting chances are you are at most 2 degrees away from someone that actually knows what consulting is about you are better off learning from that person,209,36
7823,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,within the first ten pages it is clear that the author is pandering to mckinsey without providing honest insight into the company or top notch consulting come to find out the author only worked at mckinsey for 3 years waste of a book unless you are beginning in business consulting even then much better books on the market should be titled consulting 101,63,37
7824,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,to provide better solutions for my clients i was looking for a book that would help tie together the many problem solving techniques i used in ge six sigmachange managementthis book really helped by raising the analysis up a level to better understand what the actual problem and business drivers are too often we apply six sigma ortools to a problem when another problem solving method is more appropriate much like using a hammer when one needs a screwdriver i highly recommend this book to any business leader that wants to improve her problem solving skills and her ability to look at business problems more strategically,112,38
7825,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,i thought the book had some good pointers if you are early in your career or just taking on your first leadership position overall i thought it was a bit simplistic and expected more if you previously spent any time in consulting you would recognize most of the book as good traits successful consultants exhibit,54,39
7826,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,after reading this book i would never hire mckinsey if any of those associated with the book showed up for the engagement you can get more business wisdom from chicken soup for the soul books my mom keeps them near the toilet for reading,44,40
7827,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,this quick read provides confirmation to the way consultants handle many everyday challenges what they think they already know but have never been officially told rasiel does this through short sections and chapters alike he cuts right to the chase i think this is maybe why some other readers commented so negatively maybe they were seeking out in depth methodologies or had extensive experience of their own to already draw from i enjoyed the bite-sized chucks of information and ear-marked many of the pages to use during future conversations with proteges i think the real key with this book is it should be targeted at traveling consultants with less than 5 years experience seeking to move up the ladder,119,41
7828,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,a good concept for a book mckinsey are clearly the worlds most secretive consulting firm however raisels interpretation of their uniqueness is somewhat limited by his experience for those readers out their who have worked in a consulting or professional services firm you will find alot of motherhood in this book which has been jazzed up as wow factor genius of mckinsey that said there are a few gems in this book too for those who have heard of mckinsey methods such as the hypothesis driven approach and the elusive waterfall diagram this book explains all,96,42
7829,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,i have to say that as a businessman this book is incredible i have reread it four times and i live by what is inside if you are thinking of going into consulting this book is a must-have but if you are a manager in any capacity you need to have this book in your collection you can apply these principles to any business and you should be there is a reason these guys are the best in the business buy this book todd hagopian president / ceo hagopian institute author of the popular quote junkie book sereies and the brand new idiom junkie series,103,43
7830,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,if you are wondering about consulting or implementation work read the book it is all true and not only about mckinsey,21,44
7831,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,being keen to better understand mckinseys formula for success i was rather underwhelmed very basic information which might be useful to a new graduate but hardly earth shattering check out the team building section for example the summary for which amounts to treat your people nicely if you want them to keep working for you on the other hand you do get some sense of mckinseys internal workings eg getting assigned to a project career developmentit is an easy read a few hours at most but unfortunately the true amount of useful information could be summarized in a first semester mba students 4-page book report,106,45
7832,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,i was expecting much more insight about what it is like to work at mckinsey for the most part i thought this book was a waste of time,27,46
7833,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,this is an okay book it tells you a few tips about how mckinsey works and the tools they use to get answers it is simple stuff but you can see why it works if you were thinking about working at mckinsey this book would be of great help they work new staff to the bones 80work weeks are the rule and staff are away from home all the time the plus of this is you learn an enormous amount about business it would be like being in the marines you can do it when you are young and then it is great when you get out,109,47
7834,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,the book gives a good overview on the strategies that are often used at the firm but it do not go much futher then the basic concept,26,48
7835,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,I am making the transition from contractor it field to consultant and i was looking for books to help me make this change this book caught my attention and once i started reading i could not stop i started saturday afternoon and finished sunday afternoon the book gives simple yet very good advice it is probably not advice you could not get elsewhere but the writing style of the author makes it very enjoyable to read and i think even simple messages deserve repeating i particularly enjoyed the stories from actual experiences at the firm i found them fascinating quite a few people have nitpicked the book with negative reviews my opinion is that they either do not have a sense of humor and missed the jokes or they are probably already above average consultants and therefore were not the target audience if you are not an experienced consultant or if you are an average one then this book could teach you a few things that make it well worth the price of the book in summary if i learned one thing from the book it is this any problem can be solved with a good approach based on hypothesis facts and asking the right questions,198,49
7836,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,this book is a good if dated introduction to the basics of strategy consulting in general and mckinsey in particular if you are interested in strategy consulting this is a must read it is very concise and generally well-written although at times the author can come off as trying too hard to be amusing it is a quick read and a fairly short book shorter than the page numbers suggest because the font size is fairly large this is a must-read not only if you are going into strategy consulting but if you are interested in high-level business thinking for example if you are planning to attend a top-tier mba program read this book i found several useful bits of advice esp regarding how to structure your argument or presentation especially the mece principle mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive overall this book is worth the read,146,50
7837,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,i strongly recommend this book to many of the people with whom i work i have purchased multiple copies to give as gifts and loaners the book is a very practical guide to problem solving concise communication and organized thinking it has tactics that anyone can use to improve their performance and effectiveness i have read many business books and the mckinsey way is on top of my list because it is so practical and has time tested wisdom,79,51
7838,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,mr rasiel has written a book on consulting for 3rd graders it is full of fluff and cliches at the beginning of each chapter he outlines it is contents in 2 paragraphs and spends the rest of the chapter illustrating his points with weak unengaging and not even remotely entertaining anecdotes his solution for a member of the client team who wouldthrough the presentation booklet at the beginning of a meeting and then tune out staple the pages of the book together gee thanks mr rasiel priceless advice here are some other gems that i found especially helpful no one ever said life was fair sometimes a little politeness goes a long way when all else fails have a doorman then at least you will come home to clean laundry the only valuable information i gleaned from this book is that if ethan rasiel is anything like the rest of the mckinseyi would last no longer than 2 years at the firm myself i found myself gritting my teeth at the nauseating tone and pointless content of this book save your time and read something anything else,191,52
7839,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,the mckinsey way is a marvellous and useful book that provides insights on how the very successful and world renowned mckinsey and company tackles challenges which are faced by their clients mckinsey and company is one of the first choices for the large corporates that may need assistance i am one of those that are getting started in the consultancy business and therefore found the ideas and insight provided by the author to be very useful and practical consulting firms and other businesses can learn from the wide range of subjects covered in the book ranging from problem solving team building interviewing techniques selling communication skills effective selling among others individuals should also benefit from the tips and techniques for effectively working and surviving in a highly pressurised working environment the book is well written in an easy to read and understand style the guidelines provided are simple and straightforward it is interesting to note the consultancy fees of up to 800 per hour that mckinsey charges and still has clients flocking for their services,175,53
7840,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,this book claims to provide an insight into the skills and tactics that mckinsey consultants use however it rarely goes beyond generalities that is you would find some business concepts that business school grads and many others would be well aware of not really the mckinsey way,46,54
7841,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,this books worth reading if you are a consultant or wish to become one do not expect the mystique and dark secrets of mckinsey to be revealed the way is quite simple and obvious to experienced consultants but probably what new consultants need to accelerate their technique the style of the book is a little frivolous for my liking in places it could do with a decent editor grammatical mistakes abound and some of the content could do with it is own medicine mece waffle and padding abound in summary it is worth reading but take note that the author only spent 3 years at mckinsey and based on an average engagement length of 6 months that means about 6 engagements assuming one engagement at a time is that enough to qualify as an authority on the firm and it is way and then there has this constant reference to one consultant named mcdermott should not he just have written the book himself,159,55
7842,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,i picked up the book with a hope of picking some cool fundas in consulting and was very disappointed i would put the book as a small collection of common sense and none of the methods to be really extra ordinary but as people say common sense is not so common one can just quickly go through by borrowing the book one thing i liked in the book is the importance of facts in consulting couple of points mentioned at the begining justifying the need to focus was facts was interesting,91,56
7843,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,whether you are a mba aspirant or mba or just want to improve your business awareness this is one must read the guidelines in this book are pretty basic but and gives you also a brief intro to mckinsey consulting firm and how it is works or the process it follows for recruitment,52,57
7844,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,as with other readers and reviewers i was quite disappointed by this book it does not provide the insight into the mckinsey company that i was hoping and expecting sure it tells you that they work very hard and burn out very fast while learning at the clients expense but it does not really talk about the company instead it focusses on how to do consulting i did think that there were some interesting insights into the way the company undertakes assignments and the structure that they apply to them there were also a number of other small take aways that at least justified the team in reading it just but if you are looking to learn about the company it is history and success then this is not the book for you,133,58
7845,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,as you probably know if you are reading this if you search for anything mckinsey or consulting this book is often at the top of your search results and as you also probably know if you have been looking for a good book on mckinsey nothing else promises what this provocative title does i read the reviews and i thought i knew what to expect many people said the book was filled with generalities and was not useful to anyone with graduate or real world business experience i took that into consideration but being a 2nd year undergrad i thought i should find at least a few enlightening ideas some people even recommend it as useful for the 16 - 21 crowd but i would charge even for the average achiever in college the book falls short of expectations and is not worth owning I had recommend skimming a borrowed copy although just to satisfy your temptation for a glimpse at the mckinsey way,158,59
7846,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,rasiel gets you with the mckinsey brand that is the real story here good job of marketing but the book is way too shallow to be of any use rasiel hints at mckinsey secrets but never scratches the surface my friend who works at mckinsey thinks no one will publish the reality the book may be interesting for someone who would like to get a romanticized version of what it is like to be a respected consultant but that is probably it the book is more of a feel-good rahrah than anything truly unique and inspiring it seems as although rasiel wants us to believe that mckinsey was the first to use the scientific method and engage in creative thinking his examples leave me dissatisfied and are too general in the end it sounds like he is sitting for an interview rather than exposing the secrets behind a well-respected company then again maybe he is looking for a job now in conclusion at least the book does not give any really poor advice and it would not hurt a younger read 16 - 21 reader to brush up on the tips he throws out,188,60
7847,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,the book provides an complete and structured overview of key elements of consulting and mckinseys approach it covers most important concepts and approaches on 1 how to frame problems 2 how to organise and run a project 3 how to present outcomes of a project and 4 how to work as a consultant in mckinsey as mr rasiel goes through the elements of consulting he unfortunately does not go in much depth for example he talks about running a project in specific phases but does not explain elements such as workplanning types of analysis or scope management in any depth he basically mentions them as important a key element that i believe is missing from the book is the concept of feedback and performance discussions consulting can offer the excellent learning exactly because it offers raw data-driven and honest feedback you will hear from your managers things you may not want but may well need to hear it is my belief mckinsey has more to offer than what mr rasiel describes furthermore the tone that mr rasiel strikes may put some clients and even potential employees off the feeling i got as i was reading the book was that senior clients are often considered difficult in their demands and client team members more often than not a pain to work with unfortunately many of the comments seem to confirm prejudices that clients have against strategy consultants,236,61
7848,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,this book is nothing special because it contains no revolutionary evolutionary business concepts that are unique to be sure it contains lot of good business anecdotes you will find in most business books but if you want to find out what makes mckinseys business practice so special and so much better than it is competitors the book leaves a lot wanting furthermore the book is full of generalities for example the chapter on interviewing for facts was nice but again nothing special you would be far better off buying specialty books on such matters i think this would be a good book to buy if you want to enter into consulting or are looking to work for mckinsey for others however the book does not break any new ground nor provides any brainstromy insights rather it is full of nice business generalities and suggestions,142,62
7849,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,possibly a good book for someone fresh out of school with little management experience or someone just assigned their first consulting type project any moderately experienced manager will not likely learn much from this book do we really need a list of things to pack for a business trip best quote remember that the interviewee client probably knows a lot more about her business than you consultant do p 84 and almost the same statement on p 80,79,63
7850,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,this book has some wonderful ideas and concepts one should read the book if he / she wants to know about any of the following elevator test waterfall model how to make a successful presentation do you want a mckinsey life approach mckinsey recruiting style more personal experience in this book if you want a better one try vaultcom how to maintain sanity while travelling on business assignments how to organise yourself better in the 24 hrs of a day what is the importance of simplicity in presentations how to handle people in a team if you are a team leader / working for a client / if you are part of a team mind it concepts discusssed range from arm-twisting politics factionalism corporate kicks and jabs carrot and stick theory and more etc mentoring and it is usefulness how to survive at mckinsey if you plan to be in there and kicking after the first couple of years this book is not about management consultancy and ethan rasiel is not trying to teach it in this book he talks about the way things are at mckinsey and how somebody can adapt to it / use those principles in his working life this book is about life in the topmost management consultancy firm of the world and is the ultimate insider to an employees life in it,209,64
7851,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,ever wonder the purpose of going to college when you do not remember or use most of what you learned at the very least you are supposed to have gained general problem solving skills this book titled the mckinsey way is actually nothing but a systematic approach to managing the most common problems you will run into while working in corporate america these are the tested and proven success techniques that have worked for the consultants at mckinsey explained in very simplistic terms if you have a college degree the chances are that you are already aware and exposed to a lot of these techniques nevertheless it is definitely worthwhile spending a few dollars to own a copy of this book the observations made in this book are those that are universal and do not necessarily change with time so the benefits of reading this book and applying these techniques can be very long lasting the authors writing style makes it very easy to read and understand the different topics presented in the book the chapters can be read independently and so can the different sections in each chapter hence you can read the book a few pages at a time and still benefit tremendously you can start applying these techniques right away so the benefits of reading this book can be seen immediately it may be hard to believe that mckinsey is known to charge up to 800 / hour for just doing these simple things but they do accomplish valuable results and that is why corporations are willing to pay such a high price for mckinseys consultants have fun reading this book and i hope you benefit from reading this book as much as i did did i mention that it has proved to be a great conversation piece,296,65
7852,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,the mckinsey way has a great title but the content fails to live up to it the book has 178 pgs but could have been covered in 60 pgs and without the bad jokes please the book could be summarized as 1 break problems down into components systematically 2 use facts but do not overload yourself with too much information and 3 if you work for mckinsey you will have no life do not buy the book just flip through it in a store,82,66
7853,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,this is a good book about what it is like to work as a management consultant but not a very good book about how to think like one i liked a lot of this book such as his explanation of how to conduct an interview i also liked his discussion about working late producing documents however many parts of this book were useless the section on charts basically tells you to read the book say it with charts and others were wrong the example used for mece was actually not mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive additionally as a consultant who did not travel or work very much at client sites rasiel could not give a complete picture of the consulting lifestyle in short this is an interesting read if you are thinking of joining a management consulting firm it does a decent job describing one persons experience but it is not a good book on business in general or even on the history of mckinsey,162,67
7854,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,like the firm itself the draw of this book is the mckinsey name and the perception that they must know something special content-wise you could do better with the user manual for your hp 12c calculator if the book serves any useful purpose it is to strip a little more of the paint off the mckinsey facade read it but check it out from the library because there has nothing in it you will want to reference later,76,68
7855,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,there is very little information in this book that would justify it is purchase interestingly even if the authors only goal was to provide an entertaining account of life within mckinsey he would fail basically there is no actionable information for the practicing consultant nor any material for a third party looking for insights into the consulting world or mckinsey,59,69
7856,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,this book is excellent in that it gives the reader an inside look at the culture of mckinsey and co as well as some practical insight to complex problem solving the nice thing about this book is that it does not have to be read in order but you can sample different sections of the book as the author explains like a box of chocolates truly delicious it is giving us the 80/20 rule which really rings true and the elevator test which are both great rules for any profession you also get mckinsey unique approach to problem solving as well as some great mckinsey stories also if you are an mba student and considering career options this is a must read,119,70
7857,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,this book is easy to read and a meaningful way to be more effective at work it outlines some practical steps to gather information motivate teams think proactively market services and ensure customer satisfaction although many of the ideas are common sense i recommend this book strongly for people who are paid to solve problems some highlights 1 after gathering the relevant facts segregate the issues so they are mece mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive this will help make sense of the chaotic data and help clarify the problem pg 10 in fact sometimes the problem that the client brings you is not even the real problem 2 use hypotheses and analysis frameworks porters five forcesbut do not fall in love with your original hypothesis 3 consulting work is not in a vacuum be aware of the internal politics and remember that a good recommendation is one that can realistically be implemented 4 to increase the customers roi focus on the main problems 80/20 principle and stop analyzing when you have the answer or you see diminishing marginal returns as the author quaintly put it do not boil the ocean pg 32 there are many others but let us not spoil the book,203,71
7858,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,the cost of retaining mckinsey and company is probably prohibitive for most organizations therefore when a book appears which purports to explain the way of the most prestigious management consultant firm it is certain to attract a great deal of attention and this one did having been involved in a number of strategic alliances over the years ones which also involved mckinsey executives i really expected much more from this book than it does in fact deliver i have the same opinion of it is sequel the mckinsey mind which i do not intend to review i recall a period years ago when the boston celtics were consistently winning nba championships at the annual all-star game the east squad ran celtic plays because they were the only plays everyone knew lombardis green bay packer teams ran the same offense and defense season after season while winning nfl titles what has my point perhaps what differentiates mckinsey from all other major management consulting firms whatever that what or way is can not be explained in a book and will only be revealed over time in direct and frequent contact with mckinsey executives this book may be of some value to middle managers but there are so many other books which offer more and better guidance ironically many of those books were written by former mckinsey partners,222,72
7859,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,hundereds to thousands of aspiring mbas dream of working for the firm but a few know what it is to work at the firm fortunately the life and work at the firm are impeccably brought to fore in the mckinsey way the mckinsey way of problem solving dealing with issues and the practices at one of the worlds best consulting firms are told in a most simplistic manner the book is filled with real life examples and the narration has a touch of humour the series of topics ranging from defining problem hypothesis creation to the techniques of data collection derving solutions to presenting the findings to the client are communicated effectively the authors stint at mckinsey further lends credit to the book summing up the book is a must read for a business studnet aspiring to be a consultant my recommendation a must buy for consultants and consultants to be,152,73
7860,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,i read both of raisels mckinsey books if you can cut through the mckinsey arrogance and the endless references to the number of hours mckinsey consultants work it is pretty good reading the books are written for line managers and are appropriately prescriptive and basic as an organizational consultant i have never sat down to write out my diagnostic analyses and outputs this documents many of the analyses i use and will help me better communicate with my clients these books will help people inis training and other functions who are looking to become value-added business partners collect data and analyze problems as internal consultants if another book comes out i will read it as well but please no more references to late night chinese dinners,128,74
7861,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,this book is written by someone who is more interested in portraying himself and the firm as extraordinary rather than communicating anything remotely useful to the reader unlike many excellent publications from ex or current mckinseythis one does no favours to the brand name of the firm pick up any good old dilbert comic book and you will find yourself more enlightened than with the mckinsey way,68,75
7862,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,to tell the truth maybe the better name should be the mckinsey methods because it is a book on how instead of why tactical instead of strategical it is not the authors fault well he is a person in mckinsey to consult for the clients not a person in mckinsey to manage the employees of mckinsey and not a person who guides mckinsey so you can learn how to do things more effective and more efficient from this book if you can integrate all the valuable methods into your daily work maybe some of those items are not fit for you it does not matter of course you can not put all of your hope on a single book never let a book occupy your brain but use your own head to read them all in all it is a book for those who want it to improve his daily work but not for who want to know why it is mckinsey not the others and more you use the methods provided to improve your life more useful the book is and you will feel satisfied with this book if you do not over-hope it,189,76
7863,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,ethan m raisel describes the problem-solving process used by mckinsey and company a well-known corporate consulting firm the book offers easily digested tips the insightful section on conducting interviews and the tips on building teamwork are particularly useful however because the author and other mckinsey consultants are prohibited by confidentiality agreements from discussing the specifics of their cases the book lacks real-world examples of the firms problem-solving approaches we [ ] recommend this book to managers seeking useful information and problem solving techniques,82,77
7864,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,i read this book this afternoon big print wide spacing the author describes the 80 - 20 pattern often found in work and life a phenomenon already familiar to most by which 80 of your business comes from 20 of your clients 80 of your time is spent on 20 of your to-do list and more the author demonstrates this chestnut with a book that is 20 useful and fresh and 80 no-brainer advice and shameless mckinsey advertising we are constantly reminded of how smart and ethical all those mckinsey consultants are all consulting anecdotes have happy endings unless the client screwed up real quotes as any good mckinsey associate would this young man applied himself tirelessly and diligently to his task or hank knew his area of the bank inside and out and was probably as smart as any member of the mckinsey team high praise indeed mckinseys approving editors have all the subtly of chinas xinhua propaganda agency trouble is many of us know people at mckinsey still the waterfall chart is among the 20 that make this book worth perusing but not buying,184,78
7865,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,what does this book give you a clear insight into some of the basic tenets of the mckinsey way of engaging with clients and solving business issues i would recommend this book to anyone who is new to the game of management consulting the advice here is clear comprehensive and concise moreover i would especially recommend this excellent tome to seasoned consultants who might believe that they know it all it no longer amazes me to find some senior consultants who either never had the firstabout some of the basic essentials or who who have become complacent and lazy over the years finally i would recommend this book to anyone in business who uses management consultants in a serious way other than to massage ones ego this book should give you an indication of at least the levels of rigor and professionalism to expect for your money so a great insightful knowledgeable and clear overview for the novice an excellent set of key reminders for the seasoned professional and a useful concise and simple benchmark for the clients of management consultants ethan m rasiel has come up with the goods and never keeps his eye off the great mckinsey tenets of mece mece and mece again regards martyn jones iniciativascom,213,79
7866,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,the real mckinsey way remains safeguarded within the steadfast walls of this secretive company but this book deals out many ideas that any strategy conscious businessperson should be mindful of i liked the bit of humor in the book such as the mentioning of the top list of things consultants make sure they take with them when on their assignments remember coca cola is not to be found in places such as czechoslavakia,72,80
7867,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,as the title suggests this book gives a birds eye view of the life trials and tribulations of the firm nothing earth shattering here and probably everyone can write one after leaving their company will we see more of the so-and-so way types of book after interviewing some more alumni but a good book to whoever to know more about the life of a strategy consultant and was afraid or did not know where to ask,76,81
7868,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,i agree with what the other reviewer was saying i would like to see more elaboration of the 3 principles but other than that it is one of the best business books i have read in years being an environmental consultant myself i could relate some of the experiences the author and the firm had a good read for everyone in the business,63,82
7869,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,1.0,negative,there is very very little useful information much ofbook centers around how selective mckinsey is which is commonknowledge there is almost a total lack of how strategies particular to mckinsey can be applied to solving business problems end,39,83
7870,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,in this book the writer puts you through a mckinsey boot-camp and shows what it means to be fact-based structured and hypothesis-driven however do not expect this book to provide anything extraordinary from any other management consultants methods and perspectives just because it is got the mckinsey name on it perhaps what the writer is trying to convey is exactly that a successful consultant is not just someone with the knowledge but the ability to share that knowledge in the most simplest form in assisting to solve clients problems the basic techniques shared is well-written and can be effective if well implemented it provide managers and business owners some guidance on techniques of handling problems and tough strategic issues for those who can not afford the real mckinsey the intro states think of this book as a sampler read whatever items interest you well that is exactly what it is straight and simple,150,84
7871,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,this book is arranged in many extremely brief sections each of which makes a point or two at a very general level a useful collection of approaches that a novice may find helpful but without tough case studies or any special insight into mckinsey i found the last two sections quoting the most important and the most memorable experiences of various mckinsey employees the most interesting parts read it if you are interested in management consulting and want a book you can scan in short sessions,86,85
7872,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,this book shall be useful to beginners / intemediates 1 - 3 years experience in business planning / analysis / consultation work it is simple not technical with ample examples about people engagement you can add on your personal experiences to make the learning more interactive and effective,40,86
7873,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,3.0,neutral,being a management consultant myself i found the book to be relevant but not too detailed for instance there should be more examples of the first 3 principles fact based structure of problem solving and hypothesis driven albeit this it is an easy-to-read book and it does outline the pains and gains of a consultants life with particular spotlight on the mckinsey and co which is undoubtedly an impressive firm it is a great book for the uninitiated who wants to catch a glimpse at mckinsey but it may not be as useful to insight-searching-people who have been in the industry for some time or managers in that sense,112,87
7874,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,if your looking for specific case studies or a drilled down discussion you generally will not find it with this book it does however give some good general guidelines for conducting research problem solving presenting and client interaction as with most general or somewhat abstract models this book provides general principles that can be applied specifically to your current situation for example the processes involved in data collection brainstorming issue analysis hypothesis construction and more can be applied to any topic in any area i found the writing style easy to read and concise with minimal amounts of obfuscation basically it seems to me the bedrock of the mckinsey way is long hours data distillation and thorough and exhausive data collection all told i found it a worthwhile read,128,88
7875,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,4.0,positive,the book details every important aspects of being a world class management consultant good reading and good value for money recommended for serious readers,24,89
7876,Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,2.0,negative,although the author offers a few unique insights into the way the worlds premier consultancy operates such as the thirty-second test where one has to tell his boss all key suggestions between floors in an elevator a two minute conversation with someone who has worked at mckinsey would do the same if not better the only true way to understand the mckinsey way is to hone up your interviewing skills and try to land yourself a job otherwise if you are only interested in business advice and presentation skill enhancement there are countless other books to read,97,90
7877,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,5.0,positive,it help with making public speeches it made them more enjoyable and entertaioning people really liked the speeches that we do after learning some of this phrases,27,0
7878,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,4.0,positive,i found this book to be quite charming albeit difficult to read since the phrases all run together even so i found it useful and entertaining,26,1
7879,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,1.0,negative,written in 1910 and probably appropriate to the time before the world war i before the great depression before the roaring 20s it might be interesting for a historical perspective but the apparent lack of punctuation marks throughout makes it a tad difficult to read there are some commas and periods but they are few and far between and rarely in the same sentence the only thing that sort of gives away the start of a sentence is a word starting with a capital letter not always reliable since there are some proper names in the text do not bother with this,101,2
7880,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,1.0,negative,of little use to someone writing in the 21st century paragraphs are long and difficult to follow unlikely for a modern writer to get any help or guidance,28,3

7882,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,1.0,negative,it did not seem relevant for the current public speaking vernacular might be more appropriate for the academic study of effective oration,22,5
7883,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,5.0,positive,this ebook has many great passages and quotes from history i particularly enjoyed the ones from early american history the tone and structure of many of the passages collected here make excellent studies for general and speech writing a terrific reference,41,6
7884,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,1.0,negative,an entirely worthless book a compendium of trite phrases without any discernible organizing principle,13,7
7885,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,3.0,neutral,it is a great tool for someone writing about people talking 100 years ago,14,8
7886,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,3.0,neutral,little difficult to read since information does flow well,9,9
7887,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,2.0,negative,this was not what i was looking foralthough interesting i am looking for format as a guide explanation was clearcould possibly be a tool for collge courses that require speaking abilities,31,10
7888,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,4.0,positive,many of the phrases provided reflect the original date of publication 1913 as i recall but it is a very useful tool and well worth study by anyone anticipating public speaking i confess that i took advantage of the free download for a cursory examination but may well come back to it,52,11
7889,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,3.0,neutral,it is good book in terms of the content but not a great read hope to have something which will be little more interesting to read as well as guidance,32,12
7890,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,2.0,negative,reading this format on a mobile device phone was not very convenient it is difficult to navigate and search for specific categories,21,13
7891,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,3.0,neutral,is it common in britain to stop a book at the point where all the loose ends come together this is the first time I have had to buy a second book for resolution of the first books plot line last time too i will not get fooled a second time,49,14
7892,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,2.0,negative,very confusing and not what i thought it would be it is definetley one that i would not buy sorry it was not a good book,26,15
7893,Kindle_Store,B000JMKZEA,4.0,positive,this is an excellent resource for public speakers it is only limited by the volume of content and the variety venues it addresses,23,16
8229,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,3.0,neutral,more about feelings and making a relationship m / m work than sex but not a bad short story just typing to fill in the required words this requirement is ridiculous,29,0
8230,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,3.0,neutral,this story was so short and i enjoyed it easy to read and fun like agolden book for adults,21,1
8231,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,5.0,positive,a strange yet cute romance was a good read 3 too short although i wish it would have been longer other than that it was a nice read,28,2
8232,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,4.0,positive,this is a 5 minute read but for all it is brevity it actually protrays a sweet relationship and has it is own little twist at the end it is a free download as it should be but on the basis of it i would look for more by cat / fabian black,48,3
8233,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,4.0,positive,a sweet little tale that probably made me chuckle to myself in all the wrong spots I am used to it as my sense of humor can be a bit odd and perverse at times the ocd cleaning had me smiling since it hit a bit close to home then i somehow got the mental image of an anthro wolf in a french maid outfit complete with feather duster stuck in my head the getting used to each others habits part of a relationship is always good for a laugh from me as well been there done that he and i both have that t-shirt the cover art is nicely done and the imagery and flow of the writing only had to overcome the issue of my mental translation from english to american four paws up,137,4
8234,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,4.0,positive,this two guys are a cute couple not your typical gorgeous hunk or twink but two ordinary plain looking chaps trying to make their relationship works a dom / sub style relationship both are still new at just a short story but the characters are three dimensional their exchanges amusing and engaging as is fabian blacks style enjoyable little freebie,58,5
8235,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,1.0,negative,nothing to really say it did not hold me and i deleted it after reading only skimmed it to the end as i was not interested in it enough,27,6
8236,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,1.0,negative,the shorter a short story is the subtler it is style must be to convey it is full meaning while the premise of this one is original and potentially good the author fails to develop his good ideas into poignant paragraphs the result lacks anyor humour,46,7
8237,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,5.0,positive,a sweet-sweet endearing story perfect for evening reading after coming home tired it certainly put a big grin on my face when i read it it made me feel really good,29,8

8242,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,4.0,positive,wish it was a little longer but a nice simple story the space wolves bit did make me laugh a little,21,13
8243,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,5.0,positive,peter and the wolf is way too short but it is free and a funny short peter pushes his wolfs buttons and gets just what he needs and wants and what he is looking for from his dom as he is forced to submit it would be great to see the story expanded into a longer manuscript and develop the characters fully,62,14
8244,Kindle_Store,B004AYDC6G,1.0,negative,a half star would be better or none did not care for it or any of these and hate being forced to review for bad pros,26,15

8248,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,5.0,positive,admittedly i bought this ebook after i already had gotten a few magpul items for my ar pistol build but the authors insight into more of the product line than i had considered did help me plan and make my pistol furniture purchases i would recommend this ebook to anyone who is thinking about building an ar rifle or pistol as the author goes over the different offerings from magpul in decent detail without going overboard and sounding like a commercial for magpul industries thanks for writing this,88,3
8249,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,1.0,negative,the author did fine and even inspired me but this should have been a write up on the web not a book in my opinion it could have turned out any of 100 or more ways,36,4
8250,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,4.0,positive,first look at the price for a buck you should not expect 400 pages on upgrading an arsenal next read a sample the author states first thing that his goal is to take a budget ar and dress it up for less than a couple hundred bucks taking those items into account the author does a good job at what he set out to record i gave 4 stars because this guide is exactoy what it claims to be a short and sweet account of how a guy on a budget used parts from a well reputed well priced company to convert a basic rifle into one a bit more tactical,108,5
8251,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,2.0,negative,this is pretty much nothing but fluff it is ok if you have not ever held a rifle in your hands but even a basic understanding of how a weapon works makes this unnecessary,32,6
8252,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,3.0,neutral,it was okay could have done more the stuff he did was a little basic needs more additional features as this was a little basic,25,7
8253,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,5.0,positive,short sweet gives one food for thought for some custom upgrades it was well worth the money now where is my credit card,23,8
8254,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,2.0,negative,you can get about the same information free from many sites on the web that being said the price of this book is not going to break the bank i do not regret buying this book just be aware that this book is closer to a lengthy magazine article than a book,51,9
8255,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,4.0,positive,well written to the point and offers some good suggestions for customizing your ar with magpul accessorys without spending a fortune,21,10
8256,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,2.0,negative,i wish i had my money back this was another impulse buy that i regret it told me absolutely nothing that a neophyte could not figure out i do not blame the writer for this i should have researched it better before i bought it,43,11
8257,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,4.0,positive,ok for 99 but short and not to informative for anyone who has experience with ar5s and has installed any type of mfg equipment,24,12
8258,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,4.0,positive,it is a good read not overly technical and good bit of solid info i would recommend it to anybody looking for a good understanding of ars,27,13
8259,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,3.0,neutral,if you have any experience at all with the ar platform than this will be of no surprise ok for a new ar user,24,14
8260,Kindle_Store,B004K6MH2E,3.0,neutral,it was worth the money gave some interesting insight into the obvious but all grist for the mill it does show that tricking up your scary black gun is not rocket science,31,15
8310,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,4.0,positive,having read a number of chris pettersens books including the superb tear in time having spotted this story i could not resist reading it the authors writing style is both accessible and engaging whilst up beat the tension is there when you want it and he always makes you wonder about what is going to happen next the story of a young man in search of adventure is one that is not uncommon however the author has made this one particularly engaging by combining mountain climbing with aeronautics there is a good deal of technical detail in this book that covers both the flying and climbing aspects of the story whilst i know something about flying light aircraft I am less knowledgeable of the technicalities of mountain climbing so i was pleased with the descriptions of the techniques and equipment used which were helpful without being tedious the story moves along well and this really is a book in three parts the journey to the mountain the climb and the return home there are times when you are carried along with the hero as he battles to keep his plane in the air and also when he is climbing the author successfully manages to convey the feeling of claustrophobia caused by flying in mountain passes and the heights of the glaciers if i have a criticism of this book is that it ends at 65 with the rest of the volume being taken up by the first chapters of tear in time there were very few typographic errors in this book always good to see from an indie writer,267,0
8311,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,4.0,positive,this book surprised me with it is grasp of mountain climbing and airplane flight it also contains a healthy amount of information about various locations in the world and all of this was woven into a very entertaining sometimes tense story very well written the book tells the tale of jack who wants to climb a mountain that has not been climbed before why because it is inaccessible except by plane there were points in the story where my body actually tensed and i found myself reading faster to see if jack would survive that is a good book although jack is barely an adult he builds the type of plane he needs to pursue his dream then he takes it on a long solo flight through many countries although he has very little money and subsists largely on peanut butter sandwiches jack challenges his skills and endurance pitting himself against a remote snowy mountain he has a number of close calls that will give the reader tingly worrisome feelings in the pit of the stomach or bottoms of the feet if you fear heights the author is obviously knowledgeable in the subjects he covers and he also has a talent for storytelling i thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more by this author,214,1
8312,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,3.0,neutral,it was a little short and needed a bit more detail but was ok for a bed time read average,20,2
8313,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,1.0,negative,this is one of most boring books I have run across in a very long time i do not understand the point of this story i brought the series atlantis and was looking forward to this read hopefully the other stories are better,41,3
8314,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,1.0,negative,totally unbelievable teenage fantasy should have died at least five times pity he did not should have frozen to death on mountain when he had the chance,26,4
8315,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,3.0,neutral,for what is actually a great adventure story some critical elements are missing like depth and interactions with other humans it basically is a monologue,26,5
8316,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,2.0,negative,nothing exciting i bought this book thinking it was about atlantis the story line is normal and nothing exciting unless you are a mountain climber or a flyer even then it is a tad boring,36,6
8317,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,2.0,negative,i rarely remove a book from my kindle or delete it from my library this will be one of them boring boring boring no point to this book to even remotely make me want to read the other two where does the it say this book is really written for the 12 year old audience note this one has absolutely nothing to do with atlantis sure he sees a golden triangle under the water big deal,74,7
8318,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,2.0,negative,it is the most boring book I have ever read if i want to read somebody has dairy i would have purchased a dairy,22,8
8319,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,1.0,negative,very boring reading half the book just flying to the destination i tried skipping ahead to see if there was any action coming soon but was disappointed never finished the book,31,9
8320,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,5.0,positive,i kinda started in the middle then read the first book that jack i am surprised i have any hair on my head if keep pulling it out i will be bald by the time i finish book three is there going to be another book with jack or is he going to kill himself in book three,59,10
8321,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,3.0,neutral,was n't to bad of a read i enjoyed it enough that i 'll eventually get around to reading some of his other books,22,11
8322,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,2.0,negative,an exhuberant amount of time just describing scenery or mundane details thecharacter has no depth and spends most of the book staring out of a plane,28,12
8323,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,5.0,positive,very interesting story i enjoyed it very much adventure and exciting a must read first before the next two in the series,22,13
8324,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,2.0,negative,too technical more like an account of a novice pilot on a solo i expected another adventure fantasy with a more complex plot,23,14
8325,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,1.0,negative,this was horrible enough that I am motivated to write a review of it pages and pages of repetition awkward dialog with the character talking to himself a bucket-full of cliches thrown in poor exposition of the technical details of climbing and flying and unbelievable crises,45,15
8326,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,5.0,positive,i felt like i was flying the plane and climbing that mountain very vivid description i will read the next two books,22,16
8327,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,5.0,positive,i read hidden courage before the other 2 books in the atlantis series because it gives a solid background as to the main character of all 3 books by the time you get through the first few pages of the book you start to get a solid grasp as to who this adventurer really is how he thinks and how he will react to stress situations it was easy for me to form mental pictures of what chris was writing about because he was able to describe in detail everything that our hero jack saw and did as one commentator wrote i found myself reading faster when i got to a particularly exciting part just so i could see how it turned out and if jack made it back in one piece fortunately jack does prevail and gets back home to the loving arms of his parents now i am involved in the second book in the series tomb of atlantis I shall not get into any particulars about this book other than to say that in tomb jack gets into a much more harrowing situation than he did in hidden courage i do believe that that boy has 9 lives and i do not mean the cat food read this one you will really enjoy it,215,17
8328,Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,4.0,positive,although i am a romance reader i enjoyed this adventure story the hero is someone who after reading the story i really admire a lot i guess you could say i related to him he does prevail in spite of many setbacks and i was glad about that there have also been times in my life when i have survived on peanut butter sandwiches thanks mr petersen for a very absorbing interesting book,73,18
8329,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,3.0,neutral,used this as a supplement for my server study served best as a last minute review / cram due to it is brevity book covers the comptia objectives pretty well test in back pretty good needs editing although many errors throughout so double check anything you are unsure of with another source especially if it does not sound right,55,0
8330,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,4.0,positive,this book is small but it happens to have about 90 of all relevant material for the exam in it it is really nice how everything was fitted in such a small package it is very good for studying and reviewing and you can easily google for any topics that may warrant further explanation the book did it is purpose i passed the exam with it is help the practice exam at the end seemed slightly easier than the actual one but it gives you a very goodabout the type of questions you can expect highly recommended for a study guide if you already have some experience with networks and computers 4 stars from me but 5 would be easily possible if it were just a bit more expanded and polished,129,1
8331,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,3.0,neutral,this is a very short guide if you are not intimately familiar with the subject material you will absolutely need an additional source to study from i read the entire guide in one afternoon seems to be a good review guide and certainly hits the main topic points such as raid types and general hardware if you are a person that likes to over study for everything or have not worked with servers frequently definitely plan on a second source of information,81,2
8332,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,2.0,negative,i can not recommend the book for 999 while it is okay there are not too many other resources out there to compare the information only lightly scratches the surface of what is needed to know to pass the server exam i was a bit disappointed I am not bashing the book or it is author as the author is clear that this is not the only study material one needs to pass the exam unless it is used as a quick refresher for someone who is thoroughly involved with server administration i am reading this ebook in conjunction with a printed study guide for the previous version of the server exam however in this ebook there are a handful of gramatical errors in sentences and paragraphs for example punctuation and these make the material difficult to understand in some cases i found things that i thought were absolutely wrong but mostly i think these were cases where the author was vague and/or unclear combined with grammatical errors or poor word choice or wording in all the author seems intelligent and knowledgeable but the final product is unpolished i can not recommend this ebook at 999 perhaps at 499 i would recommend this edition of the book it is a honest effort as it is and it would be a much better read if it were more polished,220,3
8333,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,4.0,positive,this is a decent compilation of a majority of the information you will see on the exam i bought this book on friday studied and refreshed my memory on the information in the book then did a quick glance on monday and i just passed the exam with an 867 of course i have over 14 years of experience but there were still some spots that i was weak on and this book did the trick there are typos and misprints in the book but not that bad especially when comparing to some of the ms press stuff the exam at the end is good but i found it a little easy compared to the actual exam some of the questions were vague and some of the answers had the wrong letter but the right explanation all in all this is the most recent material for the sever exam and it is well worth the nine bucks i spent on it,161,4
8334,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,5.0,positive,this book served the purpose i hoped it would i purchased other books as well to pass the test but i enjoyed this one read study learn get certified,29,5
8335,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,5.0,positive,jonathan lau just helped me pass my server sko-003 exam in december of 2013 with my a net sec and helpdesk experience jonathan put the technologies on this exam in perspective simple and concise many tout this information as the only thing you will need to pass the exam while i do recommend you take as wholesome an approach as possible i definitely think he has got the secret sauce to the server exam there has a notoriously small amount of material for this test they should just update it or scrap it to be truthful but mr lau does a good job at covering what you will need to know if you do not get this book to study for the exam you are doing yourself a disservice,121,6
8336,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,2.0,negative,i was disappointed that i was to the end of the book before i found something new that was not a stuff,22,7
8337,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,5.0,positive,passed my server using this book he covers all the notes needed to pass there are no server books out there that are updated server itself is an outdated exam / certification anyways but it is still a good one to have jon lau did a good job covering all stuff would recommend it,51,8
8338,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,2.0,negative,this book is pretty much just comptias published server core concepts document filled in with cursory information it probably works ok as a final checklist or last minute refresher guide but do not rely on this to actually learn any new material i bought it because it was cheap and even at 999 it was probably overpriced,56,9
8339,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,3.0,neutral,i bought this to brush up on my server certification i found this manual hard to read and found a lot of repetitive information that seemed to be filling space more so than providing study material it is decent if you need a skimming book to read while your significant other is driving you to your cert test but you need in depth reading material for your idle time i would not suggest this book i do have to admit it has decent practice test if you are needing one of those,91,10
8340,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,4.0,positive,i found this a very handy exam cram book it was short enough to read quickly and a few times over i made my own shorthand notes from it and together passed the exam although there were a few grammatical errors and at least one answer from the questions at the back was incorrect i would recommend this book as a quick reference guide for an it individual who has a good general understanding of it without full depth knowledge,80,11
8341,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,1.0,negative,this book is not a book nor a review for exam objectives it looks like a student with regular skills made a notes in his her notebook and than this notebook got published as this book this book as stated before by other reviewer lacks organization precision more solid material presentation has lots of errors i would not even buy this book as additional material just to go fast through topics before the exam looks like author has no experience in writing book at all this book has no structure and logic in it is contents bottom line not good as book nor as review material not recommended,106,12
8342,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,2.0,negative,the book does touch on most server concepts briefly as you would expect from a concise guide however it has many weaknesses including 1 organization it jumps around section headings often do not align to section content 2 presentation lacks diagrams comparison charts / tables and more usually expected in concise guides 3 editing beyond typos including use of wrong words as if author does not know what words like redundant actually mean such as a locked door with windows is redundant 4 content lots of content without context such as easier to implement statement leaving open the question easier than what 5 inaccuracies in an effort to be brief the author is sometimes plain wrong for example the author wrongly suggests that implementing a smart card reader and a key lock for door access constitutes multifactor authentication 6 incomplete a lot of exam topics are missing or glazed over with one sentence yielding zero useful information do not buy if you need to actually learn any of the concepts required to pass the security exam perhaps buy if you only need to brush up on terms measures and specifications related to passing the exam,199,13
8343,Kindle_Store,B0051OS0Q6,5.0,positive,it is a nice book regarding the certification of comptia server this study guide discuss in more depth about the content of servers and i recommend this book for people who want to pass the exam,35,14
8344,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,3.0,neutral,the authors knowledge of the workings of community theater are obvious and enjoyable unfortunately her knowledge of police procedure and mystery writing is seriously lacking she plays detective but washes the blood and skin from under her nails after she scratches her attacker she knows she is being stalked but continues to leave locked doors propped open wanders around dark places alone and more also the information the killer has could only be obtained through video but how he obtains it is never addressed the head of security a strong character seen in the beginning disappears in the dialog and is never heard or seen again the writing also suffers from a lack of grammar editing which is common in these indy books,122,0
8345,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,5.0,positive,kate is an exciting and lively characterthe spaz cam and graham are fun too the travelogue of downtown calgary adds a distinctive touchall in allthis is a great read,28,1

8350,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,5.0,positive,i was fortunate enough to read an advanced copy of this intriguing novel and i loved it i would like to take this opportunity to recommend it to other readers deborah nicholson creates suspense brilliantly this mystery based in calgary is obviously written by someone that loves the area the main character kate carpenter is a person with whom you can identify as a front of the house manager of a large theatre her life proceeds normally until a dead body turns up during a show and then like any great mystery novel although the premise would never happen in real life the heroine does not hesitate to jump in with both feet to investigate but you never doubt her ability to solve the crime from the beginning when the dead body is found to the conclusion i could not put it down house report is a real page-turner and an excellent read,152,6
8351,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,this could have been a great book the author is obviously talented and knowledgeable about the theater however the main character is annoying spoiled shallow and stupid if you honestly believed there was any chance at all that your boyfriend could be a murderer would you ask him to move in with you kate did if you were being stalked and had been repeatedly attacked and threatened would you continue wandering off on your own without telling anyone where you were going even although you have police officers assigned to protect you kate did if you were trying to find a killer and managed to scratch his face during one of his attacks would you wash your hands rather than let the police gather the evidence kate did if you received a death threat would you touch it with your hands and then hand it to 2 other people before the police arrived ensuring that any fingerprints would be gone kate did she gives her assistant all the jobs she personally does not like rather than splitting the duties equally or allowing him to learn how to do the job fully she has very spoiled when it comes to men expecting her boyfriend to cook for her and wait on her and give her rides everywhere why does not she have a car at 33 years old she has selfish in her friendships and condescending to her coworkers i really could not stand her some of the minor characters were entertaining and not so self-absorbed i liked scott immensely and nick as well the police were very unrealistic rarely bothering to look for any evidence at all there is a little humor and there are a few sweet moments but I am not inclined to seek out anything else by this author,296,7
8352,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,4.0,positive,good book especially for a long plane ride could hardly put it down want to read more of her books,20,8
8353,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,4.0,positive,the service was very fast and i started reading it is not as exciting as i would like but i wanted to see how it turned out,27,9
8354,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,i read this book from start to finish and kept thinking it would get better the style of writing bored me and the authors main obsession seemed to be the cigarettes the heroine was smoking does she work for a tobacco company i read to be entertained and this did not do the job i seriously doubt that I shall ever try another book by this author,65,10
8355,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,5.0,positive,i enjoyed the book especially since it was free the story really moved toward the end and had me going back and forth as to who done it,28,11
8356,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,after some time you just do not care about the plot i felt it was really boring very good before sleep time,22,12
8357,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,3.0,neutral,house report is a mystery about an arts complex located in calgary canada i enjoyed the information about how a theater functions and the descriptions of the scenes around calgary the heroine and hero were not very believable kate because she was so determined to find a killer and cam because he always seemed to be in the wrong place and the wrong time sorry but it was not that good,71,13
8358,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,i wish i had read all the reviews before i downloaded this book i am sorry to give it such a low rating it was just to boring,28,14
8359,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,3.0,neutral,i truly enjoyed learning about some of the minutiae required to operate a major theater and performance complex to me the behind-the-scenes look at theater operations was fascinating the protagonist left something to be desired although when a man is found murdered in kates part of the theater complex kate does everything she possibly can to make herself the next victim she seems to do everything possible to alienate her boyfriend her friends and her acquaintances and practically invites the killer to harass her just plain silly behavior from someone who supposedly has the smarts to manage a theater if you really love the theater I had recommend this book anyway if you prefer a crisp mystery look elsewhere,118,15
8360,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,i had to contintually force myself to continue reading this book to the end but i had made it halfway through so nonetheless the story was dry overly dramatic and had some of the worst red herrings I have encountered while some of the characters were interesting i would not recommend this book to anyone else,55,16
8361,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,this book started with promise but swiftly deteriorated to the point where you were almost begging for the heroine to die already the characters are unbelievable unbelievably goody-goody unbelievably stupid and unbelievably dull painful waste of time,36,17
8362,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,based on the average ratings i expected this book to be better james patterson and patricia cornwell have nothing to fear from this author i wish i had my time back,32,18
8363,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,5.0,positive,enjoyed reading an author i had not read before the plot got a little thick but still a really good read,20,19
8364,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,although it is very obvious this author has excellent writing talent this book needs research on police procedure for example the tormentor kept coming to katies office where the corridor was videotaped yet no one ever asked about or thought to ask about viewing them no finger prints were ever taken from victims skin there were so many loop holes in police procedures it was ridiculous i also did not like the heroine she was very immature lazy and silly at any point in time she had no clue what she was doing and readers could even guess why could have been a wonderful novel with a lot more research,110,20
8365,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,do not get me wrong i like fiction where the woman is a strong protagonist but i do not suffer fools or idiots when it is obvious someone is trying to kill her does she stay where she is supposed to in her apartment no she has to go on a long walk by herself when she is warned that this one individual does not like her and has it out for her does she internalize the warning no she writes him off as a harmless drunk it is very obvious at the end of this book there is another one coming i will not be buying it,107,21
8366,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,i really did not care for this book first of all it was way too long there was so much pointless chit-chat between the characters that i kept forgetting who the suspects were also the relationship between kate and cam was very frustrating spoiler there is no excuse for a man to hit is wife at all let alone to do it so hard that he breaks her jaw i do not care how the author tried to explain it this guy is a total loser given this i could not buy into their romance end spoiler kate herself was an annoying character she carelessly puts herself into one dangerous situation after the next and then is shocked when bad things happen to her the investigator on the case could not have been more ineffectual basically allowing kate to interfere in everyway including antagonizing the suspects and causing her coworker to end up in the hospital i definitely can not recommend this book,159,22
8367,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,4.0,positive,i liked this book the plot kept you guessing until the end i kept changing my mind on who the bad guy was the use of first person worked well for me and in general the characters were likeable the description of the scene was great i felt like i was there my only complaint was the depiction of a character who had gotten god it seemed a bit one-sided I am not sure if she was depicting a cult or just an average church-goer in her description i have not read this authors other works and so have noif that is a consistenti appreciate the more cleaner nature of the story all together a good read for one morning,122,23
8368,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,this was ok but there was a lot of heavy-handed writing re trying to get us to suspect one particular character spoiler alert so i am expected to forgive the love interest who hit his ex-wife just the one time because she had an abortion the author does not come out and say that this was justified violence but it is implied and we should believe a police officer would tell a woman that a man who broke another womans jaw is really an ok guy this part of the plot pissed me off a lot,93,24
8369,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,3.0,neutral,reads almost like a screen play some of the characters are confusing one of the main characters does something that is never clarifird that bothered me a light rainy day read best part is the detail of the setting,39,25
8370,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,4.0,positive,was a good read but a little over the top the description of the plex got confusing and i kept getting lost,22,26
8371,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,5.0,positive,i am a big james patterson and catherine coulter fan i was slightly depressed when i realized that i have read most of their books several times and decided it was time to find a new author as i mentioned above this book was right up my alley i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and after i was finished i went hunting for the second in the series although i have not read it yet i imagine that it will be just as engrossing as this one i am hoping the author is going to be putting out more of these kate carpenter novels,104,27
8372,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,after falling asleep 3 nights in a row trying to read this book i finally finished it it was way too full of dull observations and conversations that had nothing to do with the plot-the main characters were uninteresting and dialogue stilted sure glad i did not pay money for this book,51,28
8373,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,4.0,positive,the book was not a bad read just not very realistic as far as the police work and letting others do the snooping you think you know who did it and then you are not so sure i was a very anti-climatic end but for free not too bad,48,29
8374,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,1.0,negative,i got this as a freebie for my kindle and I am sooooo glad it was free I had have been mad at myself if I had paid money for this the plot was a clumsy mess kate was irritating unlikeable and too stupid too live cam was not much better in fact i really did not like much of anyone in this book and there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through i want to say that the motives of the killer were illogical except that really who would not want to kill kate after spending just a little time with her thank you amazon for giving me the chance to read this for free so i now know to never pay for a book in this series now can i get a refund on the hours of my life i wasted reading this drivel sigh,144,30
8375,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,3.0,neutral,never gave much thought to what was going on behind the curtain before so now a new appreciation for folks that work behind it all probably underpaid and under appreciated such is life life is art laughing out loud a very good story that could have been told in half the pages sometimes it just went on and on and on and such a tease if it is not ketchup stuck in a bottle waiting to drop on top of a juicy hamburger not worth the anticipation i like a book that i can put down and can not wait to get back to it did not happen with this one but when i did get back to it i remembered the story and everything that happened before i guess it is just an everyday kinda going on life read maybe your next door neighbor will let you know how her trip to wallyworld turned out,148,31
8376,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,i was going to give the book a 3 or 4 until the end the entire time the author tried to make us think that one person was the murderer so much so that it became kind of comical then i realized that what would make the book great is if that person was the killer because then it would almost be a surprise when it turned out to be someone unimportant for a ridiculous reason i was very disappointed spoiler ahead a great ending would have been cam as the killer and her winding up with scott,98,32
8377,Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,while this book was not a total waste it left a lot to be desired this story could have been told in at least 100 fewer pages the monotonous repetition about kate drinking coffee and smoking was truly annoying this author would do well to study techniques in how to construct a good first person narrative at one point i started counting the times she used the pronoun i and there were at least 8 on all the pages i counted i went and took a bath i made my 87th pot of coffee i need a cigarette i think my boyfriend is a murderer it was enough to make me want to scream all in all it was just a little too cutsie wootsie for my taste I am not at all sold on this lazy coffee swilling chain smoking no common sense having character being so beloved by her staff i think this is a fantasy indulgence by the author of perhaps how she wished her theater experience had played out the fact that there are more books that revolve around this character is also mind numbing i can not imagine having to slog my way through more than one,200,33
8378,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,3.0,neutral,the subject matter had real potential in fact great however i lost some of my interest and enthusiasm with a little too much side exclusions and sometimes not enough action intrigue about re the underwater action but still a good buy but would not read it again,47,0
8379,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,5.0,positive,suspense and excitement and all under water what more could anyone want in submarine book you will not be dissappointed,20,1
8380,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,1.0,negative,this was probably the worst book i have read since high-school the editing if you can call it that was almost non-existent poor sentence structure very bad spelling errors jerky story-line and more can not think of any redeeming good things about what should have been a good read do not waste you are 99cents,51,2
8381,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,4.0,positive,being a cold war submariner i try to read books relating to those times and boats this book grabs you and makes sure that you do not put it down i can relate to the story line which is very feasible and not far fetched believe me,46,3
8382,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,4.0,positive,nice easy read from a new author this is royal navy so do yourself a favor and go to the glossary in the back first so you understand the abbreviations the royal navy uses yes there are some technical issues but all in all a good read and an enjoyable evening with my kindle,54,4
8383,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,5.0,positive,choke point is a great submarine story if you like patrick robinsons books you will also like choke point writing style a bit different but a page-turner nevertheless excellent read fred auerbach,32,5
8384,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,4.0,positive,for lovers of action-packed military sea stories this is a gooder the author clearly knows what he is talking about so it is a good match of suspenseful storytelling and technical credibility,32,6
8385,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,2.0,negative,the story is disjointed the characters are never given flesh the story just ends it is like reading ana-sketch i would not recommend this to anyone but if you want a free one I shall figure out how to send it to you ken gordon,43,7
8386,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,4.0,positive,i love submarine stories so i am a bit biased however this book is a good read i like a book with a relatively simple plot and not too many characters some books that are highly rated are just too complicated to follow this book was easy to follow and was an exciting story from beginning to end it could have been a bit longer is my only criticism i will look for more from this author,77,8
8387,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,3.0,neutral,this book needs work reading it i felt as although it would be good to sit down with the author and go through all of the problem areas which were a lot but the plot was not too bad it just was not developed and supported fully by the story i will list some of the shortcomings i found the writing seems too abrupt not enough character development switches from scene to seen too abruptly the ending was very short should be lengthened factual errors in the book technical things were often passed over quickly and could use more development not like the over-depth that clancy goes into but more russian defenses were minimized sub went too close to shore captain left the bridge while they were in enemy waters little things perhaps but theof a military fiction book is to simulate reality not fully re-write it i did not dislike this book it was an ok read just not polished and it could of been so much more put this book next to one from the best selling authors and make a list of improvements for the next book i think the author has promise just needs to write less abruptly and perhaps less hurriedly and to work on his writing style character development and more i think / hope that he writes again i think that it will be better and that he can eventually reach a steady 45 star rating on future books if he puts the time and effort in,252,9
8388,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,3.0,neutral,a fast read jumps around between 3 submarines from 3 different countries some what hard to keep track of characters just as it comes together it ends with the reader wanting more,32,10
8389,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,3.0,neutral,i found this book an easy read and enjoyed the story but the book had a lot of simple miss spelled word i would recommend,25,11
8390,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,3.0,neutral,submarine stories are always interesting reading sea power and proceedings helps to understand what the author is writing about go navy,21,12
8391,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,1.0,negative,it was ok could have spent more words on the sub encounters what the disk contains is left more to the imagination that not,24,13
8392,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,1.0,negative,there were misspellings and typos throughout the book it appears the transfer to digital was not edited prior to letting your customers download it i probably will not order anything by lumsdon again as the story was short and had an unfulfilled ending it appears a good part of the story was removed to make it fit a certain length too bad because i like the genre,65,14
8393,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,1.0,negative,one of the worst books i have ever read no wonder it sold for 99 if the russians were as inept as the author depicted them the cold war would have ended in the 50s,34,15
8394,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,2.0,negative,on the one hand we were bored with the different british navy ranks and job descriptions as well as very technical descriptions of the weapons carried by the vessels and on the other hand we were supposed to believe that the british would use poorly coded personal messages to transmit top secret instructions to their submarines the fact that a signal officer who is simply a good swimmer is going to swim four miles in frigid waters and bring back a college professor the same way lost me i have to admit that i closed the book at that point,100,16
8395,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,5.0,positive,this is truly action packed story that is exceptionally well written and keep you guessing throughout the entire book i really enjoyed it and could not put it down,28,17
8396,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,5.0,positive,i enjoyed this very much i helped build sub marines for over 40 years and found the general ship operation to be very close to the actiallity,27,18
8397,Kindle_Store,B0057OAQCG,2.0,negative,hackneyed plot two dimensional characters you have read all this before and seen a million submarine movies with the same basic plot is there any sub story that does not have a secret traitor or spy on board sheesh,38,19
8398,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,this is a fast and fun read that i highly recommend i love learning about the male perspective when it comes to dating and maxs stories are hilarious,28,0
8399,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,this kindle single is about as interesting as watching paint dry the main character and his dates are pathetic and boring really a virgin until he attended college,28,1
8400,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,amazing read from first line to last i could not stop reading which even for a short story is rare for me great flow from one date to the next with twists to every one well done maximum,37,2
8401,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,remember the name because this kids going places i do not normally feel the need to leave a review on anything really but this is one of the most accessible e-books I have ever read a funny smart and unabashedly insightful look on what may possibly represent each subdivision of the female dating pool and murky waters they are at least according to maximum lance maybe it is the fact i who also was scared shitless by the media mostly into having sex so much as to delay the escapades of wonderful one-night stands until mid-college bonded so well with each individual vignette of sorts that i took comfort in realizing it is not me who has insane but others nice to have that confirmation finally someone out there who tells it like it is without the kerouac bull that plagued so may generations of creatives best money you will spend this year unless you find that rare gem at the strip club who will give you 15 minutes of booth time for a dollar only question now is when lance will translate his conquests to a longer-form of socio-realistic literature,187,3
8402,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,what could easily be just a bunch of funny stories about crazy dates is in fact a great look at why we date who we do what works and does not work in a relationship and what ultimately dating should be about it is got lots of comedy no doubt but even the crazy girls in the story are usually given their due as fully realized and sympathetic people who are acting the way they are for a reason great hour read to pass a lunch break or a train ride,89,4
8403,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,i gather lance is in his twenties and it may be the kiss of death for his literary fortunes to know that this mini-memoir resonates with those of us in the coveted 65-to-death demographic but that is life lance is a fearless writer who is not afraid to reveal himself warts and all so much so that one hopes his parents are no longer living his tales of dates from he shall are the kind of thing that no parent would want to read but that every parent or at least every father will recognize from his own past nice to know that for all the much-vaunted changes wrought by that long-ago sexual revolution the mating game is still as painful and hilarious as i remember it,125,5
8404,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,by a guy who clearly has some dating fiascos and a sense of humor so we can be let in on the fun in his intro he describes a girl with cocaine under her pillow a cutter a bulemic and one who expected him to fight a guy and yet these were not the stories featured he had better ones some of the crazy has a streak of sad underneath that people are how they are but the storytelling is what makes it a good read very enjoyable with a few insightful comments thrown in for good measure a nice short diverting read recommended jtg,101,6
8405,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,lance is an amazingly funny writer and the book had me laughing out loud perfect kindle book for bringing on the subway and examining the women around me wondering what secret craziness lurks beneath their normal-seeming exteriors if you are looking for a solidly written hilarious read pick this one up,50,7
8406,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,great I am writing this review so that will let me escape and go onto the book that i really want to read okay bye good luck,25,8

8408,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,sounds like it is written by a frustrated bacheler i would not recommend this book to anyone,17,10
8409,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,it was ok for a quick read the stories were cute but nothing that made me laugh out loud it was perfect for a boring day at work,28,11

8425,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,did you enjoy this sample no well wait yes thank you for the 99 i saved by seeing good reason not to go with 4 and 5 star reviews written by someone who professes to be a comedian sounds mentally off balanced to put it kindly,45,27
8426,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,it is so choppy and did not hold my attention i think i was expecting something more amusing and in a better told story,23,28

8428,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,i thought this book was going to be really funny but mostly the author just complained about bad dates i was not overly impressed,23,30
8429,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,short story not as crazy as the title suggests author attempts to be self depricating and humorous but it falls flat would not recommend,24,31
8430,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,some war stories from the dating frontier the author has an enjoyable familiar writing voice and it is fun to hear him give the lowdown on some of his dating disasters nothing very enduring however,34,32
8431,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,i saw that with this book how guys really evaluate their lives with the women they encounter through out a life time it is a trial and error that is until they meet the one they will be with the rest of their lives,42,33
8432,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,boring and flat never funny never insightful just one self-centered jerk with no sense of writing style at all what a waste of 99 cents,25,34
8433,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,i did not really know what to make of this when i finished the main problem i had with it was that it was poorly written no grammatical structure at all and sometimes i did not know who was talking or who was doing what also the girls who were supposedly crazy were really just irritated at him i would have been too sure some of the girls were a little off but i do not know okay that all having been said i did finish it it did keep my interest somewhat would i read it again no,96,35
8434,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,great short read i can not understand the negative reviews loved mr lances sense of humor I had love to read more by him think that you just got to get his dry self-deprecating sense of humor it is a kindle single so if you pay 99 cents for it then do not expect a novel please read this enjoy and do not take yourself too seriously,63,36
8435,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,theis not a bad one at all describe catastrophic dates with a light humoristic satiric tone but each story feels like a draft of it is future version too short and in the end fairly repetitive there has not enough substance here,43,37
8436,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,the real crazy girls are rather talented i hope maximum did them justice one star for the recognition i might come back tomorrow to buy gripping intro,27,38
8437,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,hard to understand why this booklet gets an average to good rating it is not funny and not interesting either the writing is flat the plot of the 8 short stories / dates mostly documents the inability of the narrator to relate to his dates as human beings who certainly have their failings but do not seem that crazy it would require much more talent than this writer has to make it acceptable to call crazy a girl who has problems because she was raped please do not give it your 99 cents and your time,94,39
8438,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,i agree with loredana flat and boring covers it for me i can not believe there are readers who enjoyed this i want my 99 cents back,26,40
8439,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,4.0,positive,this was a fun short to read i liked it mainly because i could relate to those first dates and the craziness of them i laughed out loud several times this is one i would recommend to my single friends,38,41
8440,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,if you are expecting something spectacular here you are forgetting that you get what you pay for if you are looking for a short mildly entertaining read this should keep you busy for about an hour,35,42
8441,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,overall this book was pretty disappointing first of all it was short his whole novel about all the crazy girls he has dated and there are what eight date stories ten tops plus i think this man has a skewedof crazy women he introduces the book as although he has really dated some weirdos and you are expecting crazy drunks total idiots and maybe some cult followers instead you get a girl who is cool and yet gasp christian then several girls who are emotionally wounded I am talking girls who have been seriously victimized not silly girls who think a chipped pedicure is an apocalypse sure maybe some of these girls should not have unloaded on the first date but you can not blame them for having skeletons in their closets and finally a couple girls who maybe really did have some problems still most of these can be summed up into a bad breakup a lot of stress or maybe pms either way if this guy thinks all of those girls are crazy he will have a hard time finding someone who has not and then there has the actual writing it is not horrible it is not the best but for a comedian there should be more jokes less rambling and fewer bits about the hotness of the few girls you thought it might actually work out with it does not flow it is not organized and it needs some serious fleshing out before it is a real book,240,43
8442,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,i read about how hilarious the book was and bought it for a nice summer reading but it actually made me cry i even found disgusting the fact that some stories were based on suffering women who were raped or whose mother was killed i did not find it funny and had a hard time to keep reading after a while i understand why the price is 099,67,44
8443,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,4.0,positive,i read this in less than an hour but it made me laugh out loud as a woman I am not offended but if you are sensitive this probably will not be your favorite,31,45
8444,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,4.0,positive,interesting in a funny and depressing way where did he find these freaks really we all have our baggage some more some less but jeez there is such a thing asat the very least i am more happy to not be dating anymore than i was before this singles scene refresher course I am not sure what the one star reviewers were expecting here some sort of revelation about women,70,46
8445,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,boring flat uninspiring and these are the good things i can say about this book i will refrain to comment on the negative there is no life in the writing style no inspiration in the stories no memorable moments there is no comedy no drama no lessons no fun i am sure that the rest of the reviewers are part of the authors family because otherwise i can not understand how somebody would find this pseudo-book interesting at all how can i get my money back how about my wasted time,90,47
8446,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,crazy girls kept me wanting to read more and more this single is so funny i could not stop reading it maximum makes you feel like you were right there with him on the date i wish it was longer,39,48
8447,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,based on the description and the reviews i expected to read about several first dates gone wrong from a comedic standpoint comedy you dig this book read more like a thinly veiled homage to the author who tried to be quirky and humble but I am going to came off like a jerk victims of rape and the family of murder victims might have legitimate reasons for emotional imbalance crazy hmm given his seemingly extensive repertoire of dates he made odd choices to write about for a comedic short I had be hard pressed to find something worse that I have wasted 1 and 20 minutes on,102,49
8448,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,believable story of a mans misadventures of dating in his twenties it is good to know that the other half of society has the same problems with dating i personaly am so happy the author chose the title crazy girls because many men i know would have went for crazy b s i could not help but cast this story into a movie as a met each new character so here goes my dream line up a dorky luke wilson as maximum taryn manning as ingrid zooey deshchanel as devon alex meneses as nina brittany snow as lauren mila kunis as tracy and alexis biedel as jen i would love to know how far off my casting is from the truth,118,50
8449,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,i was expecting since the writer is a comedian that this would be funny it was not i could not wait to finish reading it so i could get on to something else,31,51
8450,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,as a 20-something male whose never been on a single date with a woman before do not ask I am always curious to read the real-life dating experiences of others crazy girls while pretty funny and easy to read just did not have enough substance for me i felt like i was watching a sitcom about dating starring matthew perry,58,52
8451,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,the book was okay most of the stories were just sad for 99 cents i can not complain i thought it would have been more funny,27,53
8452,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,i read the description and thought that this could be an entertaining read but was greatly disappointed stopped halfway through it is simply not fun the author tries too hard everything is black or white there are no nuances no subtleties no insigts the story is like a stand-up comedy script which may be fun on stage but not off stage especially in writing,64,54
8453,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,this book is fantastic a trip down memory lane who has not endured the joys miseries and angst of dating but this is an up-to-the-minute tale that reveals the pleasures and pitfalls of the current dating scene grab a glass of wine or a beer sit back and chuckle at the crazy predicaments that our hero finds himself in perfect summer reading,61,55
8454,Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,crazy girls makes you laugh out loud and breaks your heart at the same time maximum lance is both naively funny and wickedly insightful as he travels the terrorfying world of relationships looking for love sex or a second date his uncensored point of view is hilarious loved it,49,56

8492,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,2.0,negative,there are too many disjointed parts to these stories it is as if the sex were written and someone thought other things should be added but no one knew what so random phrases were put in such as one lady who says she is helping people through my work but what does she do no one tells you the sensual parts are well enough written but leave you wondering how the protagonist got there as the story really does not suit such activity these are just disjointed sex scenes and the parts in the middle are so annoying they ruin even the sex the non sex parts are terrible and this ruins all the rest which is a shame,120,37

8525,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,the short stories stunk i did not like the plots which they really did not have much of one and the content was of no interest,26,70
8526,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,the only thing this had going for it was the free price tag i skimmed through the whole thing looking for the hot sex scenes and never really found any i deleted it first chance i got do not waste your time,41,71

8528,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,i read two stories and found this not very interesting at all stories were long and not very discriptive in the least,22,73

8531,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,this book was just boring and i did not enjoy it at all it was very disjointed and was not even very erotic thank god it was free otherwise i would have wasted good money,33,76
8532,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,5.0,positive,i liked this book although i am ashamed to admit it i found it humorous because sex is really not like it is portrayed in the book it was a good book,32,77
8533,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,2.0,negative,many of the stories were weird they were not very erotic even when they did contain sex they all seemed to really be about woman sexual liberation the modern cover suggests a modern read but they all seem to be very old fashioned settings too,45,78
8534,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,4.0,positive,despite being more directed at a female audience it was still pretty good the stories were good and the excellent writing kept me hooked and you simply can not argue with the price all in all it was a pretty decent book,41,79
8535,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,5.0,positive,this is a great collection of erotic stories if you read erotica then you will really enjoy this series the writing is spectacular i highly recommend this book and the authors,30,80
8536,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,inane and trashy lacks a coherent narrative do not bother with this one i should have known better than to ask for it,22,81

8538,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,3.0,neutral,entertaining but not too serious just enough erotica that a married woman needs it will stir emotions that you may have forgotten you once had,25,83
8539,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,5.0,positive,this amazing collection of erotic stories is one of the best I have read so far in any format print or otherwise the stories here do not just sizzle they burn and in some cases they burn enough to expose some surprising aspects of human nature if you read erotica regularly you know that some talk purely about sex the kind that makes people refer to erotica as porn and some use erotic language or stories to transcend that and talk about love and life this collection is the latter i particularly loved the last story it was hot quick and surprisingly poignant if there has any free erotica worth getting this should be it do not hesitate and press that button now highly recommended,123,84
8540,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,short stories were stupid and some almost juvenile sex with a chocolate dildo glad this was free and i did not pay for it i deleted it without finishing it,29,85
8541,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,people seem to be attracted to reading pornography because it is often excused as not evil due to the spiritual ignorance of the masses for most people think of pornography as a movie or picture that involves ongoing copulation or even as softcore as removing the little blackouts from off the nipples well allow me to correct this ignorance fornication involves more than this for our lord jesus christ describes to look on a woman to lust after her is to commit adultry with her in the heart now take this same concept and consider your wicked immagination lusting after delights that are not your own nor should be do not covet is the command so consider getting your own husband or your own wife and not burn in your lusts for it is better to marry than to burn if your are one who takes pleasure in reading erotica or should i say pornography you should consider this in the same wicked fashion as a whorish movie or some prostitution house in the slums of town it is as although a man would walk into a strip club and desperately empty his wallet just to be let down and empied of his soul in the end these pornographic stories do nothing more than excite the lusts of your flesh and seperate you further from the god who created you to glorify him through holy living jesus christ can redeem you and save you call upon his name to be saved cry out for his mercy in the depths of your darkness for this purpose he was sent down unto us so that we can be set free of the bondage of sin [ ] turn from idolatry eroti is a false god [ ],293,86
8542,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,4.0,positive,very entertaining good storylines and kept me engaged definitely recommend if you want sentilating erotica and not porn that is zane,20,87
8543,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,1.0,negative,i read everything everything and i could not read this i want my one star back it was muddled and confusing and overwrought random magic and no established time period and that was the first chapter seriously I am really sorry mr stern because i know you are a real person with feelings but this is just bad get a vicious editor and try again,63,0
8544,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,i had never read anything by this author before but i found this novel free on kindle and decided to give it a shot it is a short read about 64 pages but it is a terrific story it blends science fiction with fantasy and it is unlike anything i have ever read i am not a huge sci fi fan normally so i am always pleasantly surprised when i find something that appeals to me the fantasy world exists perfectly alongside the real world and makes for a fantastically interesting story even more interesting to me is that the author is a man and writes such strong and real female characters he captures the strong but vulnerable aspect that i enjoy in realistic women characters the mix of mystery magic and science fiction was wonderful i have seen this book listed in some places as the start of a series and i truly hope that is the case,158,1
8545,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,quite enjoyed this book nice easy read nothing too in depth that you makes go what the would recommend it,20,2
8546,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,2.0,negative,the book was magical i like that everything is straight to the point there could have been more detail on magical creatures rocks spells and covens overall an enchanting short story,30,3
8547,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,for centuries the witches have controlled the power of magic they have travelled between the worlds and used their ' gifts freely but now a wizard has rising and challenging their powers one by one three young witches have disappeared with notes left behind in their place it was as if the wizard was mocking the witches the council decides and sends six of their best to find and kill this wizard with other dead or captured or injured it falls on tiffany to take care of the business herself she is the strongest witch of their generation and turns out to be the only hope that her people could have of survival this is an action packed novella of some 55 odd pages there has a lot in those few pages we learn a lot about the different worlds how the witches council works and how the witches themselves live their lives there is a lot of action emotion and drama there has also a matter of domestic violence handled in this book phil sterns writing style in unquestionably amazing few days back i had the chance to read and review another book of his and although the plots of both the books are very different two things about his writing has turned out to be consistently good his writing style and his characters i loved them both,228,4
8548,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,3.0,neutral,this book is about a coven of witches who basically prey on human normal men in order to basically breed definitely a unique concept and an interesting one then a very powerful wizard begins attacking and kidnapping witches they are shocked because it is believed that only females have powers so a group of powerful young witches is sent out to track him down and dispatch of him i enjoyed the plot of this book and the characters as well the only real disappointment to me was the ending it was so abrupt i had noi was that close to the end i use a reader and rarely check to see my progress in a book esp if I am really into it i would have liked to know about how things turned out for some of the characters involved but it was almost open for a sequel if phil stern does write a sequel i would definitely read it i gave this book 3 stars,167,5
8549,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,phil stern is an unusual author if you did not know that his name was phil and he was a man it would be easy to think he was a female as his writings often have female leads and he is in tune with that strong yet vulnerable side women really want to see in female leads you know this is true when you are alone at home you yell at the foolish girls in movies that go into dark basements with no weapons and die or have to be rescued wonder why anyone would go into the woods on a hike in skimpy clothing and high heels and bemoan the weak woman who needs to be rescued real women are strong weak vulnerable powerful and use all of that to take care of themselves and everyone around them this is what tiffany does in witches she has had a rough life we find out but she does not whine or blame anyone she works hard to help others and she is more powerful that you would think phil stern brings this world to life and makes you want to get in there and help tiffany not because she needs it but because she brings out that quality in you i enjoyed this book i read it in one sitting and was totally amazed to find that time had passed while i was in this other world my only complaint was that the story ends with characters that had not been introduced before and i was really confused by it i am going to hope that as i read more i can connect these character in another book to help me come to some sense as to why they suddenly showed up i give this 4 out of 5 clouds,298,6
8550,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,the more books i read that are fantasy based the more i realize it is a genre I have been missing out on for a while witches conveys in great dialogue and smooth flowing descriptions another world that is in chaos it is also the second volume in phil stern unbridled boundary series a young witch finds her world is threatened by a wizard who is trying to claim power over the witches and destroy the most powerful the witch must also face her own family issues that she has yet to deal with i want to begin by saying that the writing has a very nice flow to it you can get lost in the words by reading it because the words string together so smoothly the writing was perhaps my favorite thing about this novella the characters are also very complex there are many layers as to why they feel compelled to do the things they do even the evil wizard the book features a huge cast of characters from a variety of walks of life and the reader can almost find something to identify with any of them if you are looking for an action packed fantasy then this is the book you have been seeking it keeps you intently interested from beginning to end,215,7
8551,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,in the world of witches it seems like young women can not catch a break abused by their fathers and envied by their mothers they seek shelter in the magical world of haven here they hone their powers and cross boundaries into other dimensions when a rare male wizard kidnaps several young witches haven must take action tiffany a rebellious young witch is drafted to search for her missing sisters beginning a cross-dimensional quest against the forces of evil but whose evil with the possible exception of tiffany everyone in this story commits reprehensible acts the villain is odious but his cruel quest for revenge is built up with a heart-rending backstory the plight of the young witches is sympathetic but it is impossible to endorse the social structure of the coven which thrives off it is own form of sexual abuse tiffany seems largely unaware of her miserable circumstances while she is beginning to question the mores of the world around her she never considers or experiences an alternative in a truly feminist book either romantic love or sisterhood would win the day here tiffany remains isolated her future unclear this is not to say that witches is a bad book this is not a negative review i believe the moral ambiguity in witches is intentional the story is well-written and plotted the magic is exciting and the moral mysteries will keep me occupied for some time there are many who are clearly wrong but who is in the right,249,8
8552,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,i liked the premise of this book the story was quite good i like the different aspects that were woven into the story line great descriptions the characters were good I had like to read more of tiffanys story there are a lot of lives to follow up on good read a great book to add to your tbr list,59,9
8553,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,this story keeps you guessing over and over you really have a hard time telling who is the good guy here it pretty much seems everybody is bad in their own way i think book 2 will explain more but i did enjoy reading this book there is a lot of violence and i would not recommend this for a younger reader for sure rape is mentioned many many times there is one strong stand out female hero that you will root for worth the read,86,10
8554,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,1.0,negative,book is ok but did not hold my interest was bored through most of it i try to finish the books i start,22,11
8555,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,5.0,positive,this was a very good series i enjoyed it very much i would recommend this book series to others did not want to put it down,25,12
8556,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,3.0,neutral,this was a good read however the between worlds was stretching the imagination a little far i would not go on with the series,23,13
8557,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,2.0,negative,reading this was like reading dictation on a story arc for what not to do in a writing class the story arc itself was good and the characters were interesting but the errors were annoying as were all the passive voice and the telling i did read this to the end and regretfully it did not get better my suggestion is that the author go back to this story and edit it a few more times maybe ten more times since his second book received better reviews i am guessing his skills are growing my advice to potential readers is to read all the reviews here and then the sample before buying luckily my version for kindle was free,119,14
8558,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,as i was reading this i had the feeling i should have read the prequels because a lot of the plot was like i knew all the backstory it was actually pretty good other than that I am looking forward to the reading the rest of the series,47,15
8559,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,this was a good book i give it 4 stars it is a little short i would be curious to see what happens in the next one so if you enjoy this kind of book then get it and enjoy reading,40,16
8560,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,5.0,positive,i liked this story it was enjoyable to read something original i am interested to see what happens to the heroine in the next book,25,17
8561,Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,this was a surprisingly good read i was not expecting much from a free book but i enjoyed it i really loved the authors style of writing and the story line was very original never read or heard anything along these lines before i just wish it was longer,47,18
8562,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this pathetically short story has a lot of problems not just incorrect word choice one does not bundle into someone for example but general lack of research and care taken by the author her description of water sports theand what he does to her are not particularly graphic there is no emotional connection nor did i feel the characters struggle of enjoying it and not enjoying it honestly i feel like the author needs to read more smut and then get an editor and then publish sloppy short and not particularly passionate,93,0
8563,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,does the word bidet call to mind flowery french ambiance where everyone trips all over themeselves to carefully observe the rules of etiquette and fine upbringing well forget that and brace yourself this is burning hot fiction that is literally dripping in passion from the get go the author takes us by the hand and guides us down little imagined corridors of domination and submission that involve all sorts of hardware and spraying attachments the imagery is dead on and you will squirm in your chair as gina opens herself ready and willing for all that maximum has in store for her short and almost unbearably hot,106,1
8564,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,i love aphrodite hunts writing style this is extremely naughty which would make most women blush but because it is so well written you get drawn into the story and the scenes are very dirty indeed this full-on style may not be for everyone but if you love authors like zoharah jay the erotic diary of a bored housewife the complete 6 volume series of compelling and erotic adult short stories who write intelligent but still very sexy short stories then this one is for you,91,2
8565,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,aphrodite hunt gets down to business immediately no beating around the bush a blond dude makes a co-ed sit on her haunches on a bidet rim holy double-p so much metal is used on her she can hardly walk if almost-painful master-slave play is your thing you would love it,49,3
8566,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,what a start for a book from the first word unable to put down but need to find some fine loving after this wow hot,25,4
8567,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,I am not sure what to think about this story yes it is short and it only gives you a glimpse of what the full story would be like it is kinda hot a little weird i did not like some of the descriptive words that were used they threw me off a bit all in all it is an ok read if you need something quick,62,5
8568,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,very abrupt no build up just got to the point very very very very very very very quickly what was i expecting in seventy some pages,26,6
8569,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,not to my taste which probably colors my opinion of the writing fair i imagine someone who likes that sort would rate it a bit higher but i can not imagine anyone rating it as great literature still i guess i got what i paid for it was free,48,7
8570,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,explicit sex story only about 40 pages read in an hour and continues with purchase of next book this was a freebie to get you hooked to buy the subsequent books sad that it could not just be put together to make a whole regular book,45,8
8571,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,the writer obviously has never seen a bidet i have had them in my bathrooms for 35 years simple cleansing and nothing like described in the book,27,9
8572,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,a decent erotica book but could have been much better with more character development,14,10
8573,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,interesting start to the series makes you wonder if all of the sex is worth the main female character getting in makes you want to buy the rest of the series to see but I am not convinced yet,38,11
8574,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,ok i know people get into the bdsm scene and all but this was just a foul mistreatment of a girl she was willing i know but still foul the ending was suggestive of even worse just boo,38,12
8575,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,good hot sexy read but too short hopefully the next level book will be longer in length and more sexy and hot,21,13
8576,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,this was a quick read and not a stand alone no real plot and lots of sex,17,14
8577,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,okay that headline was not a true sentence from the book but it is what it sounded like in my head weird clit-run material for women w at least better taste than the shades of grey fan-fapperettes out there,37,15
8578,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,not any exceptiomnal material and I am not asking much but have some purpose to the action here pretty much exectly what it says for mega-bimbo to take on various adonis undergrads and who can not speak but mostly gruny come on you b how about some gratitude how about some emotion besides endless peak orgasmic metaphysical experiences,59,16
8579,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,this book is steamy steamy steamy and creative the bidet concept is great for this who are interested in reading about the bdsm world this is a quick powerful read that you will really enjoy if you are into power play this book will surprise you with what the main character is required to do but it brings you into a fantasy realm that you may not have ever considered it is heavy on the humiliation but that is what books can be for enjoying reading about things you would likely never do in real life just keep in mind this book is not meant to be reality it has an alpha male a submissive female and an intense story it is fiction and if you can enjoy it for that you will like it,132,17
8580,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,very short story defiantly written so you have to buy all the small books to get the entire story,19,18
8581,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,oh gosh that was legitimately intense I am glad that the chapter of my sorority did not do anything like that d not that i would have minded but still,27,19

8583,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,very disappointing read luckily i was not out any cash for it,12,21
8584,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,not worth it at all reading the stories from playboy are somewhat better than this and it is nothing but a teaser just not a very good one so no i will not be buying the rest of this book,38,22
8585,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,sexy but short and missing something I am going to try to get more by this author and see if things are better in another story,25,23
8586,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,that is right young ladies strap on those feather panties because it is time to squash your self dignity and respect and at the same time become the most popular girls in college the unfortunate down side is you will be branded an easy skank but a lot of women can live with that label right millions of women do it every day buy to get into this high profile club you have to be on display during your initiation so yeah it will not be your little secret because every one going to that college has a front row seat to your debunking congratulations ladies because any one can join and any one can watch because in this school we are all a bunch of depraved over sexed lunatics it makes me wonder what they do when men try to join laughing out loud,140,24
8587,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,if your really into bdsm and humiliation hen this would be great for you unfortunately I am not that into but it was still pretty hot so it is a good free read,31,25

8589,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,seriously hot co-ed bdsm action or should that be bidet-sm explicit and full of action this story is a real turn-on and great to find a bit of bdsm with a few novel twists I shall definitely be coming back for more,43,27

8591,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,really ridiculous fantasy about sex and what men and women want it should be banned burned gotten rid of in some way it is drivel,24,29
8592,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,just awful just nasty i was sorry that i bought it and the whole series i deleted all of them,20,30
8593,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this improbable story line is strictly for the swooning heroine dominated by the cruel master crowd but may not satisfy even them the hoped-for emotional entanglement never developes so it just seems like bullying the writing is sloppy and the scenario is contrived i do not read much of this genre but even i have read better,56,31
8594,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,be warned this is a hard core erotic novella it is very short although i believe there are more installments but i barely could handle this one it was not enjoyable to read this type of story,36,32
8595,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,i am new to this sort of books and i thought it was well written and powerful i enjoy it and i could feel the passion and the pain when reading this it is terrible horrible and i can not look away i enjoyed this even although I am not sure why because it is not something i would normally enjoy i did the heroine is too willing to get into this club i bet it is not even worth all the humiliation the hero if you could even call him that is a complete and total alpha male i do not like him i do not like either character one submits too easily and one is too dominant,113,33
8596,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,I have read erotica before but not like that it is very tantalizing and my body was feeling what she felt how this was written very deliberate and detailed down to the placement of chains and clamps all i can say is can i be initiated sounds like fun,47,34

8600,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,i know bdsm i know humiliation play and i know very well all the devices that can incite pain and pleasure i made countless stupid mistakes in my youth so i get ginas desperate attempt to get into an elite club at college and i understand her willingness to do whatever it takes for entry into that club the manipulative man who takes advantage of girls in desperation he might be the only reasonable factor in the story a bdsm-virgin saying that 6 metal clamps on her sensitive area does not induce pain and only intense pleasure no the same girl also willing to be humiliated real humiliation have a strange man p on her while her private part is stretched wide open very far-fetched mindset hate to be the grammar nazi but one either removes clothes or takes off clothes one does not remove off clothes the writing is smooth in general that is the only redeeming factor,159,38
8601,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,this is a good start to a series i enjoyed the fact that the author dove right into the sex and did not waste any time with unnecessary background stories great twist on the nipple / pussy clamps also no pun intended definitely worth buying,42,39

8608,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,this is a trainwreck it is terrible horrible and i can not look away i enjoyed this even although I am not sure why because it is not something i would normally enjoy i did the heroine is too willing to get into this club i bet it is not even worth all the humiliation the hero if you could even call him that is a complete and total alpha male i do not like him i do not like either character one submits too easily and one is too dominant cover thoughts this cover is horrible but props for actually trying to fit the story it is complete obvious this is used by some really bad editing program,113,46
8609,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this was a complete waste of time i like lite dom / sub but the children shower was too much for my taste,21,47

8611,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,if you are not interested in submission / bdsm this is not for you i found this short story to be well written with the right mix of submission eroticism and bdsm a college freshman is looking to get into a highly exclusive club how far will she go you will have to read this quick but intense story will look for more from this author,64,49
8612,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,laughing out loud the things some people will do to get into an exclusive club bleh so not hot the writer seemed obsessed with bodily fluids a little okay but every other line or so bit much for me,37,50
8613,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,if you like a little domination and submission and to dabble in humiliation you will probably enjoy this short erotic initiation delight from aphrodite hunt i really enjoyed her attention to detail and interesting language the story was short but had substance and while it was not the best short i have ever read it was stimulating and exciting enough for me to ask what has next will i read the next piece in this series maybe if it was cheaper but i did enjoy it for what it was worth and damn what a creative way to use water,98,51
8614,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,it was ok for me it was not great but it was good to read if u like punishment and chains then you should read this book by aphrodite hunt I am looking forward to reading the next one,39,52

8623,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,to say this short rocked is doing it a disservice it was full of vivid descriptions slightly questionable consent and hot action i felt like i was front and center watching it unfold definitely a good buy,37,61
8624,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,this short was filled with a lot for it is length the characters play their parts well and for the type of writing it is erotic short it gets you to the point as it should i think a little more set up would have helped to make gina and maxs characters more of believable and a little less stock characters but I am not sure that was the authors point overall i think this short deserves 3 stars and would earn a 35 if the characters were a bit more developed,90,62
8625,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,i am new to this sort of books and i thought it was well written and powerful i enjoy it and i could feel the passion and the pain when reading this,32,63
8626,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,i downloaded this book when it was offered for free i was not sure what to expect but by the end of the book i was very satisfied i would not have been disappointed even if i had paid for it it kept me glued to my kindle and i lost some much needed sleep over it the author kept me guessing till the end i did not know for certain who the enemy was the only downfall was that some parts did not flow smoothly and i did need to reread for clarification this book read part fairytale and part gothic romance will read this author again,107,0
8627,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,at times it seemed reminiscent of jane eyre but like other reviewers have said the heroine was rather dim-witted i understand the need to occasionally see past the truth for the sake of mystery but when all the other characters are able to connect the dots so quickly it leaves the main character looking stupid as i got it while on the free list i did not lose anything but time and i feel that the main character aside there was promise and talent to the writing perhaps i will try another from the author before giving up on her but i would not recommend this particular novel,107,1
8628,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,this is a gothic romance with a huge dark castle towers cliffs villains secrets and a resident ghost catherine is a 20 year old girl who because of a family misunderstanding was reared as a servant by her aunt and uncle in the united states her father sends his ward to retrieve her when he realizes that he is dying the story is in 1st person told from catherines point of view the dark lord jonathan is her fathers ward who is sent to bring her home her feelings about him gave me whiplash more than once she seemed taken with him upon meeting him sharing all sorts of information about her life but then she becomes intractable and uncooperative even although she has willing to return to her fathers house simply to annoy him why she as a 20 year old who has been cooped up in her relatives attic believes that she knows more about traveling the world than a viscount who has traveled around the world simply put catherine is stupid she is told repeatedly to trust certain people and yet puts her trust in those who she has the fewest reasons to trust she never asks questions never has anything explained to her and completely ignores the obvious by the time she stops being oblivious and gets some gumption the novel is nearly over it is a gentle novel suitable for the young but it is slow and catherine is an annoying heroine,246,2
8629,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,i love books that may have more to follow you get attached to the family and want to know how others are doing,23,3
8630,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,1.0,negative,if you want to read a book in where the heroine acts like a 2yr old this is the book for you i gave up just before 1/2 way and i am deleting this book from my kindle so i do not accidentally choose it again to re-read i kept hoping the hero would chuck her over the side of the boat or toss her out of the carriage and say good riddance i would rather give it zero stars,83,4
8631,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how well i enjoyed this book it was interesting and suspenseful but somewhat short however i found it unrealistic for the two main characters to fall in love in the short amount of time they did i felt the woman was somewhat fanciful and silly for not putting the plot together somewhat sooner overall the book is worth reading and well written,66,5
8632,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,this reminded me of a victoria holt novel i really liked the story line romance ghosts and mystery and i liked the love-hate relationship between the hero and heroine the romance was tame but it was a pleasant read well worth the 99 cents i am glad that the author got a publisher and republished it,57,6
8633,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,while the story is well written and very gothic-esque i found the heroine to be too passive and very frustrating as far as I am concerned those who loved her put her through an awful amount of unecessary pain and suffering without some type of reaction from her at all there should have been some outrage on her part for being kept out of the loop not a bad read and better than most free kindle books but not great either,80,7
8634,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,loved these types of books lots of excitment in them they are back in time and it makes you love hearing about how things were in those years,28,8
8635,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,i think this story would have been much stronger told in third person and not first then we could have been given more insight to jonathan the mystery was also easy to solve i had the culprits pegged way before the end catherine was well off-base through much of the novel and sometimes i felt like shaking her still i found the tale interesting and a good clean read,69,9
8636,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,1.0,negative,i like dark romances once in a while that is why i downloaded this one but there had to be some redeeming qualities in the hero and this guy just did not have any even after he found our heroine was abused and lied to her whole life even after her life was in danger he was just plain mean and nasty to her and blamed her for everything and then she fell in love with him nope do not buy it our heroine was treated as cinderella by her aunt and uncle abused and unloved her whole life and yet the second she gets away from them she turns into a shrew acting like and treating people like her cousin treated her nope do not buy it very disappointed in this one and it had such great potential nobody grew emotionally nobody redeemed themselves nobody had a brain their head our heroine was supposed to be this intelligent person and yet she did some of the most idotic things throughout the book do not waste your time or money just not worth it,176,10
8637,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,1.0,negative,to start i love romance novels of all kinds i usually recognize amazing writing but i definitely do not find it a requirement in this genre however unless this book was written by a 13 year old I am shocked by the poor quality of the writing i cut my teeth on barbra cartland so know that i do not demand much additionally there is a big difference between naiveity and stupidity I am pretty sure the author does not understand this I am so annoyed with this book and so grateful that i did not spend money on it grrr,95,11
8638,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,the dark lord weaves a story about catherine who was raised by an aunt and uncle after her mothers death and treated in the vein of cinderella jonathan is an orphan raised by her father and isto believe that she is a spoiled brat who does not appreciate the love and gifts her father has sent her over the many years as her father is dying he asks jonathan to go retreive her jonathan goes and he finds her in deplorable conditions he is unable to immediately put aside the years of hate although he knows that all the information he would ever known about her is wrong the story weaves a good albeit easily figured tale from here i found that as the story is told on first person it lacks some of the depth and therefore some of the heat that was potentially there i did enjoy reading it but would give it 35 stars which i have rounded up to 4 instead of down to 3,169,12

8687,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,I am really struggling to read do not think i can finish these just drag on and on and on with out any real direction too many plot paths and i do not feel that there is any growth in the characters this book has no element of belief to bring you into the books and keep you reading this author is too young and it shows in her writing she spends so much time on informing you about characters and then you never hear about them again or maybe you do 2 books later as much as i tried i can not recommend to read these books maybe this author will be better later on in life but right now it feels that I am reading a book written for a high school english class i would grade it a c-,137,13
8688,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,if there was a 1 that is what i would have rated this book first the author sarah swan writes 2 books for this seeker saga but she decides out of the blue that she has to busy with other things so there will be no book 3 but she says she might start a new series buyer beware sarah swan the author is not worth paying for any of her books and i would not you get engrossed then finding out the series stops at book 2,86,14
8689,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the premise was good but the dialogue failed the heroine may have been smart enough to get into the prestigious academy but she did not come across as an intellectual at all none of the characters seemed to have substance or depth if no one was talking the book went much better very difficult to finish as i stopped caring about the characters and their problems the poor friend back home never did get a decent phone call and why could not they access facebook or twitter sorry i purchased the second book before i read the first maybe i can return it,101,15
8690,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,found this book to be frustratingly slow and long with each action repetitively described over and over in a different way,21,16
8691,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this book i had knowwhat i was getting into because i did not read the back or little abstract of it but it was awesome I am so stoked to read the next ones,34,17
8692,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i find it had a strong storyline i also enjoyed the interesting little twists along the way curious to see if robs a nice guy or secretly a jerk as i suspect,32,18
8693,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,for a young market this is quite interesting but maybe a little predictable there is a lack of tension throughout that prevents me from reading further in the series but it is well written and may satisfy younger readers who relate to girl group dynamics theof the crystals itself is quite novel but the purpose gets a little confused along the way the second book may explain or fill in the missing bits but i probably will not read it,81,19
8694,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,do not bother the author gave up after only two books so we will never find out what happens so fustrating,21,20
8695,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,I have never read a story quite like this and i was hooked from the first chapter it was interesting and well done can not wait to read more love theof the crystals,33,21
8696,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this novel was decent it had quite a few grammatical errors in it but fueled my need for fantasy adventures great for teens / young adults worth a cheap thrill in this genre,31,22
8697,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,not so enthralling that you spend every waking moment reading it but definitely the perfect lunchtime or break time get away read,22,23
8698,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was ok after reading such terrible reviews i was sure it was going to be much worse but i did actually finish it my perspective is that the beginning of the book was much better than the end i understood exactly what she was doing until the moment she introduced the crystals from there she lost me i understand the pull to paranormal fiction and i think sarah has talent but thewas just too convoluted she went from this extremely descriptive detailed story line to a mashup of ideas all piled together the villain chris is so superficial and comic bookish he is so underdeveloped and the crystals what do the crystals do how did the one friend know so much about them it was a riddle and to be honest it was too confusing and vague to even want to find out more,147,24
8699,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the first chapter was great but after a while it became much weirder than what i ever imagined a mystery with magic and a cult club,26,25
8700,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i have had this book for a long time and i just can not get into it it drags on with anticipation giving very little detail about what has to come,29,26
8701,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was ok it was unnecessarily long and did not fully explain the role of some of the characters very repetitive and could have used a lot more details within the story i forced myself to finish it and was disappointed at the way it ended probably will not continue reading this series,52,27
8702,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i am so sick of seeing this cover be more original i have read 2 ebooks with this same cover i even have a blog post about books with this cover,31,28

8704,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i bought this book because of the cover art but unfortunately found this book to be a very dreadful read with little to no action at all just a dull day to day living of the main character that has a hard time standing up for oneself and is easily bendable to others desires,54,30
8705,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i just got bored trying to find the plot as i thought it was slow starting yet also rather bizarre that parents would allow their child to be sent off to an island alone just could not get into it,39,31
8706,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,it was really good but it took some time to get into and did not get amazing un till very near the end but it was good and had a very good story line very happy,35,32

8709,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the main character started out strong and independent but finished out by going against her thoughts and beliefs all for popularity and boys,23,35

8712,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the book has many drawn out parts personally think it could have been written better but you should read it and judge for yourself,24,38
8713,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,is it a real possibility to use crystals for power some believe in magical elements and some just love there beauty but this is a great read a little slow getting into it but picks up in the middle,39,39
8714,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,there was only 1 big mistake she had ashley looking out for people and the she said ashley was sitting next to tracy and the g d word is not needed it is offensive in my opinion,37,40

8721,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i am trying to read the second book in this installment however i am finding it very difficult to get past the horrible grammar the story line is great but the misspelled and/or missing words and phrases in these books really detracts from the quality of the product i paid for i am not sure if i am going to read any further but i definitely know that i will no longer purchase books from this particular author,78,47

8729,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,where did these crystals come from and do they hold so much power tracy needs to figure this out before she gets sucked into the nothingness an intriguing read for all you teenage girls out there the end will leave you wanting more,43,55

8738,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,it was good but took a while to get to the main story there was too much intro at the beginning,21,64
8739,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,well i started reading this a few days ago as i thought the blurb made it fascinating however i found myself loathe to read it the first book is really slow and there is really no point to it/ what took a whole novel could have been created in a few chapters very disapointed,53,65
8740,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,would have preferred to guess who the players were till the end hope next book leaves more to the imagination reminds me of the secret circle,26,66
8741,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,def not worth buying glad i rented it i do not think i will bother with the rest of the series,20,67
8742,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i enjoyed it I am not sure where the next one will go think it could have been longer and more detailed on characters relationships could have been drawn out but i like a lot of detail great story just more would have been nicer excited to read second I am sure it will be wonderful all around good read thank you,60,68

8744,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,liked the school on the island with so many caves and a haunted past which adds to great intrigue and adventure,21,70
8745,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,love books love this genre hate this book could not get into it was anticlimactic and lacked a dynamic element to make it worth multiple books absolutely would not recommend this to your average reader you will be lucky if you finish it i only did after months of seeing it staring at me on my kindle and hoping the ending did not suck that too was a huge disappointment,66,71
8746,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,it was not a good book i could not get in the book it really bore me to death i would not recommend this book to another friend,27,72

8748,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,I have read many books it starts off somewhat slow then hooks you will be looking forward to the 2nd book,20,74
8749,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the book has a good story line however it is very slow reading the action does not take place until the very end i like reading series so i will probably read the second book just to see what happens,39,75
8750,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this was one if the best books i have ever read it was exciting and had me guessing up until the last page i can not wait to start on the next one,32,76
8751,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,the book was good except for it could have been shorter because there was a lot of unneeded description by other than that it was a good book definitely worth 99,31,77
8752,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,a good read to pass the time but nothing superb or outstanding keeps you waiting for more but more never comes on to the second book maybe it will she had some light,28,78
8753,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,concept is weird hoping the second one is more exciting this one was slow and all over the place it was just ok,23,79
8754,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i just picked this book randomly and it turned out to be really good I am looking towards reading the other books in the series,24,80
8755,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,when reading it feels more like a rough draft of a good bookit tends to be ongoing at times where it most definitely was not neededit had the potential to be an excellent book but it just is not therefor a free book it is what you expectit definite lynn leaves you wanting to read the sequel although I shall give it that,60,81
8756,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i liked this book looking forward to reading the rest of them i can not wait to get the next book,20,82
8757,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this was a great try for a first book but is definitely geared for middle school or younger as it is very obvious it is a first try a lot of pointless garble the mainfor the scy-fi is a little rough however not to dissuade the younger reader as it is enough for you to want to keep reading to see the end result and i know the writer will continue to improve,72,83
8758,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the first thing i want to say is this book does have promise i love thebehind it but unfortunately felt like it fell flat for me typically i finish a book in a day and i found myself struggling to to get back into this one over a period of several as others have mentioned it was pretty slow in the beginning not much happened in my opinion until the middle and even then i felt like the action was pretty lackluster i felt as if the characters were very underdeveloped as well at the end of the book i still felt like i did not know any of the them and some characters ex the doctor in the beginning are made out to seem as if they will play an important roll later on but are never heard from or seen again not to mention the fact that the so-called forbidden romance that i was so anxious to get into hardly played a role in the story aside from a few minuscule scenes only on of which contained anything even remotely romantic it was basically non-existent and the reason why it was forbidden was completely absurd to me possibly because it was never truly explained i was disappointed as a whole for me there was too much unimportant filler material and not enough of what was promised in the book description the only thing that kept me from giving this book one star is the fact that i really do like the concept behind the authors take on the supernatural otherwise it was a complete miss for me so much so in fact that i chose to return it part of me wants to read on in the series to see if it ever improves but at this point i highly doubt i will,305,84
8759,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i could not get into the story at all it is rare that i do not finish a book i can count maybe three times ever that i have not finished a book i started this was one of those times do not waste your money or time the book does not live up to it is creative and well thought out cover,56,85
8760,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,loved this book can not wait to finish the rest of the series it started off a little slow for me and i was not sure if i would enjoy it but by the middle of the book it had my full attention great read,43,86
8761,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,there were 5 things that made it hard to like this book 1 the author does not know the correct definition of the word penultimate yet insists on repeatedly using it 2 the line about butter being scraped thin over toast yeah tolkien worded it so much better 3 the main characters description of the old sailor at the beginning is quite racist she does not trust him because of his crude easten european possible russian accent if this book had been written in the cold war it would be one thing but it was not it makes the main character unlikeable right from the get-go and i therefore could not sympathise with her during the entire book 4 none of the other characters were particularly likeable either 5 the action of the book does not really begin until about halfway through as I had bought a bunch of books at once for my kindle i was not sure what sort of book this was supposed to be and by the time the plot actually unfolded it was hard for me to care i thought the concept for this book was interesting and the prose itself flowed decently but there were not enough things to like about this book to overcome the things i did not i will not be continuing to read this series or probably anything else by this author,225,87
8762,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,chosen seemed to go on and on and on without ever getting to the point i wish the author would have put some more hints or clues as to what the point of the book was i got 50 into it and finally just stopped reading it was well written in that the author was able to keep me reading for 50 without anything really happening seriously nothing happened,69,88
8763,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i really wanted to like this book but the plot was slow the characters underdeveloped and the writing itself was juvenile the author seems to just throw certain words around without them making sense or sometimes without the words fitting the tome of the book an example of it not making sense sounds exciting i said drily in my experience anything put together by anybody with a connection to administration ended up being completely moronic and lame you sound less than impressed the doctor quickly added with an equal amount of sarcasm he is not being sarcastic he is recognizing that she is not excited to go to the event however that could be me just being picky an example of not fitting the tone to my surprise the doctor laughed i was taken aback at first but then realized he was laughing gregariously rather than derisively it is as if the author was just trying to show off that she knew big words or perhaps she used a thesaurus i do not know and yes she did use that many unnecessary commas in one sentence and misspell the word dryly usually i can still read a book with things like this in it but it happens all the time i am a teen this book is aimed towards my age group and i disliked it strongly maybe they assumed that as teens we should not care about things like poor character development but we do,242,89
8764,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i wanted to like the book the story started out ok but it just dragged along several chapters in and nothing is happening and i find that i am not remotely invested in the main character i lost interest and tried to make myself read further but just could not do it,52,90
8765,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i just never cared about the characters the plot was slow with very little build up chris was predictably the bad guy but still played along like the reader could not guess worst book i have read in a while,40,91
8766,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,ok so personally this book was just ok to me it was too slow paced for the first half and there was too much repetition in tracys internal dialogue for me also i felt like there were a lot of events that were left unexplained and the characters lacked growth and depth as the story progressed but if you make it through this book the second book is great i really enjoyed the forward by the author that explains how she took her readers suggestions about the first book to heart honestly i think that she did a fantastic job catering to what her readers wanted the second book is believable fast paced and the characters actually grow and there has a lot of action in conclusion i give this book about 2 stars and the second book 5 stars so when you average that out it is a 35 stars for the series so far,154,92
8767,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was a fresh new concept there has vampires and werewolves and elves running around most of the young adult literature this one dealt with crystals the story was slow for the first 1/2 but the second half picked up the pace interesting characters and storyline not going to read the sequal as it is not pulling me in to want more i found myself scanning through a lot of the pages because i was not interested in the detail of her walking through the woods and more but if you have time and you want a break from the typical paranormal it is not bad but it is not great,107,93
8768,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,chosen takes a while to get going but after all the backdrop to the tale is in place the story really picks up I have never read something with quite as interesting a premise although i wish the author made an effort to make her writing tighter in places there has a lot of potential to the series and i already got the next book forbidden to see if it develops like i hope,72,94
8769,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i first got this book as the cover attracted me and i was very pleasantly surprised after finishing it every chapter has something new exciting and fresh it did not make me cringe at all like a lot of teen paranormal fantasy books out there actually made me very engrossed in the mind of the main character which is surprising becaues she has very special abilities like the others in the book which is a great supernatural gift i highly recommend reading this and although the start was slow it really picked up and the second book is a lot better too with so much action a great series to just get away from it all,116,95
8770,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i thought this book was great it was very well written and i felt liek i was absorbed by the story it was hard to put down and i was so drawn to all of the characters this was a great read for young adults eve was my favorite characters and I had recommend this book to anyone who likes ya,60,96
8771,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i gave this book an honest shot i read the whole thing and tried to enjoy it sadly i could not the description of all the characters was like a sexy romance novel no one had a consistant personality the crystal stuff just about put me to sleep and the only character i kind of liked was for some reason revieled to be the bad guy near the beginning of the book rather than in the end where it might have made some kind of impact i will not be reading the next book also the cover image it is so pretty and honestly part of the reason i wanted to read the book but that scene never happens there is even a point when the main character says she did not bring any of her nice clothes with her to the island let along a gown,144,97
8772,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,this book is marketed for teens but teens and older are bound to be disappointed writing style is very simplistic and the plot is dragged out it is a page turner but only because you will be skipping pages,37,98
8773,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,it took a while for it to get interesting seems predictable hopefully book two moves in a faster pace and fleshes out the charecters more,25,99
8774,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i read chosen few weeks ago on my siss kindel since then I have got my own kindle and decided to buy the book because second book has just been released its called forbidden forbidden the seeker saga and it is kinda hard to find in the store and i like to have all sequel together in on place chosen is fine book for young girls and it has just right amount of romance and only one kissing scene i am looking forward to reading forbidden as soon as i post this review laughing out loud,96,100
8775,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,otherwise i would have been mad about the money spent overall this book is just pretty lame there are many scenes especially but not only in the beginning that are explained in way too much detail and which could be cut short by several pages even if the pace picks up towards the end it does still not get riveting one major problem being that the story is largely really predictable it just takes the heroine ages to put two and two together always furtheremore the author resolves in too many cases to totally steoretypical and lame story elements oooooooh the island used to be an asylum way back then where prisoners were mistreated uhuh there is thick fog when the heroine already forgot here name tries to get onto the island and so on in the end the bad guy is hunchbacked for the rest of his life and swears revenge right bad guy with a hunch that is a new one not in general the bad guys ambition is not really clear nor explored except that they want power and money pretty shallow book without much surprises,192,101
8776,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,loved this book loved the story loved the writing chosen goes in my top-3 favorite indie books of the last year i can not wait to read the sequal it is already downloaded on my kindle,34,102
8777,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,i was expecting more but the ending does leave you wanting to know more i felt that by the time anything happen i was at 80 reading through the book and it was just too much of the tracy thinking this book is definitely for younger girls embarrassingly enough i am over twenty and the was not for me if you feel that you may like it i suggest to read it but it was not that great i finished it and will not be reading the rest of the series,91,103
8778,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,chosen the seeker saga 1 is a good story i recomed it for teen ager is easy to read it,20,104
8779,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i do not understand how this book got such high ratings the characters seem very one dimensional even the heroine who traveled over 3000 miles to finish her high school at a boarding school across the country is not strong enough to tell pushy high school girls to stop telling her who her friends should be she lies left and right to keep both sides from being unhappy with her i prefer a stronger female for asorry,78,105
8780,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,does anyone else actually believe that a parent would send their only child to a boarding school that they are not even permitted to check out first i mean come on for all they know they just sent their 16 year old daughter off with a child sex traffic-er,48,106
8781,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i have read yearbooks with a better plot this was like a bad tiger beat magazine mixed with a after school special from the 90s i was really looking forward to the concept of magic use in relation to crystals but found it hard just to follow the story line with out wishing the main character would get some counseling at some point and stop talking about which boy was cuter or who she had to be friends with in her new school by far not something i would read again or suggest to any one i know,98,107
8782,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,many people have already mentioned many of the flaws in this book i finished it but it was not because i felt compelled by the amazing plot it was more because i had to know if any of the pieces came together they do not spoiler the plot elements never come together the story line is trite and the characters are really boring there is all of thisup and it goes nowhere the reviewers that said this was well-written were being too kind it reads like a middle schoolers first story notebook i was not impressed i read a lot of yla and i was hoping for potential this is not worth your time,117,108
8783,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i bought this book based on the reviews i had read on amazon I am sorry to say it was massively disappointing it is an immature imagining of fantasy for teens many parts read like a middle aged woman trying to sound like a teen the plot was stilted and poorly paced and the ending was abrupt and poorly done I am just glad that i only paid 99 cents for it,69,109
8784,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,the story was slow the author spent too much time describing things on the island and not enough time on the plot nothing actually happens until almost half way through the book and the writing was somewhat juvenile i do not have any desire to read the rest of the series,50,110
8785,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this book is a good book but does not really end on anything the ending felt like it was hurried in order to not give too much information away so that she could write a second book also the love in the story was lacking she does have a little romance with someone but it is only for about 4 pages and then over this book is more of an action novel than a romance novel however i would recommend this book for friends but would not pay more than 99 for the book i will most likely read the second book of the series,104,111
8786,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book is so-so i thought that tracy was an intriguing protagonist and the world building was done fairly well i got a great sense of what a crystal seeker was and yet the author still manages to leave some mysteries surrounding these crystals in order to pique my interest because of this i just might read the next book another strong point of the novel is the authors writing the descriptions are wonderfully vivid and i can just close my eyes and perfectly imagine the island and boarding school now why just two stars then well for starters the bad guys of the novel are almost laughably stereotypical and as well-rounded as the female characters are developed the male ones are the opposite completely one-dimensional i also hope that the author will not be focusing too much on love in the future installments because in this novel it appears to be as although she has building up to a triangle or quadrangle whatever but love and lust falls flat here probably because the males are not developed enough and because I am tired of the whole love at first sight trope especially when it is obvious to the reader that the male romantic interest is no good at all for our heroine it just makes reading their scenes together painful if we are going to get invested in that storyline at least make the guy somewhat interesting another critique it is just very hard to suspend disbelief at the whole boarding school situation it is on a little island parents can not visit at all and yet they allow thei kids to attend overall it is an okay read that is only somewhat entertaining but it would have been much better if the villains were also better and the guys not so dull and simple,295,112
8787,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was a good book but not great i read it and finished it and i am interested to know what happens next but not dying to know this was not a book that i could not put down actually it was sorta boring intill about half way through i ended up really enjoying the book and i will read the next book when it comes out if i remember,69,113
8788,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i bought this book because of all the positive reviews and the tiny price tag i wish i had saved myself a buck and bought a bag of chips instead i hated all the characters and the writing was clunky and slow at best save yourself a headache and stay away,51,114
8789,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i am a fan of ya lit but this book was so silly it was slow boring and far fetched save your 99 and buy a book worth your time,30,115
8790,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,the writing in this book is not bad at first it starts off really drawing you in this book had major potential what i did not like was how the main characters do not really seem to grow as much as they seem to have multiple personalities some of them start off as terrible mean girls who suddenly are kind of cool and i will not spoil the surprise for anyone who still wants to waste their time but let us just say for me it was dissapointing and not developed the only action and it is not even exciting enough to be called action was in the last couple chapters the writer did a good job of making me curious and that is about all i was so let down with what was all revealed boring,130,116
8791,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this book was slow to start but turned out to be great i can not wait to read the next book in the series,24,117
8792,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this was a good book i really enjoyed the story line as well as all of the characters there were many surprised in the book that i loved i love the romance in this book even although you do not get much of it this book is worth the read,49,118
8793,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this book really took me by surprise as i search amazon this was in my recommendations bar i went ahead and took a chance to read something else other than what i must read and you know what i like it i had only meant to read just a chapter or two and before i knew it it was 1 am what hooked me to this book is the great plot line i am sucker for boarding school stories but also the fact that they are on an island i really enjoyed how with every new chapter more about the school and it is purposes are exposed the characters of the book were good each were clear with their motive from the start which was sort of strange and refreshing to read usually you have to read more to pull more of the characters out they did have secrets but it was not gasping i also adored the magic twist to it i read so many stories about powers and how the characters get them so when i read this twist i was intrigued and it kept me entertain till the end of the book overall this is a good book chosen is wise and witty with refreshing characters it is not like most book out there really different if your looking for a new twist in magic or powers read this book,229,119
8794,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,did not love this book but it was a good buy at 99 i would probably read it again and if you like young adult fantasy you will probably enjoy reading this,30,120
8795,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was pretty good i would not say it was the best ever it had an interesting premise and there was plenty of good imagery around the setting of the island the problem for me was the characters they fell completely flat i did not feel like any of them where good people and all of them were far to annoying and whiny they constantly felt like mary sue characters to me each of them acted just exactly as cliche dictates they should i will definitely keep an eye out for the next book to see if the character building improves because like i said this story has a very interesting premise,111,121
8796,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i liked this book alot i was not sure i was going to like it but I am glade i bought this book i liked all the characters and i thought it was different then any book I have read in a why 'll the book might start out a bit slow but do not let that stop you from reading it it speeds up sooo i would definitely recommend you read this book,70,122
8797,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,i probably would not have thought twice about reading this book but i was drawn in by the price after i went through a few other books from that 399 or less buying spree i dove into this one well i mean conceptually it is somewhat interesting but i could not stop thinking that this was a supernaturally tinted version of mean girls or something along those lines it does not have the greatest flow and can be choppy at times my biggest annoyance was the jarring switch from first person to third person when talking from another characters perspective the story is predictable and the characters do not always have the best depth but it is an entertaining read none the less,118,123
8798,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was sort of slow paced and tediuos i would not read the sequel unless i was really bored if your looking for an entertaining read this is not t it,31,124
8799,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was way to slow for my taste thewas interesting enough but it left me feeling empty at the end also the authors description of the main characters thought process was way too drawn out it really was like being in the head of a teenage girl and honestly who wants to experience that again if your a girl,61,125
8800,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,after reading a few reviews i was really interested in this series and thought i would love it sadly i was more disappointed and at this time do not feel a great need to continue with the rest of the series i think the author tries too hard to build tension in spots where there really is not enough suspense or action to move the story along i always try to finish a book through giving it the benefit of doubt that it will get better but again i do not think chosen is strong enough or compelling enough at this time the story is based on tracey a high school junior relocating to an exclusive school on a remote island the island was a former prison and is supposed to hold hidden mysteries tracey is quickly sucked into a clique of friends who are secretly crystal seekers tracey learns she possesses the power to be a crystal seeker as well but tries to avoid and/or decline this magical gift during the story it never gives a clear grasp on what the magical capabilities are traceys new friends as well as the villain in the story are trying to use tracey in order to achieve greater power and rule the world there has an attempt at a bit of a love connection with tracey and robb but i felt that was lacking as well also the author tries to make the villain s more sinister and evil but i just felt that this missed the mark as well,253,126
8801,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i read this on my sisterss kindle and it was a fun read if i could go back and buy it i would to give the author some sales the cover is also enchanting i want the next one now ps i did go back and buy it on my kindle i loved the location the characters i thought it was so unique and took me out of my regular life i can not wait for more from this great author,80,127
8802,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the young adult paranormal fantasy genre is full to the brim with high-quality writing well-planned story lines and engaging characters unfortunately this is not one of those books if you are looking for an average read to pass the time it will suffice but there are better stories available this is not one i would recommend even with the 99 price tag,58,128
8803,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this was a pretty interesting story the action seemed a bit jumpy and I am not sure i bought some of the characters motivations that said I am still interested in seeing where the author is going with this story,38,129
8804,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,this book was horrible after reading the twilight series the vampire diaries and all of the sookie stackhouse books I am always looking for a clever read this is not it not much character or plot development i feel dumber having read it,41,130
8805,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i bought this book because the cover is so pretty the writer does not always tell her story like a pro but i fell in love with the characters and over all the book was so much fun a great escape from regular life i will be looking for the next book,51,131
8806,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,let me start by saying that i really enjoyed this book but it took me awhile to get into it please do not give up reading it really does not start with the action until after the 50 on kindle but do not let that stop you because the action that does come is amazing I am really into ya and paranormal romance novels but i get bored really quick with the same vampire fairy angel werewolve story this is not one of those stories at all the basis behind this story is a completely differenti want to call it a newbecausenever seen it but i did kinda remind me of the secret circle in a tiny way i can not wait for the rest of this series pick it up and give it a try you will not be sorry,142,132
8807,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,try as i might i could not like this heroine i did not respect her or like her weak personality there are many logical errors in the plot that really pulled me out i did not like how predictable and stereotypical it was either there were no surprises and no depth how sad that the good looking people are the good guys and the ugly the bad the girl was desperate to fit in with the popular people which is lame i would rank the book lower but i did finish it,90,133
8808,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i bought this for my kindle because it sounded like a good story and the cover looked interesting but the story was boooorrring and took too long for anything to develop none of the characters were very sympathetic or likable including tracy the heroine of the book all she ever did was whine and complain and the secondary characters were selfish and bitchy also i do not understand the cover because tracy never wore a ballgown in the book she only wore jeans and what is with the butterflies i do not get it maybe if i was a teenage girl i might like it but i am a grown woman and i could not get into this book,117,134
8809,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was a little on the slow side for me i found myself skimming and skipping pages which is something i never try to do it took way to long for the action to pick up and i did not understand the romance at all what happened with the sexy young doctor what was the whole purpose of the hospital scene hopefully book two will be better i really hate to quit a series,74,135
8810,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i gave this book a try but i got 3/4 of the way through and just could not finish the story is incredibly slloooow and i kept falling asleep i did not care about a single character and the romance yawn the island setting was cool but i was frustrated with constant references to the sinister history without coming to the point i do not think the basic premise of the plot is bad but it needs to move a little faster,77,136
8811,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i agree with the other reviews it was extremely slow for the first 7 chapters it did pick up a little however not enough this book dragged all the way through the characters never developed the story line is terrible the so-called romance well it is does nt exist i am terribly disappointed can i have back the time i spent reading this book so boring,64,137
8812,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book came up as a recommendation for me and after reading all the five star reviews and seeing the low price i thought why not i thought the story started strangely there was a whole page about the significance of the date september 23rd of all things i thought tracys back story of wanting to go to a good school was interesting and different but as soon as we got to part where she has to travel to the school alone things got sketchy the whole situation was too weird and ridiculous to believe it might be because being on a creepy island in the middle of nowhere where people rarely leave sometimes it sounded like they could not leave does not appeal to me at all but tracy seemed to eat it up despite several ominous warnings everything was just so weird i could not believe the things that tracy went along with i did not like any of the girls in the group not sure why i was supposed to and the love interest did not seem to have any redeeming qualities beyond having pretty eyes I am not sure what happened around chapter seven to make the story seem better but i never made it there it should not take that long for a story to get interesting if you do not hook me in the first three chapters we are done i guess if you do not mind a very slow story build up and weird situations then this is the story for you but if not do not waste your money there are thousands of other ya romances to read that are done better,269,138
8813,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,first off this books cover has nothing to do with the book itself this girl does not even like to dress up i understand thecorrelation but that is it on to the book the writing is a bit choppy but it is easy to ignore thankfully the editing is good what i could not ignore was the heroines ridiculousness it is like she had no will of her own and was so into herself that she did not even notice her friends were not her friends i am disappointed that she is not a stronger character also the dialogue is a bit redundant okay very redundant there are paragraphs where something is being explained then the next character explains it again theis different and for that alone gives the review a few stars i highly enjoy the ability these characters have and there has great potential here but it is not clear exactly what can be done with them taking over the world and her eyes filled with greed are not helpful if you have nohow they can be accomplished the bad guy was also a bit ridiculous I am not sure if it was supposed to be a whodunnit but there is no way to hide who he was in this writing sadly i will not be reading any sequels of this book the promise is there and i am sure the writer will do better the next book but i am already turned off to the writing and characters especially the main one,251,139
8814,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i was really excited to dig into this book from all of the really great reviews it seemed like everyone agreed that the book really picked up after chapter 7 but once i reached it i only continued to be disappointed i had a really hard time getting into the characters in this book the romance aspect completely fell flat spoiler i honestly left the book asking myself does rob even serve a purpose the author hyped up this intense connection between rob and tracy but nothing happens it was blatantly obvious well atleast to me who the villain was in this book not to mention you do not get to know the girls that spoiler are part of the crystal seekers at all they are all just rude and i feel the dialogue runs around in circles there was no character development within this book and tracy herself was bland and whiny i think the overallplot could be really great it is very original and with the right direction could really be something compared to all the other ya books i would just like to see some more character exploring within the next book and less monotonous writing on how tracy felt about trying to get out of the situation she was in all and all i wish tracy embraced her situation more in this book and that we were able to get to know the characters instead of just seeing the glimpse as to what they could be still debating if i would read the second to try and give it another chance,264,140
8815,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,there is almost no pace in the story for the first half tracy has a strong character and the story is different from the usual ya paranormal point of view the only good things in this book it ends without resolving anything love life tracys powers origin of the crystals,51,141
8816,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i just finished reading crystal seekers and I am still thinking about the book i will admit that the first 7 chapters were pretty slow and boring for me it was not until midway into chapter 7 really sparked my interest then i could not put my kindle down i had to finish reading the story i loved how sophia sharp really developed each character i have read her dream realms trilogy and i will say I am hooked on her writing i highly recommend this book I am looking forward till her 2nd part of crystal seekers comes out hopefully soon there is a little romance in this book which i love makes me wonder what has gon na happen in the next books if you have not read her dream realms i recommend those books to read,131,142
8817,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i was in the middle of an awesome book when sophia sharp the author of this amazing book was looking for proofreaders to get a sneak peek of this hidden treasure i had read sophias books before so i was not surprised when this turned out to be one of the best books i ever read but it was still amazing it took a few days for me to read it but i finished it and wanted to read it all over again reading about tracy and her life on traven island was so intriguing i could not put the book down sophia unravels the secrets hidden on this island and within tracy very carefully if you look closely several chapters convey secrets thatto a shocker ending that made me go how did i not see that coming tracy finds that life is not always normal and that speaks volumes for all of us life is unpredictable and tracy does not handle it the best way but her intention comes out in the end this is a book a would totally recommend to any reader who loves paranormal if you read like me you live in paranormal books twilight dream realms and more and this book does not overdue it it is the paranormal that makes you go what but also go wow i absolutely loved this book and there really is not much more to say except read the book,235,143

8839,Kindle_Store,B006NGHO6S,4.0,positive,this was my first grabarchuk puzzlebook but I am sure it will not be my last most of the puzzles seem to be spacial logical or counting but they are the most unique set of puzzles I have come across in a years time with my kindle i downloaded this while it was available as a free christmas download along with puzzlebook 100 puzzle quizzesand interactive given the price of this book and the other puzzlebooks I had recommend spending the additional few dollars to get 10 times as many puzzles once you start playing you are going to want to do more of them i have a k3 so thedoes not come through on my device however the puzzles are easy to decipher without requiring theso there has no loss of functionality because of that the puzzles and answers are easy to navigate just use your page forward / back and 5-way controller but make sure to read the directions before you start or you will jump to the answers instead of the next puzzle i did find the solution pages to be a little sparse for some of the puzzles especially for the one puzzle i guessed at once i knew the answer i went back to the puzzle and was able to figure out why it was the answer but some additional explanation would have been nice finally an observation i had after having played many of the amazon digital services games there are no hints timer or score with this game again not a criticism it is an electronic puzzlebook after all but just be aware of that if you like to play logical games for time,281,21
8840,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,1.0,negative,i am a certified personal trainer and part of what makes me knowledgeable is that i constantly seek self improvement i do this by researching books and articles with that said i read tip number 8 it hits the nail on the head in regards to the importance of breakfast however the composition of the food is not going to help you lose weight in fact it will do the opposite and because you to gain weight the foods suggested are on the medium to high side of the glycemic index these foods will quickly turn into sugar in your blood causing a spike in insulin which then promotes fat storage these foods will cripple your metabolism instead of utilizing fat to create energy your body will use the sugar you just fed on and store the excess sugar as fat to be utilized later or not depending on what other tips you decide to use from this book protein is the most thermogenic nutrient a person can consume your body burns almost twice as many calories breaking down protein than it does fats or carbohydrates therefore in order to speed up your metabolism you should think about consuming protein for breakfast combined with slow carbohydrates the ones that are on the far low side of the glycemic index those are the ones that will release energy slowly the only suitable time to eat foods on the high side of the glycemic index is immediately after a workout your body needs the fast carbohydrates to recover and repair if you liked my review and you are interested in my advice please visit my new page at [ ],276,0

8844,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,4.0,positive,i had just began a diet two weeks earlier and was obviously woefully ignorant of what all was actually involved when i made this commitment for fifty years i have been blessed with excellent health and had the metabolism to burn off whatever i ate no matter what it was and what quantity i ingested i was always naturally slim and muscular my dad grew up on a farm and at when i was only seven he made sure my family was going to get a taste of the farm life too taking care of the animals and gardening contributed to my body build on this farm i learned to hustle while working there was much work to be done and other stuff i wanted to be doing so the only way to get to do what i wanted to do was to hustle through the chores little did i know that this would forever shape the way i went about doing work for the rest of my life the payoff was never worrying about weight gain or what i ate donuts big gulps bowls ofcream barbeque no worries until i surpassed the age of fifty ron are you on high blood pressure medicine your cholesterol is high and you have elevated sugar levels 10 points from diabetic anyway the age of abuse was over my body could not handle anymore i had np problems cholesterol issues and high sugar levels i was also about 20 - 30 pounds overweight not obese but bordering on the big 0 so i started eating better taking vitamins and getting off all of the sugar it was not until i read a magazine article about the excess quantity of sugar americans eat that i reached an epiphany that i eat too much,291,4
8845,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,3.0,neutral,the book is full of exercise and dieting basics there were some grammatical and punctuation errors and some of the content is a bit dated but it is not too bad overall it is aquatic jock helpful read if you are just getting started also note that it is written from a uk context,50,5
8846,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,1.0,negative,i could have found this same information on google if you want a book to save you time googling this is it,22,6

8849,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,4.0,positive,as the author of weight loss choosing a diet that is right for you i compare books about diets food training with my book this book i really liked it is not a diet book nor a training book it is exactly what the title promises 52 ideas about loosing weight brilliant hmm maybe not but the book has a good layout nice fomatting is an easy read and actually hands you some good advice some of the things may be a bit odd but that also means new the ideas are mixed up with tips and interesting quotes i for one really liked it get a copy,108,9
8850,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,2.0,negative,there was nothing new to be gleaned from this book the author has just re-stated what you hear in every other book on every other show or from every other health expert i did not particularly glean anything from it glad it was free it was not very helpful,49,10
8851,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,1.0,negative,this was written by an english author and it was very boring it did have the basic weight loss information that is common knowledge,24,11
8852,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,2.0,negative,i got this free so i can not complain but this is not a very insightful book and the ideas are presented in seemingly random order i am sure there are other diet tip books out there with advice you can not find in magazines this is not one of them,48,12
8853,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,4.0,positive,when i read this i thought it would have some diet ideas or something like that but it did grab my interest when i was reading because it talked about how much you truly should eat so your weight stays the same how much you should exercise and more over all it was rather informational and it did give good tips and that is why i gave it a 4,69,13
8854,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,5.0,positive,the book emphasizes the importance of lifestyle change in order to be successful in achieving the great goal of many people lose some weight i totally agree with each little trick the author offers so you may change your balance,40,14

8857,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,4.0,positive,I have been reading a lot of books from this publisher some of the criticism of this one seems unfair i can not scientifically argue with the personal trainer but this book just gives solid basic good advice part of the beauty is for me that you do not need a degree in biology to understand so well done,56,17
8858,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,4.0,positive,great book but it does look like it is for a uk market as some of the information is from the metric system,23,18
8859,Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,3.0,neutral,this little book had some nice ideas about weight loss all the ideas were short and to the point so easy to read i also just purchasedthe ultimate fat loss secret and found it had some excellent tips as well thanks for the refreshing advice,47,19
8860,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this does not tell you how to pronounce the words it only shows you the picture the work in english and the work in french did not like this at all,29,0
8861,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i took french in high school too many years ago and now work in a bilingual area this book is honestly no help unless you want to learn about your animal words save your money unless you get it free,40,1

8863,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i was not impressed with this app to help learn french it was extremely basic and did not fit my needs which were to review french for my trip to france,31,3
8864,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,an okay selection of phrases but this needed to be an application not a book i did not manage to make the audio work and it was not worth the trouble to figure it out,33,4
8865,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,it is good for your children but if you want to learn or improve your french please find another books the vocabulary is too easy although i found some sentences are quite useful but still too easy vocab,36,5
8866,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,the audio which accompanies book must be purchased separately so if you are trying to learn how to speak and understand french and have never taken it before this book will not help much if you want this as a vocabulary refresher / reminder or if you only want to learn to read elementary french childrens books or maybe street signs not madame bovary or cousine bette then this book is excellent with audio it would have gotten 5,75,6
8867,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,last i saw there were no reviews on this and since i look at reviews constantly to pick things to buy i figured i could share what i know about this book it is a very simple vocabulary book so there has a word with a picture like bird and a picture of a bird and then it gives you the french word under that it gives you several sample sentences like i have a bird and then their translations no that is not an exact example i am paraphrasing if you do not know french at all not having any sort of pronunciation guide could be an issue i rather wish there was one myself i have not taken french for a long time but still seems to be a well done book for refrencing french vocabulary even if you will not really be able to pick it up and teach yourself a new language,156,7
8868,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,i downloaded this book to brush up with my french it is a two part download you download the book here and you have to go to the publishers website to download the audio i never had the chance to download the audio because they do not have the ipad as a platform they have kindle although i emailed the publisher but i never received a response about my dilemma anyway I am giving the book three stars because I am only rating one half of it update after four days since sending the publisher email they gave me instructions on how to download the audio but it was for the kindle only nothing for the ipad,114,8

8888,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i probably made a mistake i know a lot of french but as people who have studied languages in schools and universities we read a lot do a lot of grammar but do not learn enough everyday vocabulary and expressions and never or almost never develop fluency the book would be helpful to someone who is just beginning to learn french,61,28
8889,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,good to help you learn french but should get audio so you can pronounce the words and start to hear the language,22,29

8905,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this would be useful for very very basic beginning french the problem is that while the words given are elementary the french in the example sentences is not that basic so i am not sure who could use this book,40,45
8906,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,actually i would give this a very low score i just wanted to brush up on my french for a beginner there are no pronunciation guides i do not think that anyone needs to know how to say pimple on the nose,41,46
8907,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,next to useless a very limited vocabulary building book but can be used in idle moments to fill in time for serious french language students forget it cest les crap,31,47
8908,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this small collection of words and related sentences has little to do with what you need in order to speak french,21,48
8909,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,teaches you french words but no pronunciation and the process of downloading the free learning aid did not work because i did not download on my laptop and turn it into a apple file,32,49

8914,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,good refresher but not too much on conversational french expected a little more but was a quick refresher au revoir,20,54
8915,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,should not have bought this book without the audio to go along with it i can not pronounce just from reading and could not keep focused on it enough to learn much as of yet i am sure i will order the audio before long but summer is not the time to study,50,55
8916,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this book did not really help me at all but i suppose you may need more of a background in french than i have if you already kind of know the language i think this would be a good purchase but if you are pretty clueless start with something more involved like rosetta stone or a language class,57,56
8917,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,this book is better for visual learners i liked the ways pictures are presented and examples drawn from each pictures inclusion of phonetics in french could help learners know how to pronounce the word in french,36,57

8920,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,this was useful but needed more of the basics like yes and no or hi bye for the beginner s,20,60
8921,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,it is okay but not enough phrases mostly animals food body parts and numbers maybe getting part 2 helps might even be 2 stars,23,61
8922,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,it is just a collection of nouns most of which are useless unless you like emus and other birds and snakes seriously the product description is hilarious when compared to the content not worth downloading for free,37,62
8923,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,i like learning french because it is fun and a good pastime the book is more helpful i you download the audio book that goes with it,26,63

8927,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i want a simple quick refresher on some basic french phrases but this book was not helpful at all the beginning starts with the names of different animals and has some complete sentences but there is no guide to pronunciation i deleted it after reading the first two chapters to free up space for something more useful,57,67
8928,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i tried it with several others why can not they be like the mexican / latino primmers i gave up quickly try it you may like it i did not,24,68
8929,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this might be a good start for someone who really wants to learn french but if you are looking for something to boost your old high school french or to give you a basic understanding with some guidance for frequently needed phrasing this is not for you you would also be left pretty much on your own in terms of figuring out correct pronunciation just glad the kindle edition was free,68,69
8930,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,but you ought to download the free audio book with it separately from innovative language site the audio only gives the word pronunciations but not the reading and other french limited but ok for free as anof some french words,42,70
8931,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,i thought that if this were an audio book this might not be half bad but then i thought how would i know how to say these words without the abbreviations,31,71
8932,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,still very informative but on limited vocab categories basic words but integrated in complex sentences good for people with existing french background,22,72
8933,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,excellent book for beginning to learn french it has mostly of the basics but it does not teach you how to greet and manners but still a great book,28,73

8935,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,it was too short to be worth even 99 cents but if it is free it can be helpful as it provides a few sentences after each vocabulary word sure some of the words are a bit useless but if it is free I had still recommend it,45,75
8936,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,it is a free book even although it is more like a book for children with animal photo and on but it is free so it is ok,24,76

8938,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this book is only nouns there is no sentence building or anything else i would recommend this to only beginners i have already started learning french and this is not helpful to me this book would only help the beginners of the beginners,43,78
8939,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,i really was not excited about the book it is free although so good to see the words right now i am listening to a french tutor class in my car so seeing the words is helpful also but i just looked at this a couple times,47,79

8995,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this book is great only if you want to discuss bird watching animals or comment on someone has beard it contains and collection of random phrases and words not even the alphabet it also does not contain a pronunciation key,38,135
8996,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this is so useless it is not work the space it takes on a device i could not even use the audio portion for accent practice because the download on the link they provided failed on both my kindle and my laptop for someone who has never learned any french at all this might be a charming lesson in a limited number of vocabulary words that you will probably never use,69,136
8997,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this is the type of thing i read on the train trying to slowly build my vocabulary of french words good for the beginner but not a comprehensive tool for learning a language,33,137

9002,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,i bought this for my son because he is taking french this year in high school for him it was like reading an instruction manual from another planet i tried to go through it with him and to be honest i had about as much trouble as he did you really need to already have a feel for the language and pronunciation to get anything out of this book we also hated the layout but that is just a personal issue,80,142
9003,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i have a very good french vocabulary but my grammar is a bit rusty after looking at about 20 pages i realized some of the translations are wrong i checked with my husband who grew up speaking french and he agreed with me that this is a very poor book,50,143
9004,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,the book is very limited in scope it covers a small vocabulary of words like fruits and vegetables and numbers one through ten it includes short phrases or sentences using the featured words it was not comprehensive enough to be of much help but for a free download to kindle it is hard to complain,54,144

9339,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,i know the title is absolute beginners but everything in this book i pretty much already knew i guess I am a little more than an absolute beginner although I have only used ubuntu rarely and never for very long read this only if your knowledge of ubuntu is that it has something to do with computers if you know anything more than that you are probably beyond this book,67,0
9340,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,1.0,negative,i spent some hours to open the first page of the book without success i prefer to pay a real price and have e real book could you write a simple instruction how to use your kindle,37,1

9342,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,this book has basic information nothing detailed no information on how to use the terminal effectively in summary the book tells you where to go to get help how to install the software and how to download applications not programs from a cd or how to mount a cd ect to install a downloaded program,55,3
9343,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,5.0,positive,if you are looking for a power user guide this is not it this is for computer users that have zero linux exposure,21,4
9344,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,we are talking beginners even absolute beginners why can not some one write a guide for the true beginner novice newbie who only knows how to turn on the computer and interact with ms windows more time needs to be spent on the installation and set up i guess it remains linux is just not for beginners no matter what package it comes in ps i hate microsoft with passion and feel the world needs to switch out of ms and not to mac,81,5
9345,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,2.0,negative,this is 6 versions old from april 2011 this has the basic of basics starts with a overview of ubuntu and linux the whole open source philosophy then how to install and the basic ui if you have installed much software and are failure with the windows or mac ui you have this part the last part is the basic software for the common things people use computers for it is a nice list the install guide is useful the app list is nice that is what this book has to offer if that is worth the price to you you can find the info else where on the net i would not buy this book again if i had the chance,122,6

9349,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,5.0,positive,there are several book like this one available and all are good i recommend reading all of them especially for the give-away prices because there are things that one author will explain that goes over your head but then when you read the same topic in one of the other books it is an aha moment highly recommended so is ubuntu if you are a newbie stick with it read this book and the others like it it is worth your while,79,10
9350,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,5.0,positive,this short book helped me see what the ubuntu operating system looks like and it explained simple to understand questions that i did and did not have at first,28,11
9351,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,it introduces you to the user interface but does not elaborate much a good material to start to familiarize yourself with the interface of ubuntu,25,12
9352,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,1.0,negative,i was quite disappointed in this i thought it would be a good intro to ubuntu once i had installed it sadly that process itself taught me more than this book did it is not much more than a glorified webpage and i felt that i knew more than this could teach me even although i know almost nothing my suggestion is to instead download ubuntu on a usb thumb drive plug into your computer and try it you can run it from the thumb drive without installing it you will see more do more and have a working demo in front of you that will teach you more than this book would this is a good book if you are not sure if you even want to try it or if you are a spouse or friend of someone who is encouraging you to try ubuntu but you are hesitant to try it and want to see what you are getting into first for anyone else this is not worth your time instead just try it,176,13
9353,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,5.0,positive,i absolutely loved the book although all of the stuff inside i already knew but it is an absolute beginners guide i would love to see ms loo write another book a little more advanced say a beginners guide then maybe a guide to linux she has a knack for making the complex simple if you ever thought of trying out linux this is a good place to start,70,14
9354,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,4.0,positive,i thought this book was exceptional it was a great primer for a windows / mac man i recommend this book as intro,21,15

9365,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,1.0,negative,all the information in this e-book you can get for free it does not cover much more than downloading the os burning a cd and putting it in your computer not much on how to use the operating system once you get it installed i would not buy again,48,26
9366,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,4.0,positive,if you are looking for in depth instruction this is not the book you want but if you need a quick and easy introduction to ubuntu and the unity desktop this is it it provides a good overview of what ubuntu is and what you can do with it as well as an introduction to the different parts of the unity desktop and how to use it after reading it you should have enough knowledge to jump in and get going,80,27
9367,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,useful for a couple of introductoy items not very indepth but it does cover the very basics and provides direction on where to get more information,26,28
9368,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,had already figured this out by myself review did not have enough information about subject book will give a basic start to beginners,23,29
9369,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,3.0,neutral,you can read this book or spend the same amount of time installing ubuntu and playing with it you will be further ahead if you choose the latter,28,30

9372,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,4.0,positive,liked the book great for beginners if you are looking for a more technical book then this book is probably not for you,22,33
9373,Kindle_Store,B0079PE6ZY,4.0,positive,I have been a uber-geek on unix and linux platforms for decades I have built expert systems for the us military and civilian government agencies but when i got into ubuntu as a desktop os i knew i was missing some tricks a couple hours with this book can answer a lot of questions for power users and I am certain it would greatly benefit the beginner as well,66,34

9376,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i noticed the reviews are very low but i would not rank it as a 1 what i saw was a lot of mentioning how it rushes through everything lack of development missing more of the story but the story was a short story therefore you can only write so much in that length of the book i wonder if the people marking it poorly noticed how many pages it was therefore expecting more for the length of the story there was enough development to let you know who each person it is a quick read if you have little time i do think you will enjoy it more than the low marks given,111,0
9377,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,shallow plot lousy dialogue and because the story is too short everything was been hush honestly it is not worth the time,20,1
9378,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,no story development and no point in reading story it was too short to go anywhere nor could reader connect to characters,22,2
9379,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,what others have said about it being a fast read is true short story is more like it and i thought then ending was abrupt should have included an epilogue,30,3
9380,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this short story is centered on hutch and trina when trina is visiting their old hometown for a few days turns out that they both have had a secret crush on each other for awhile but could never act on their feelings of lust because of trinas overprotective older brother nash and hutchs best friend they have no such inhibitions this time as nash is not around this story moves very quickly in my opinion it is just okay if you have a few minutes to spare read the book as a nice escape from reality,96,4
9381,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,already home was just okay to be honest thebehind the story line was a fairly good one but it just moved way to fast and felt incomplete one minute they are catching up the next they are having sex and then the next they are going to get together anytime they can find time and that is it end of story but it was free and tolerable so 3 stars,71,5
9382,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,temporarily home in wyoming for different reasons videographer hutch meets horse trainer trina and things heat up with these two childhood friends short sweet and tightly written already home is a fast read that you can actually finish it during your lunch and although this is classified as blaze the sex scenes are tame hence if someone is reading it behind you it is okay,65,6
9383,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,enjoyed the book fast easy pace recommend this book characters interesting and easy to become friends with and to bond with thank you,22,7

9389,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,biggest problem with this book is what most authors are doing now what happened to a book beginning and ending in the same book any other related books were from other characters stories this is getting ridiculous,36,13

9395,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,this is a really cute and fun read it is fairly short i was actually able to complete it in under an hour but i still enjoyed it immensely i loved the feel of the small town and the cute homey names of the stores such as the likity split and the spirits and spurs it reminded me quite a bit of my teenage years that i spent in a small town i loved the addition of a teenage crush coming to fruition later in life i had a similar conversation as a young adult with my teenage crush and although it did not come to such a happy ending as this one i found this story extremely nostalgic i loved the added worry about parents hearing them in the bedroom it added some teenage angst that made the book all that much more nostalgic to me not only was this book sweet it also had it is moments of fantastic humour such as the parents downstairs doing basically the same thing as their children i found the morning after exchange hilarious and was embarrassed for the couple my only complaint about this book is that since it is so short the ending does not have as much resolution as I had like i really wish the author had gone further into the story to give this couple the hea that they deserved definitely a cute quick read for a dull night,236,19
9396,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,enjoyed the story line however do not like abrupt endings so will try another of this authors books to see if it is just her stylr before i make a final decision on putting her in my authors to folloehd,40,20

9399,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,i have read a couple of the sons of chance books by vicki lewis thompson so i knew of the town and some of the people this was a novella about katrina and hutch friend of jack and josie this was a cute story of 2 people who liked each other while in school but did not act on it due to katrina being 2 years younger and was hutchs best friend nashs sister so off limits they are both grown up and the time seems to be right to act on their attraction it was a good romantic book with a cute twist worth the 1read,108,23
9400,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this was a cute short story it was a jump in there quick to the point short story that had room to be so much more if this was rewrote as a stand alone novel i think it would be really great,42,24
9401,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,could have used a little more depth not the greatest book i have read but it is also not the worse,21,25

9406,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i liked how the story started out i liked the characters and their histories i did not however care too much for the way the story ended rather abruptly,29,30
9407,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,I am not even sure what this was it is not a short story and it is not a chapter I am a huge fan of vicki lewis thompson however this was a mistake,30,31
9408,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i was eager to read this story as part of the series it could be read as a stand alone although regular characters are mentioned unfortunately once it got past the introduction it felt rushed and the relationship forced along too quickly trina and hutch grew up together and had secret teen crushes for each other but now years later meeting up again unexpectedly they wish to pursue this they sneak around and get a big surprise the morning after which forces them to decide to cool their affair then things just get awkward until they come up with a temporary solution maybe if this had been stretched out into a longer page count i might have been able to connect with the story or characters but as it was it was just okay for me,136,32
9409,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,they say for no one but apparently it does for langford and trina everyone wonders what would happen if they ran into old flames or someone they wanted to be a flame great read with lots of opportunities for the happily ever after that i love so much,46,33

9412,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,this book is an amazing read i have it on many platforms to be able to read where ever i am,21,36
9413,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,fast enjoyable read i liked both of the characters neither trina nor hutch are broken running from something or in need of saving on the contrary they are grounded adults who understand themselves and what they want out of life living out a fantasy from their teenage years does not change them the goals they have set for themselves or the passion they have for their careers i found that remarkably refreshing the ending therefore seemed realistic and hopeful it tied up nicely but remained true to the characters i also loved the supporting characters and the subplot which was well developed for such a short story I had like to read more in this series and i really want to learn more about robert and lucy,124,37
9414,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,another in the sons of chance series always a good read again for ms thompson love the series but they stand well on their own great story yummy guys,29,38

9417,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,this story was too short and there was no character development and no time to connect with the characters in this story it did not really have an ending it just kind of ended and it leaves you wanting to know what happened to the rest of the story so glad it was free,53,41
9418,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,this is the first book i read by vicki lewis thompson this was way too short i think it could been a better story if it was longer,28,42
9419,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i read through this short romance story fairly quickly hutch is a videographer who has returned to his hometown to help his widowed father run the store while home hutch runs into trina who has come back home for a few days they are both attracted to each other and discover that they both had feelings for each other as teenagers but never acted on those feelings now they have to find a way to make a relationship work as each of them wants to keep their careers where they travel a lot but they can not carry on an affair without some type of commitment as their families would be upset overall i liked the story and characters i liked the surprise situation with the parents and i would probably read more to see how this relationship develops a quick read but it just lacked a little something not sure what there is a love scene but it is not as graphic as some others at the time i downloaded this ebook to my kindle it was being offered in the kindle store for free which in no way affected my review,191,43

9422,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this is not a long book but it does cover everything that other romance stories have in less time trina and hutch face a challenge of having a romance relationship while their window parents are together they end up being under the same house doing the same thing without knowing for sure what is going on i do think love has to be released to know if it is true or just a thing that will blow over i enjoy this book because it was short simple and went straight to the point,93,46
9423,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,i went into reading already home sons of chance by vicki lewis thompson knowing it was a novella for one reason or another i am still surprised to find out some of these are not long i should be used to it by now anyways this one is a very quick contemporary read hutch is at home taking care of his father and his fathers store after the death of his mother and trina is home visiting her mother for the weekend as the story tells it hutch and trina both have secretly liked each other since they were teenagers but out of respect for trinas brother they never dated or confessed their feelings for one another they spend the weekend working out the state of their relationship and certain body parts in the process read the rest of this review at [ ] [ ] [ ] twitter reviewingromanc,147,47
9424,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,totally enjoyed would like to read more about the sons of chance it grabbed me from the very beginning i love a good love story who does not love a cowboy,30,48
9425,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,i do not even know how to start rating this book it is so not what i expected from vicki lewis i was confused if their parents are getting married would that make them brother and sister and when they find out why not end the relationship instead of continuing something that is already doom i did not enjoy this book i almost did not finish it ven although it is a short story was very disappointed,71,49
9426,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,it was really short so it definitely cut to the chase but it was kinda of cheesy and awkward it did not seem necessary to the series and i just did not connect with this one at all i did however like the preview of the next sons of chance installment that was the best part,54,50
9427,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,i love this author but was not as impressed with this story as i have been with others of hers it a quick read thou,25,51
9428,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,i got this for free and it only took me about 40 minutes to read i liked it it was well written and focused on these two characters that always liked each other but could not be together so when they finally can it is great i knew it was short and i got it for free so i have no complaints i like this authors writing style I had be unhappy if I had paid anything other than 99 cents for it because of the short length but definetly worth reading,88,52
9429,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,so i read the reviews a little too late otherwise i would not have purchased this book the story is short knew that ahead of time however it is just a little too short and too the point more like a quick description not a developed story i could tell that thecharacters hutch and trina are obviously in to each other and make it pretty clear to each other right away the book left me feeling like i had experienced a quick one night stand instead of a whole relationship i am not completely disappointed in the purchase but am however glad it was a free offering i would have been quite angered if i had purchased it then found out how short and simple it was,129,53
9430,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,I shall start by saying that I am a fan of novellas short sweet and to-the-point books are perfect for my hectic schedule already home was a great novella other reviewers commented on the abruptness of the book but i think it was great when you consider the length of the book looking forward to reading some of her full-length novels because her writing style was easy to read and enjoyable if the kids are down for a nap or you have an hour lunch break read this it is a cute storyline about going home again and rekindling a romance with that one guy who you crushed on all throughout high school but never dated i think many readers can relate to that and will enjoy the exchange between the main characters,130,54
9431,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i really felt like these characters the male hero is 30 at least the female just two years younger were mentally about 16 the whole way through the book it does not help that the cowboy keeps remembering a time when he saw the woman girl in a bikini at the age of 15 the two have come back to wyoming for different reasons bump into each other realise they each had a crush on the other one as teenagers and sneak back to his fathers house to have sex his father and her mother are also having sex and are planning on getting married the immature dialogue the sneaking around behind their parents back the concern about the heroines older brother the heros best friend finding out and getting angry all too young for me the ending is more a hfn than hea which is fine with me i do not require hea in romances at all but it still felt rushed despite all this i probably would give one of the authors longer works a go but this one did not work for me too short and with absolutely no story,189,55
9432,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with this novella there was very little character development the plot had no real storyline and everything seemed to happen way to fast there was no build up to events also the ending was bad really really bad,41,56
9433,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i have never been so disappointed in a book by this author before until now it was way to short i was just getting into the book and then it was over like i said above it is a good thing it was free or i would have been really upset if i were you i would skip this one it is not worth the time it takes to download it,69,57
9434,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,i liked the book just fine but where is the rest of it it is not finished as far as I am concerned,21,58
9435,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,very short read i loved the premise it is one of my favorite storylines falling in love with the big brothers best friend but i wanted a real ending and did not get it here that is the only downfall no real hea,41,59
9436,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this was ok for a short story the only problem is that i did not realize that was what this was also seems like it would be better if you were reading the series and knew the characters and their storylines,40,60
9437,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,this was a disappointing read the hero and heroine were likable but a bit cardboard even the sex scene lacked excitement and there was no romance to it at all the ending was very abrupt,35,61
9438,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,after reading the reviews on this short story i had to read it because of all the complaints about it being rushed and more of course it was rushed it is a short story people start checking the page count then you will know what you are getting already home was a good read short and sweet a tale about two people hutch and trina who have been hot for each other for some time and when they get a chance to reunite the sparks fly the characters are likable and i could not wait to see how it was going to end i was not disappointed one star no way I have read full-length books that were not as good as this short story it was well-written with proper grammar and i did not find one typo give the author a break it was a short story for petes sake entertaining four stars,144,62

9481,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,this is such a short story that to say much more would make me a spoiler you need to read this for yourself it is fun and it is free so enjoy,30,2
9482,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,5.0,positive,i find real lies very interesting i couldent put it down i personally love mermaids and the fact that they had to get the [ dead ] body is really eerie but when it came alive now that was totally uncalled for but in a good way this author has reeeeeally good talent thankyou for having this book on the kindlefire,62,3
9483,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,4.0,positive,great book but would be better if extended author should definitely continue this and maybe even turn it into a series,21,4

9486,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,4.0,positive,this simple but well-told and humorous ten minute long tale is about a woman who fishes dead bodies from the pacific ocean one early morning she sees an unusual event in the water that she can not tell anyone about because no one would believe her so she has to lie,50,7
9487,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,hmmm this was a very short story and was fairly intriguing but so much more could have been done with it i felt a little gipped by the ending and wished that it had been fleshed out a little more oh well it was free and at least thought provoking,48,8
9488,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,4.0,positive,a neat little short story with a great twist brookss writing is straightforward and easy to read and can be relied upon for interesting original ideas,26,9

9490,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,i dididnt trust the main character and her ability to drive the story and be scientifically accurate the story was very short and it tried to have a twisty ending the narration did not seem believable,35,11
9491,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,all i remember about this book was that i can not believe i spent my time reading it I am pretty sure that it did not have much of a plot and that it was way to short to even get a shot at a plot,44,12
9492,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,it was ok it was weird that charlie was used with the word lay at the end i think it was too short,23,13
9493,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,4.0,positive,i love to read about the mer / mermaids it makes for a very enjoyable read,14,14
9494,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,i would have given it 5 stars because it was really good and i was getting really interested in it but then all of a sudden it ended it needs to be longer i feel as if I have been left to hang outside to dry like for real are they ever going to admit they saw a mermaid do they see the mermaid again what happens nextbut all in all it was pretty good just wishing it was longer and yes i understand it is a short story but for heaven sakes do not leave me hanging a short story still a story and should have a ending,105,15
9495,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,this was actually a short story and not a book but it was a good one it was good enough that I am going to find the novel that she has written and read it,34,16

9500,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,this was very very good well-written very descriptive compelling from the beginning however it does not read like a complete story it reads like the first chapter of a novel leaving the reader wondering what happened to the rest,37,21
9501,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,i think that this short story could have been more interesting i also think that this did not have much to do with mermaids i thought the main character was a mermaid and she had to try to avoid the water so she would not turn into a merfolk,47,22
9502,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,it should be called a sample chapter there was no reference to the rest of the book what was written was interesting would like to see the rest of the story,31,23
9503,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,i want more of the real lies not another love story or evil plot the real lies you started us with,21,24
9504,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,this book was really short the ending was clever but the story was way to detailed i found myself asking okay is it over yet just too many unneeded details that made it drag on even although it was only a ten page book but if it was longer and less unneeded detail it could be a great story,59,25
9505,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,it would have been better if she made the book longer it was actually really good to but worst book of all time,23,26
9506,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,it was over before it began i wish there had been more meat to it not badly written just seemed cut-off,21,27

9514,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,the story was short and i thought it would continue as a mystery and find the creature again sadly it was not as great as i thought,26,35
9515,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,i was drawn in and downloaded it under false pretense but the story was good and short very short thank goodness,20,36
9516,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,make it longer so people can enjoy it and get more reading in and more stuff to make it interesting,20,37
9517,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,i gave this book three out of five stars because although the story is simple and does not take long to finish the story is missing certain holes in my opinion the language in this short story is strong but a bit a mature overall still has the possibility to be better still kept me on thein discovering the mermaids,62,38
9518,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,i thought i was downloading a book involving mermaids what i got was a few pages of poorly written grammar-challenged crap fool me once,24,39

9524,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,it is really short but has a good story line to it i wish there was a part to in the end it could have been linger that is my main point,33,45

9527,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,this book sucked it did not eve make any sense it was a waste of my time do not read it bye,20,48
9528,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,4.0,positive,the book was not long enough needs more details and it can not end right when they find something,20,49
9529,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,this is not a book it is a very very short story it took me 10 minutes to read it took longer to find the book and download it than it did to read the book it is also a very predictable book and seems more like a way for the author to complain about a stinky job than to envelope the reader in a story worth reading,67,50
9530,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,i thought it was ok i would have loved for the book to have been a little but longer just to see what else would have happened,25,51
9531,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,4.0,positive,i liked this i do not think the protagonist could do much more than she did she did not want to end up in an asylum or be the butt of questions about her sanity this is just a review on the plot,41,52
9532,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,5.0,positive,pulled me right in and kept me right there my 15 year old daughter loves mermaids she will really enjoy reading this and I am excited for her to see such a strong confident female character great short story totally left me wanting more,43,53
9533,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,2.0,negative,for the few pages this story was it was good but it left me wanting more when i got to last page i was kinda upset because i wanted more to the story,33,54
9534,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,1.0,negative,i hated this the only information i got about the main character was she was a slob and did not know how to properly answer a telephone,27,55
9535,Kindle_Store,B0085L1GD6,3.0,neutral,i chose this rating because to me it felt unfinished i liked the story i thought it needed more to finish the book,23,56
9536,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,like katherine hannas terrific novel breakdown this shorter work creates a post-apocalyptic world that is extraordinarily atmospheric but not as central as the characters if you are a fan of breakdown you might want to know that in work of the devil there has more action some violence and a more sci-fi feel but the author shows the same beautiful knack for psychological drama what i loved about this story was the wholeness of the created world the relationships among the characters and the tension within the young protagonist as he struggles with unfolding layers of hardship deception and horror in a nutshell the plot revolves around a village that has survived some unspecified disaster and evolved to be similar to the amish of today no machines very traditional gender roles and more they also suffer from health and weather problems in the course of the novella a small group heads north to investigate and confront something that may be causing these hardships needless to say they find it the story opens at the confrontation site and uses a series of flashbacks to show how and why they got there this novella is pristinely written and edited with high production values despite the darkness of the story line the story would be appropriate young adult fiction i think the strong ethical center of both the protagonist and the story may have made me feel that way another great piece from an emerging new post-apocalyptic writer,241,0
9537,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,1.0,negative,after a long time it became clear the characters were amish suspense held for a short while and then it dragged on after finding the machine and creature never explained anything about the sighting after it was found,39,1
9538,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,i bought this after reading breakdown hoping for another great read i was not disappointed at all katy amt hanna has a wonderful gift for character-driven stories the descriptions of people and landscapes are well done rich and evocative without being heavy and wordy she does an excellent job of conveying atmosphere and background and then getting on with the tale for a novella work of the devil gave just enough of a glimpse of the monster to tease and leave me wanting more detail about it however in this case restraint was perfectly played the story is about the boys after all i can easily see this being made into a short film,114,2
9539,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,3.0,neutral,the book is not bad it is good enough to pass the time which is kind of the point of a novella in my opinion it is not complex but also not boring you can pretty much tell how the story will go but like i said it is not supposed to really be the most complicated read buy it if you want something short you can finish quickly that is for a plane or car hopefully not while you are the driver ride,79,3
9540,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,1.0,negative,this story started off well i bought it because it was recommended as a book that might be to my taste unfortunately i felt the author either ran out of ideas or was too scared to make it scarier as should have been the natural progression of the story it died off pretty quickly and limped to a very mediocre conclusion,61,4
9541,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,this was an enjoyable and unique weird western story with three dimensional characters and a solid plot overall the story needed some editing work the story is not told sequentially something someone must have told the author would make it more interesting but it does not work at all re-worked so the story was told from beginning to end and this would be a 5-star short novel i still highly recommend checking it out it is a great way to pass and afternoon and a magnificent effort,85,5
9542,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,possible spoilers this was a very good story i really wish the author had fleshed it out further i loved thethat the boys would continue to search and destroy at the end and I had have loved to know more about the history and religion of the characters so many things were left unfinished what happened to aarons father to eli how did they do when they returned home argh i want more of this story,77,6
9543,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,this is a neat little post-apocalyptic novella by the author of breakdown it traces the adventure of aaron ben eli and caleb as they journey to destroy the devil or what has thought of as the devil in their amish-like community the devil is actually a large black machine of sorts think the monolith in 2001 meets stephen kings gunslinger that is suspected of shortening the life span of their community in the north meanwhile aaron must deal with the emotions of what happened to his mother did she run away as was thought or did his own father have a hand in her disappearance the work of the devil can easily be read in a day or so and i hope it is the beginning of a series for this talented author for so many questions are left unanswered at the end of the book,143,7
9544,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,sat down to read kindle version and before i knew it time had sped by and it was over almost a shock,22,8
9545,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,i bought this book accidentally but thoroughly enjoyed it a real page turner will be interested to read her other works,21,9
9546,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,once you get past the first structual element of flashbacks every section is riviting the book has two excellent climaxes once you think it is all over when the machine is defeated the skill in developing the almost second story of aarons survival is extremely well done most authors would stumble here and aarons story would be an anticlimax but not amthanna she skillfully builds and builds again aarons return and the reader is once more absorbed do not miss this second book from a rising youg author,86,10
9547,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,3.0,neutral,the work of the devil reminded me of patricia anthonys books while not alike in content or tone both feel like nods to the classic sf tale of first or failed contact this novella reads like a treatment for a full length novel instead of a complete story in itself it would work better as a between book supplemental to an ongoing series than it does as a stand alone evocative well paced and beautifully written the work of the devil ultimately fails to explain itself with more questions raised than answered the reader is frustrated at the end still worth exploring for it is fresh take on a time honored standard but i wish the author had dedicated a few more or less pages to her world building the division between the world of machines and the world of simplicity is too stark with little to connect them,148,11
9548,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,it is suspense novella filled my time and gave me something to read it was not great nor was it bad boring a happy ending although,24,12
9549,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,1.0,negative,i had no interest in this book after reading the first dozen or so pages so i decided to call it quits honestly this is one of the few books i have refused to stick with until the very end,40,13
9550,Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,3.0,neutral,i did enjoy this book but felt it was not really portraying this machine as good as it could have been it was a good read just not as interesting as some as the books i have read i did not care for the ending,45,14
9593,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,4.0,positive,not perfect but pretty darn good i definitely think this book is helpful and useful i recommend it being self-sufficient is important these days and books like this can sure help in the right direction,35,0

9595,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,3.0,neutral,this book has a wide breadth of information clearly written it does make some assumptions that are very american but is a useful tool anywhere,25,2
9596,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,this is a book on gardening it talks about testing the soil and more in integrated pest management it defines the three steps but does not tell how to accomplish the third except that some garden ears pick the insects off of the plants it is also written in a different country and alludes to laws not existing here the table of contents does not link to the toc but rather to the first chapter why two stars because it actually provided a little bit of practical information it just had to be dug out i picked this up when it was free and am glad i did not pay for it,110,3
9597,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,1.0,negative,the book description itself is confusing and makes little sense i would have no reason at all to buy a book when the description of it is poorly written outdated the millenium bug really and confusing,36,4
9598,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,great book and for free this book help me get information for my garden project and educated me at the same time what has better than that,29,5

9602,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,you may be like myself and enjoy being as self sufficient as possible this book is a super guide to doing just that you know all those questions you should have asked great grandma and great grandpa the answers to those are in this book you can live through a great deal of economic collapse with a book like this much of the information in this book is from knowledge of people who has only economy was what they could sustain on their own i would not be afraid to sell this one door to door great book,97,9
9603,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,it is a good resource book to have access to through a kindle or ipad while learning about self sufficiency the books can become cumbersome and take up a lot of space,31,10
9604,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,the information was too basic there was not enough info in the book to make it worth my time not at all interesting at all,25,11
9605,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,3.0,neutral,this was a great beginning resource for the survivalist however it was short on detail and just barely scraped the surface it left me wanting more,26,12
9606,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,I have been gardening all my life and there was very little here that my father had not taught me by the age of 10 however if you have never been around growing vegetables this could be a good primer there are some distracting grammar and organizational problems but they should not prevent the books use consider other more detailed books if you are not just starting out note also that this author is from the uk and includes some information about planning permission historic buildings and the like that will not apply to readers in the us,96,13
9607,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,4.0,positive,it is a reminder of the way i grew up and i am starting to believe that we need to return to this to save our planet and our health,30,14
9608,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,4.0,positive,i wanted more out of this book and i plan to find it but this was absolutely amazing just to read i did learn alot,24,15
9609,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,here i found a lot of info about harvesting which is one my hobbies but these like a starting guide because there is more about it is not only about a couple of fruits and vegetables,35,16
9610,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,1.0,negative,this is not a good book it is not even really a bad book either it appears to be some random information on gardening from a number of different sources all crammed together some appear to be from the uk there are references to truffles and selling them for thousands of pounds and some appear to be from the us there has information on the usda growing zones and there has nothing connecting it all it is just sort of tossed together there has nothing even homesteading specific in here just random gardening and mushrooms information that looks like it is been garbled through an online translator nothing about animals nothing about wisely using space or crop rotation nothing that would actually be helpful for a backyard homesteader the formatting is terrible as well with font sizes changing at random it really looks to me as although someone whose first language is not english tried to compile some information without entirely understanding it and added no content of their own for example heres the first sentence of chapter 4 an organic topping that is utilized in the process of retaining moisture in garden soil is garden mulch which is organic it is a bizarre word salad that does not really tell anyone much useful if you were unfamiliar with mulch would that help you understand it any better anyone who a can read english and b read this book would recognize how useless it is please save your money there is nothing in here that you could not find on the internet and in plain language as well,256,17
9611,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,i take no pleasure in giving a bad review but i would encourage the author to consider pulling this book off the market and re-releasing it later with some necessary changes 1 change the title homesteading is a bell jar term that covers many different aspects of the activity and this short book only discusses the vegetable garden 2 although I am certain the author has been successful in his own vegetable garden the overview does not cover a lot of ground for it is price there is no mention of mushroom mulch square-foot gardening raised bed gardening and other aspects of raising ones own food that are considered standard for those forced to utilize a minimum space on a budget 3 where did the chapter on mushrooms come from and although the title mentions wild edible plants it only mentions mushrooms 4 it would help to have the book reviewed by others to deal with typos and stilted sentences nonetheless there are some gems in the book such as putting plants with specific water requirements together the minimum amount of sunlight certain crops need and although never worded in this manner that the gardener raises dirt which in turn raises the vegetables,201,18
9763,Kindle_Store,B00A70QDTA,5.0,positive,awesome i almost came at the end with them overall this was a great book about true milfs i would give a 10 out of 5,26,0

9773,Kindle_Store,B00A70QDTA,1.0,negative,i probably should not have expected much from this but i was hoping the story line if you can call it that is rushed and poorly written the sex is not written well at all the characters randomly go from older woman and best friends son to role playing mother and son not worth my time at all,56,10
9774,Kindle_Store,B00A70QDTA,1.0,negative,not at all what i was expecting i was pretty disapointed and was glad that i did not pay for this e-book,21,11
9775,Kindle_Store,B00A70QDTA,1.0,negative,yea this story was not even a good fantasy it leaves you wondering why as anyone would write such a thing,20,12

9780,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,these are great little page turners the amish may be plain people but their love lives are truly anything but reading these are like taking a great little escape into a simpler time where everything ends happily ever after,39,0
9781,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,amish women do not refer to men they meet as hunky hot or delicious with hunky abs and body to die for besides trudging my way through this then there is the constant mis-naming of the characters first timmy is the child then hank is the childs name but hank is actually the boss but the author forgets that she must have renamed her characters and no one in editing caught this the stories are hoaky and irritating i paid like a buck and they passed the time while riding the bus but wish i had seen reviews that said these are totally stupid and there are so many other authors who capture the amish spirit and lifestyle better than this one,121,1
9782,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,i love to read about the amish romance once you start to tread you can not put he book down,20,2

9786,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,I am a christian and I am intrigued with the amish way of life and the way they raised their children in the simple life,23,6
9787,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,this set was okay some what repeating patterns although i read the whole thing i like the amish romances and the events and how they handle them refreshing compared to what our world is today,35,7
9788,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,the book was filled with mis-named characters flat characters and unrealistic scenarios if you are looking for christian romance for a young girl go for grace livingston hill,28,8
9789,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,2.0,negative,very boring and repititious the first book was ok there was no need to read others would not recommend anyone to read this,23,9
9790,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,these were okay to read but not too logical at times the author jumped from one situation to another and sometimess it was hard to follow her reasoning,28,10
9791,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,have not gotten to read them yet but i love all amish fiction books so these should be great as well,20,11
9792,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,2.0,negative,i did not care for this book of short amish romances which each had a similar theme the stories were really short but almost the same,26,12
9793,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,after living in amish country for almost 30 years i have yet to meet any amish that behave like the characters in this book the inaccurate statements concerning amish life is the only consistent thing in this book at one point a characters mother is dead and then in the next chapter the woman has moved in with them from a nursing home to help out with expenses using her social security first amish do not place their elders in nursing homes and second they do not get social security payments i will not be reading any other books from this author the dialogues were laughable at best and totally unbelievable these people only go to school until 8th grade you would not find them speaking to each other as this author wouldyou to believe nor would they be so free with their talk about sexual concerns save your money and read some wonderful amish stories by beverly lewis linda byler bj hoff cindy woodsmall or several other well known amish authors,173,13
9794,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,while this is a group of short stories about finding love in amish life i found the stories too short and missing the depth i am use to seeing in amish stories these are more like second drafts,38,14
9795,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,this is a series of short vignettes about an amish family and the simple romances of the daughters and granddaughters it barely kept my attention although i did read all eight i would probably not get this again it was very predictable no surprises or suspense,46,15
9796,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,2.0,negative,these books have an interesting story line but are not well written the last one is the worst the names of hank and lewis are exchanged quite often it was almost impossible to follow the author seems to jump around so much from happening to happening and from person to person all of the books have sentences that are not good grammar the intent may be good but the books are not really good,74,16
9797,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,2.0,negative,the author made the characters not appear amish in the way they talked and acted several times throughout the book gods name was used in vain,26,17
9798,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,i love amish romance books and this is another good collection nice for my kindle fire as i can carry several books at one time and read at leisure,29,18
9799,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,book series 1 to 8 about romance and love following several couples relaxing easy reading for the time you just want to forget about the stress of the day,29,19
9800,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed reading it as a diversion but it certainly is not great literature it follows several young couples with their struggles with their religion and with love i would recommend it to young people wanting something light to read,39,20
9801,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,just loved this story line and had a hard time putting this down becca fisher is an excellent author and this is yet another super book by her,28,21
9802,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,2.0,negative,this author needs to do a lot more research on the amish so many inaccuracies plots very simple and predictable,20,22
9803,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,i will not waste my time reading anything else from this author i have never read anything more ridiculous in my whole life i keep being tempted to just delete it from my kindle but i guess i will finish it it is so poorly written there is no way that amish people think or speak this way it would not be decent even if it were not about the amish it is just bad do not waste your time on this author even if you can get it free read someone reputable and spend your time more wisely,96,23
9804,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,this is like a serial novel just a few chapters in each book the story is similar to other amish romance novels by different authors that i have read but with a little different twist this is a very fast read enjoyable,42,24
9805,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,there were a lot of typos and at times the author confused the names of the characters in the last story,21,25
9806,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,i love reading the amish books this series was wonderful and i just wish they were longer for a set that i had to purchase as inexpensive as it was i thought they would be longer than they were i could not put these books down and read them too quickly alas they were so good i read them in three nights,62,26
9807,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,romance novels not for me i wanted a look at amish life did not expect a series of love stories,20,27
9808,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,i chose to give this only one star because it was very obvious that the author knew virtually nothing about the amish the language used in the thoughts of the young amish girls was very modern hunk abs and more in reference to young men not typical amish thoughts or ideas it seemed like the stories were written by a 14 year old how hot is the guy how much i want him oh my god he likes me got him this was not the usual amish story that i am used to reading at all,95,28
9809,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,loved the book was good clean reading exactly what was written i would get love getting books on amazoncom,21,29
9810,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,the way this book was advertised is that it is a set of eight books the two I have read were only a total of about 100 screens which are about a third of a page apiece i also agree with the writing being horrible dialogue is not true to the amish nor are the words used to describe the guys this was also pointed out by another reviewer poor quality and a total waste of my money please make it a practice to give better info to enable readers to make wise choices one star is much too good a rating,101,30
9811,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,i enjoy reading about the amish this set was a very relaxing and enjoyable read definitely a good deal and a good book,23,31
9812,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,i only made it thru 2 1/2 of the 8 stories in this collection i just kept thinking it had to get better i was wrong they are poorly written and poorly researched i think i got this for free so at least i was not over charged but it was certainly a waste of my time if i could give it less than 1 star i would do it,69,32
9813,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,this series would have been better had the storyline been different for each book the same dream over and over and adam and eve living in eden that was just a little much,32,33
9814,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,lovely stories of amish life i could offer a 5 star rating for intent had i not been distracted by so many errors that could have been corrected by a bit of proof reading merrilyjo,35,34
9815,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,2.0,negative,this is nothing more than romance novels which i have nothing against but usually the amish novels don t take to leaving the community it seems to be a typical romance novel with oh bathe way these people are amish but in name only they do not seem to follow the amish lifestyle at all,53,35
9816,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,good book is a typical amish romance book i enjoy the amish books because they do not get dirty or real graphic,21,36
9817,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,enjoyed reading this romance book on life of amish i live near old order of amish familys enjoy reading about how their lives are liked this book good story line and character in story,36,37
9818,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,1.0,negative,i thought this was a great deal as i love amish romances but i returned it because it was seriously awful i have a fairly high tolerance level for mediocre writing but the character envelopment and the dialogue was intolerable i wanted it to be good but i could not even get through the first chapter,55,38
9819,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,loved to follow the family throughout the stories it was quite a page turner good book if you like amish stories,21,39
9820,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,5.0,positive,if you like amish books you will love these books the stories will make you not want to put the book down till you finish i loved these stories,29,40
9821,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,this series of books was very good i enjoyed following the families involved following them through their own trials and growing pains,22,41
9822,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,4.0,positive,books are very easy reading i ordered them for my kindle and have not quite finished them yet i would recommend them to anyone needing an easy read,28,42
9823,Kindle_Store,B00A8HN9LC,3.0,neutral,liked thethat it was a continuing saga it would have been better if the writing and grammer had been edited,22,43
10062,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,the rock star by rick soper is a very competent and intricately plotted novel perhaps at times too intricately at least for my taste it is obviously the first part of a series as a multitude of characters is introduced and their fates followed as they interact cross paths and oftentimes antagonize each other thanks to sopers clear-cut style of writing i have not experienced any confusion but there were times where the sheer number of different characters and each chapter shifting focus from one to another took away from my sense of enjoyment and immersion in the book some plot lines were more intriguing for me than others and the wait to get to the next installment was a bit frustrating making me impatient and at times wishing to commit the grave sin of skipping parts of the text thanks to some tight plotting i remained innocent of that sin as the action would have otherwise been difficult to follow i found the novel to be enjoyable interesting and quite a competent piece yet did not experience the sense of pull to rush to the end which i would have liked to i do have to stress that this is in all probability due more to my reading preferences than to any failings the novel might have because it really does not,221,0
10063,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,the rock star is a mystery story with a host of characters including singer jake fbi agent stevens and teen temptress raven this book is fast paced and attention grabbing right from the start and it remains entertaining and action packed throughout there were quite a lot of characters to keep track of but this is a minor complaint in a book that has been carefully plotted to deliver fantastic shocks and twists as the story begins to unravel i could easily see the rock star being made into a movie it is such a brilliant book the ending just made me want to read more so it is just as well this is only the beginning of a series a thoroughly entertaining read full of mystery horror suspense and even a little bit of romance,135,1
10064,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,fast moving interesting even riveting the author correctly warned me this is not for the faint of heart many twists and turns there are so many persons it would help if there was a listing at the start of the book of major characters for our reference especially if you have been away from the book for a couple of days for a first book this points to many more good and even better books by the same author in the future,83,2
10065,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,good introduction of characters looking forward to reading the rest of the series,13,3
10066,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,v good 1st of rock series kinda weird story cliff hanger but still worthwhile on own,16,4
10067,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,i downloaded the first book and after a slow start somewhat confusing start was caught up in the multiple story lines i literally raced through to the end only to find that it was not a standalone book as a series would indicate i was sufficiently hooked to purchase the 3 book box set so i could finish which i would recommend but was a little annoyed at being misled luckily the initial book was free and the box set was less than the individual cost of the last 2 books i have now finished the first 2 books and started the 3rd all in less than 5 days so it has been a good investment the only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is the serial nature of the books not the writing if they are not stand alone books they should not be sold as such,146,5
10068,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,i kept reading expecting to get anof where this authors story is headed instead you read a bunch of chapters and new characters are constantly introduced as well as different povs to make this a very confusing read this author shows an ability to write great sentences and uses punctuation correctly but the story itself is a jumble the sudden ending left a lot to be desired it is like watching a tv series cliffhanger that you have to wait until the new season to see what happens next i am not sure i am interested enough to purchase the additional books to find out how all the stuff in the first book tie together perhaps if the books show up as amazon freebies i may consider it i gave this three stars as the author knows how to put together a great sentence,146,6
10069,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,the story was intriguing however i missed the part that said the book was a serial and you have to purchase and read all three to find out who done it disappointed,33,7
10070,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,there were so many story lines that did not come together until the end i found it somewhat confusing i did not like that the book ended with no resolution that you had to read the 2nd book and even then i have my doubts that anything will be resolved until the third book i feel the major story line should be complete within each book some minor or lesser lines could be carried thru to succeeding books,77,8
10071,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,why would you waste my time i read the whole story which had real potential then you do not finish the story no ending at all what are you some sort of scammer trying to get me to buy another book from you well a wipe that is not going to happen i advise anyone who thinks about buying this book save your money when i read a book it needs an ending of some sort,73,9
10072,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,fast paced and kept me on my toes this is not a stand-alone book and because of this i was jerked to a standstill at it is ending i can not wait to read the next one,35,10
10073,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,i have just completed this book and give it one star only because there is in fact a story trying to get out my first criticism is that there are far too many main characters i would have needed to have carried a pad and pen in order to keep track of them all in fact there are new characters introduced for about the first 15 chapters however that all faded into relative insignificance at the end i place the word in inverted commas for the simple reason that there was no end no conclusion no drawing together of the various trains of thought the whole thing had more loose ends than a large plate of spaghetti of course there was the incentive of the first few pages of the next volume that clearly carried on from where the first one had stopped however i have no intention of purchasing it only to discover that i need to buy vol 3 ad infinitum / nauseum my final criticism is the regular use of blasphemy totally unnecessary and offensive to many if lee childs can produce the jack reacher series all highly recommended without it i do not see why mr soper deems it to be so essential,208,11
10074,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,only read a little did not hold my interest,8,12
10075,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,this book is rife with misuage spelling errors typos for example principle instead of principal prefect instead of perfect and sheriff being misspelled these are only examples there are many more are editors obsolete i would recommend this book to readers who are not distracted by such mistakes,48,13
10076,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,i really had a difficult time following the story line when i finally got into it the story ended abruptly,20,14
10077,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,after reading the book till the end you will still be in suspense a few rules of the game 1 read slowly and remember the various characters because of the large number 2 there are two separate sets of events i do not know if they are ultimately connected or not 3 you will love the lyrics which are part of the theme and are indeed nice you are exposed to ruthless killing you witness gruesome killing and burning of the victim you are taken through extremely well planned murder of personalities for their past crimes you will enjoy the cleverness of a hacker into fbi what else do you want may be some more will be available in book 2 i will write after reading same happy reading,130,15
10078,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,good plot good stories way too many characters i actually had to make a list so i could keep track of the characters and their relationship to each other the ending sucked,32,16
10079,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,it started out oddly but once you get used to every chapter talking about a different character it makes sense not a book you can put down and remember what you read it is too involved not done yet so not sure how it will end and if i would have given it 5 starts writing is so-so nothing great but the plot keeps me going wondering what will happen would recommend if you like a book that keeps you guessing characters are not really fleshed out as well as i would like,91,17
10080,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,i enjoyed this book can not wait to read the next one,11,18
10081,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,i hated that the book just basically ended without wrapping it up it just ended very abruptly and you do not know who dunnit unless you buy the next book,29,19
10082,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,i am thoroughly enjoying this series the first book the rock star was good so i went back and purchased the series still reading the second one and can not wait til i can get to the third really good read,40,20
10083,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,i had a little trouble sorting out the characters at first but then of course it all came together it was a good read and kept me interested i read 85 books a year and this one stuck in my memory as quite good,44,21
10084,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,weird but i kept reading because i wanted to find out who the killers were however you can not find out in the first book you have to buy the next one and i am guessing you do not find out in that one either and have to buy the third so i have been sucked in because i want to know who it was even although it is a bit odd for my taste,73,22
10085,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,i like the story but it does not conclude at the end of the book so now i have to read the next book rather disappointing,25,23
10086,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,tried hard but could never get into it did not finish,11,24
10087,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,i did not finish the book it took to long to get to a story line and i just lost interest,20,25
10088,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,a really good read believable characters within reason and a story that carries you along i enjoyed it enough to buy the rest of the series what more needs to be said,32,26
10089,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,either i did not get the complete download or the author ran out of ideas or paper the story just quits in mid-stream no conclusion to any of the many implausible story lines maybe this is part one of two total disappointment,42,27
10090,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,good read loved the story line and characters,8,28
10091,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,hated this book and do not know why i kept reading to the end everything was left unfinished there were too many characters and i kept thinking it would all come together in the end but it never did i guess it is supposed to be continued in the next book but i have no desire to read another one what a total waste of my time,65,29
10092,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,great book thoroughly enjoyed this and the next two,8,30
10093,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,the premise was good but it took way too long to start seeing the connections between the many many characters and this really is a set up for the next book s in the series so you learn absolutely nothing in this first book,43,31
10094,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,this is my wifes book so i do not know how she feels about it yet so i give it a lower rating,23,32
10095,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,it was ok too many story lines too many characters i was wore out no ending what I am not buying the rest of series,24,33
10096,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,very interesting read the series should be well worth the time to follow alongholds the readers attention recommend for everyone very well written,22,34
10097,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,it was good enough to suck me into buying books 2 and 3 but there still was little resolution after book 3 if you do not love it stop now and do not buy any more,34,35
10098,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,part of a novel only no ending unless you buy more of the series fool me once,17,36
10099,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,this was a weird book only read 36 pages,9,37
10100,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,the book has a lot of interesting characters and interesting storyline the connections between characters and story are not very straight forward confusingly so the book ends suddenly without a conclusion i am sure part of the intent is to encourage reading a sequel but too much is left hanging i was disappointed in the way the story ended without any connections,63,38
10101,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,i did not realize this was part 1 and nothing would be resolved unless i buy the next book so it was a little disappointing to say the least,28,39
10102,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,this book stinks no resolution of any of the multiple subplots totally confusing throughout no i will not continue reading the series to find out what happened here,27,40
10103,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,think you are getting an entire book and it just stops in the middle of the story never mentioned it was a 3 book trilogy,25,41
10104,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,i downloaded this book for free and am very glad i did not pay for it there are 4 distinct plots going on in the book each plot gets a couple of chapters and then you switch plots it makes it hard to follow especially since there are no apparent connections for the longest time you have a gruesome murder to start with a serial psycho who maims people for their crimes a reclusive rock start who wrecks on the beach and finds a new talent singer / songwriter with a mysterious past you never find out about and a group of drug dealers that are mixed up with russians toward the end of the book there are minor connections being established russians meet rockers common hometown of victims and more but nothing substantial you have a missing girl in the first plot and the last chapter is the discovery of her mutilated body and then the amazon please do not go without offering your review page pops up it was very unsatisfying and irritating i love book series where characters continue and become like friends you know but this was ridiculous it has potential but i will not buy the next book to be left hanging this way a little resolution in the plots would have gone a long way to making me go back for more do not read this one unless you are willing to buy more who knows when it ends,240,42
10105,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,there were some pretty good stories but it jumped around way too much there were also grammar errors that just about made it hard to follow that is why I am giving it 3 stars,34,43
10106,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,darn now i am hooked on this series and will have to read the rest my thanks to mr soper,21,44
10107,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,the book has many separate parts early that later merge into a couple making it an interesting concept murders music and mayhem great read,24,45
10108,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,i love the top 100 free books thatme to stories like this i plan on buying the sequels to this and can not wait to see where theyexcellent story telling,33,46
10109,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,this book is one of many in my kindle library i am currently reading and will get to this book soon love the free books available,26,47
10110,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,4.0,positive,loved the book think will love the series as long as there is an end to it eventually did not know that it did not end with this one book but will buy the others as he has me hooked,38,48
10111,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,there were a few good stories and a lot of good characters going on in this book but none of the stories ended also the style of writing that does not use indents for paragraph breaks is very disorienting and what has with all the commas were they added for seasoning commas in the middle of sentences commas before the last word in the sentence commas just willy-nilly for the sake of adding commas note to editor a comma indicates a pause which is very disruptive when not used properly if this book had been formatted properly proper sentence structure adhered to and the stories had wrapped up i would have given it a much higher rating and for what it is worth i will not buy the next in the series just to find out how these stories ended that is too akin to blackmail comma,143,49
10112,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,the story was intriguing but there was no conclusion perhaps the author felt this wouldme to purchase the next novel it just passed me off one suggestion for the publisher and for many other purveyors of e books invest in a good old fashioned proofreader,46,50
10113,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,because i love a good occult mystery this book grabbed my attention plot involved a rock star fbi local police damaged folks and mutilation killings but the ending left me hanging did i miss something loose ends were not resolved guess this is a series and now i will be forced to read book 2,55,51
10114,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,as many other reviewers have stated there are too many story lines and characters to try to keep track of i did not waste time trying to finish the book since everyone says it does not have a satisfactory ending,38,52
10115,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,it took a long time into this book to sort out the characters had to go back and forth several times lots of allusions to things never explained there was not really an ending had to go back and see if I had hit a wrong button lots of build up but disappointing ending if an attempt to hook reader into buying the next book-fail,62,53
10116,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,mr soper i think your book has some real promise but i have to admit to being very confused each one of the first five chapters reads like the beginning of an entirely different book i kept saying to myself wait what at the 6th chapter i had to go back and re-read the first chapter to make the story cohesive thewas a good one and i would love to see the characters developed a little more maybe give a few of them their own story instead of all of them in the same story with so many leaps,101,54
10117,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,what a waste of time I am glad it was free if i had to pay foot this carp i would have been really mad,24,55
10118,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,the story stopped in the middle without resolving any of the conflicts it is fine to leave something unresolved for the next book but not everything,26,56
10119,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,there are too many characters major and minor to keep straight it was difficult to tell them apart much less care about them two main mysteries and i found myself plowing through just to see how the story would be resolved but it wasn t the book just ended abruptly,49,57
10120,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,i dislike the fact the author chose to end the book before the story ended just to get you to buy the other books,23,58
10121,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,way too many characters in the beginning with no clearhow they all gelled together just not my cup of tea i put this down after the first few chapters as I had lost the thread of the story I am really glad i did not pay for this book,48,59
10122,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,it is a shame that such a well written book ends well it ends with no ending stay tuned for the next one in the series i will not wish instead of calling these a series they would be called serial since that is what they are just like the tv soaps and the saturday matinee movies of past you knew what you were getting i will read the one star reviews more carefully before wasting many hours reading a book that leaves you hanging,83,60
10123,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,i spent four-plus hours following the convoluted plot tried to keep the huge cast of characters straight ignored the lack of editing and then the book ended with no end unfair rip-off cheat,36,61
10124,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,very good but was surprised it had no ending i have to read another book or is it two to find out whodunit,23,62
10125,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,2.0,negative,these books should be called a serial rather than a series this book does not stand alone as a complete story in any way the jack reacher novels are a series this book is nothing more than the beginning of a story most books in a trilogy can stand alone as a complete story as i said before this one does not i downloaded this for free and was happy i had not spent money on it there are way too many characters and at the books conclusion you know very little about any of them it is as if the author is telling several different stories and he does not finish any of them I shall probably bite for the second 199 but I am feeling very manipulated,124,63
10126,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,a good read this was a little twisted at times just as it started to make sense it went somewhere else the ending left me wondering what was going on what did i miss try it you may like it,40,64
10127,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,did not like ending and too many storylines too many people and things to keep up with but al on all a deceit book,23,65
10128,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,enjoyed the book and cast of characters but disappointed that there was no conclusion we were left hanging at the end with 2 unsolved murders and 3 vicious assaults,29,66
10129,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,i hate ebook authors who can not end a story correctly so that it is a standalone book they hope to get people to buy the next book in the series so they can find out how the first book ends i will buy additional books if i like the writing and the characters but will not be tricked into buying the 2nd half of a story that should have been part if the first poorly written characters not fully formed,80,67
10130,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,rick soper has written an ambitious genre-crossing thriller here beginning with the gruesome discovery of a burning body on the carmel beach multiple stories are set in motion and sopers skill keeps each moving deftly ahead of particular interest to me is the flawed fbi agent jon stevens having read two earlier works about him agent stevens sometimes pushes things a little farther than you want your public servants to but he has at a point where rules and playing nice are not as important to him as saving lives the chilling hinted-at summation of the burned body mystery caught me off-guard i truly did not see it coming and i do not say that often the rock star is clearly the first installment of a larger series if you like big-cast high-stakes drama check this one out,135,68
10131,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,having just finished rick sopers debut novel the first of the series i can tell you that you will never be bored there is a series of entwined stories ranging from horror-filled ritual sacrifices to modern-day robin hood vigilante who is dismembering-the-bad-guys my favorite character to a rock album coming together with old-school hard rockers making magic it was definitely not a beach read more like an algebra equation with plenty of variables to solve and exponents to grapple with this book is for the engaged thinking reader,90,69
10132,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,the rock star has the three elements common to all thrillers characters plot and action lots of all three the action is fast and furious almost kaleidoscopic there are lots of characters and they are developed gradually as the multiple plots unfold the plots are complex and intriguing the result is compelling and highly entertaining,55,70
10133,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,i am only rating this as a 3 star because even although it is written very well it is just a little to violent for my taste there are different stories in this book and different characters so it is a little hard to keep up with but the writer does a good job with all of his characters and their stories and keeps it very interesting and at the end of the book the stories stop and since it is called the rock series will continue with another book which i have not read like i said it is a well written book it is just a little to gory for my taste,111,71
10134,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,awesome book fast pace and hard to put down once you start reading can not wait for the rest of them to come great read,24,72
10135,Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,5.0,positive,when i first started this book was surprised at the sheer number of characters and different slants but the action suspense and shocking events held my interest and kept me turning the pages i was glad i did when i found the whole matrix pulled together tightly and satisfyingly in the end a must-read,54,73
10335,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,this book was an easy read to pass time some interesting stories gives you just enough information to spike interest into certain urban legends,24,0
10336,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,not very descriptive but interesting none the less too bad he did not mention the white lady from new york decent,20,1
10337,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,5.0,positive,i have always loved telling stories around a campfire and had heard quite a few of these urban legends before so when i saw this collection of urban legends i got this book almost immediately to add to my campfire story repertoire most of the stories are really quick to read many of them being only one paragraph long and give you the story and a little history about the story i do wish the stories had been slightly longer and more detailed but with 114 stories i really can not complain overall a great read and worth checking out,99,2
10338,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,5.0,positive,i borrowed my friend at works kindle because mine broke and this was on there so i read it and found it to be a very interesting read i like how they include some history with each legend as well as where it is circulating it is always interesting to see what has spreading around the world good work,58,3
10339,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,5.0,positive,i was visiting my aunt in the uk when she handed this book to me on her kindle what a great book kept me interested all the way to the end it was such a fun read seeing all the urban legends circulating in the world today I had recommend to anyone,51,4
10340,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,a collection of hearsay from all over not very interesting at all nothing piques my attention and it only wastes space in my kindle,24,5
10341,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,1.0,negative,this book was just simply awful each urban legend was given all of 1 - 2 small paragraphs even the more popular legends did not get more than half a page the editing was bad and in fact the text of one legend in it is entirety was copied and pasted into the next i am glad i did not pay for this but at the same time I have wasted my monthly free book please do yourself a favor and steer clear of this,79,6
10342,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,superficial off-the-net poorly edited and poor use of language i suppose for free is ok but do not pay for it,20,7
10343,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,i was looking forward to some fun local legends and myths even if i knew it would be silly this however gives maybe half a page paragraph to each legend written with no imagination and very little detail it would be like telling a campfire ghost story in 10 words there has also a ghost people have seen on whatever road and that is it i skimmed the collection and deleted it immediately,71,8
10344,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,4.0,positive,i did not know some of these legends interesting book and good read i like how a little thing becomes a big story,21,9
10345,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,4.0,positive,interesting reading learn how some of the stuff we hear came into being a nice entertaining read fun to learn more factslearned a few things,24,10
10346,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,some things that it lists as urban legends are true stories like the abandoned ship that was found floating at the sea i guess the legend part would be why it happened,32,11
10347,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,this is not the best book i have read but it had some things i have never heard of before and was entertaining several of the myths could have been expanded on to make them more interesting but overall it was worth the time to read,46,12
10348,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,while this does cover a lot of urban legends or in some cases what i would call celebrity rumors i found it to be a bit dry the individual articles are clear and concisely written however i was expecting small short stories or tales so if you just want to know some of the famous urban legends and where they come from it is a decent time pass book however if you wish to be frightened or thrilled by some of the urban legends or the type of story that would be told around the campfire this will not do it,100,13
10349,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,not very well written leaves too many legends unansweredwould like to have more people review and compare notes do not buy get a free kindle app from amazon then download book for free,32,14
10350,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,4.0,positive,while i did like this book i also enjoy obscure myths and legends and there were many of those in town and states of little interest to me i was hoping for more current mythology but overall i liked it and it was worth the money,46,15
10351,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,1.0,negative,very brief legends most people already know it was free so worth a try but I had be sorry if i had purchased it,23,16
10352,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,5.0,positive,very interesting book this book debunks some of the crazy stories that we have been hearing for so long enjoy,20,17
10353,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,i have always thought urban legends were those stories like cancer-stricken child wants to collect postcards from every zip code in the universe or snakes crawling up through the toilets of new york city apartments what i have read of this book about the first 20 pages seems to be all about ghost stories and horror stories teenagers pass among themselves in small towns like the one from my hometown where if you went down to a certain railroad crossing at midnight you could see a headless train man bearing a lantern along the track to signal to the trains or the ones passed among girls at pajama parties about the maniac who attacked young people who were parking and then discovered they were out ofi always wondered if that one was just to keep girls from avoiding the dangers of going parking if you want ghost stories get this book if you want urban legends look elsewhere,161,18
10354,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,4.0,positive,i appreciate the brief descriptions for each legend makes for easy reading i would recommend it to casual readers interested in mysterious stories,23,19
10355,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,as a traveler i have heard these stories over and over again each town claims to hold the one that is true and all others copycat tales I am glad to have this written documentation and seriously doubt it will be enough to convince anyone that the stories they habitually barf onto newcomers is little more than your dads bulls,59,20
10356,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,4.0,positive,it was a great book would have gotten 5stars but each story started off the same also the same story being copied twice,23,21
10357,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,3.0,neutral,i found this book to be very amusing in fact there were a few stories in this book that i have seen on television or in a movie i enjoy science fiction and thrillers this book falls in line with the very things i enjoy and that keeps me guessing,50,22
10358,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,but the writer left out great details sparked my interest but fell short this could have been a great read if he had chosen 10 - 15 legends and elaborated on them,30,23
10359,Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,5.0,positive,this was not a bad book even although i know most of these stories would be something to read to children,20,24
10360,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,2.0,negative,wow story so predictable not even interesting writing was so bad i could not even get through it times i did not even know who was speaking really bad editing and writing,31,0
10361,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,5.0,positive,this book was an amazing start to the series you get sucked in to their story fast and the book holds your attention straight till the end if you like the alpha males and some hot scenes the you will want to check this book out the end leaves you dying for the next book and the rest of their story,61,1
10362,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,i just finished awakened it was good on the fast side there was a lot of similar stuff related to fifty shades it was a good read i can not wait for the continuation i have anwhat jennifer needs to say will read book two when it comes out there has to be a book two,56,2
10363,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,i liked the story although at times it was a bit rushed and could use some editing i read alot and i felt like i read this story before a lot of the elements occur in other books I have read so it seemed a bit been there done that but still not at all a bad read,57,3
10364,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,5.0,positive,super hot can not wait for the next book to come out absolutely a page turner it was like 50 shades of grey but i think there should be more books like it,33,4
10365,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,hot steamy emotional loved this book i already miss stefan he took my breath away at times i can not wait for the next installment holy cliffhanger,26,5
10366,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,5.0,positive,this story is about one hot dominate man i think he could be christian greys brother awesome love story i can not wait for book 2 i want to know what she has gon na tell stephan,34,6
10367,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,where to begin the list is long there are too many little errors it is irritating the writing get tedious the charactes are badly developed the girl is a whimp the guy is so vague he holds no attraction the similarities between awakened and fifty shades are too blatant the maleis a rich womaniser with a death threat lurking in the background an overprotective streak and a tendency for violent outbursts he meets poor misfit girl who happens to also be pretty and they emark on a kinky but intense relationship if this sound familiar that is because it is do not waste your money keep it hug it and save it for a better book,116,7
10368,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,i wanted to give this 35 stars i did not love the characters but i did not hate them i seemed to really like kennedy and ayden would love to read their story i think my issue with the story were the characters or possible the plot at times i found the story to be confusing it all over the place as if it hopped around a lot it was back and forth and not enough meat in the middle it started out pretty good and than fell flat in the middle and then the end picked back up again just enough to make me what to read the second book now when stefan stepped on the scene i thought oh my god caramel eyes dark hair normally it is all blue eyes guys in books now i love me some dark eyes on a man and dark hair i thought yummmyy but than i read he smoked gross a major turn off for me it is a nasty habit that stinks and i just could not get out of my mind how much he prob smelled and tasted like smoke yuck overall it was a okay book and it left a cliffhanger so i will be reading book 2,203,8
10369,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,awakened could have been better it seemed to draw too many comparisons to many other books that i have read in the past 9 months among them fifty shades of grey the story was too rushed and although the couple end up together there is a cliffhanger and now we must wait until the next book to see if they will live hea at this point i do not know if i care i never got to really get involved enough with the characters for a first book by the author it was ok hopefully number 2 in the series will get better I am sure it will be,107,9
10370,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,should have read the reviews more carefully poorly written story did not flow too choppy aside from the sex scenes it appeared as although it was written by a child does not compare to fifty shades at all made me laugh but not because it was funny definitely not worth the money,52,10
10371,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,i just want to say that i have never written a review i read a lot probably a book a day and that is not an exaggeration so I have come across a bad book a time or two i can honestly say this book was absolutely dreadful there were grammatical errors on almost every page biggest offender to too two this story is a cheap 50 knock off save your money and your time,73,11
10372,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,good story line and left me wanting more can not wait for the next book i did knock a star off for the grammar errors it is one of my biggest pet peeves and i found myself having to re-read sections because i could not ignore the grammatical errors,47,12
10373,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,not fair to end it the way they did can not wait to read more they should have at least let her say what she was going to tell him,27,13
10374,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,5.0,positive,when does the second book come out i was so drawn to this book i am really looking forward to the second one it was so captivating i enjoyed every minute,31,14
10375,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,i loved the story but it is very similar to 50 shades of gray one thing i had a very hard time with was the grammar someone needs to go through this book and fix all of the mistakes,39,15
10376,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed reading this book i am really excited to read the next in the series as i understand it this is the authors debut book well girly you have done well i have read many books along the lines of this genre i really liked how this book was focused on the relationship between the main people and did not allow the romanctic scenes to over power the story too many authors are trying so hard to catch the fsog train and they forget about the main relationship while there is a lot of heat in this story it is not another copy cat book the author did a really good job with balancing the relationship emotionally and physically this is a must read i hope the next book comes out sooner rather than later if the author would not mind writing the next book while still basking in the success of this book that would be very much appreciated,160,16
10377,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,i had a hard time getting through this book with all of the grammatical errors it was a tough read,20,17
10378,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,oh boy looks like this author rushed to get this book out for all those 50 shades junkies there is no less than 2 mistakes on each page so poorly written save your money there are much better books out there i can not believe the high rating this received,49,18
10379,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,this was a very good book a lot of similarities to fifty shades but still a very good story line,20,19
10380,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,2.0,negative,i do not like to nit pick but the grammar and diction in this book has me stopping way too many times to even get into the story plus the story line is seriously lacking two stars for effort but i have not finished it and do not think i will seriously who gets hit over the head and is unconsious bound by a crazy ex-lover and then I am not kidding 10 minutes later gets into bed the same bed you were about to die on then the whole thing is forgotten by everyone including the main character too many story flaws to finish,101,20
10381,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,ok so i just finished it and i liked it there were a few plot problems and there was a couple of character characteristics that i was confused about i thought stefan was one way in my head and then he would turn around and get all naughty on us do not get me wrong i like naughty but he just switched around on me some jen i liked ok i did not love her character she held some frustrations with me she jumped to conclusions too many times and i wanted to holler and scream at her to just shut the he shall up and listen ok now to the good i absolutely loved kennedy and her awesomeness as a best friend she was there for jen time and time again no questions asked the story picked up for me three quarters of the way through and as soon as i thought i knew where she was headed i would be completely dead wrong i do not like predictable and it was not the ending very much left us with a ohhh and ok a 2nd book will be coming in the near future which of course i will definitely for sure have to read i will need to know exactly what cn watkins has in store for these characters i see major character growth and development for the next book and it can only get better from here,235,21
10382,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,this reminded me of a really bad fifty shades of grey knock off i enjoyed most of the story but the whole time i was thinking have not i read this story before i really regret spending the 3 on it,40,22
10383,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,ok what could i say about this book then that it was a cheap imitation of 50 shades of grey it duplicated most of the story line the only difference that is in another city with different names and bit of a twist when it come to the story line but more or least is the same thing the dominate young millionaire guy who has a distraught past stefan stefan love interested is jennifer the only difference between jennifer and ana from 50 shades was that ana was a virgin so for those of you that had read 50 shades of grey and want more this is the book for you you have a crazy x with a happy gun on hand mr hot millionaire buying all the good expensive toys for ana i mean jennifer like the expensive car the black berry and of because the masquerade ball and so on and so on and mr hot and sexy stefan just like christian grey he love to play with handcuffs and foggers well you get the picture also the story was rushed that i felt i was about to have a sprained neck it when from one scene to the next in a blink of an eye the only thing missing was the red room but then the book is not finish there is a part 2 so maybe in the next book we had a red room or a blue room who know,237,23
10384,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,i fell hard for the cover art first guilty second was the character stefan jennifer and stefan meet while she is almost a college graduate stefan is a very young millionaire building his empire their relationship reminded me of the movie intersection the way the character richard gere vincent falls for lolita davidovich olivia just that whirlwind feel their relationship had not the entire movie or theme / plot stefan is used to having his way in all things and does not like to wait jennifer on the other hand likes things her way but for different reasons she has a shield up stefan does not let that shield hold him back he goes after what he wants jennifer jennifer is very much taken with him but she is not about to be controlled that does not last long with stefan their relationship has it is twists and turns from a bit of fatal attraction to some dominant play my reason for only 4 stars is at times the story felt hurried i would of liked to know more about jennifers story surrounding her mother and father we only get little bits that almost drive you crazy but in a good way i am assuming there will be another book that will answer some of our burning questions i hope that kennedy and ayden get their own story they were strong secondary characters it would be great to see where they end up with that said i am wondering what the author has coming up next comment see review,255,24
10385,Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,5.0,positive,great book with a 50 shades of grey meets beautiful disaster appearance i can not wait to read the rest of the series,22,25
10386,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,it is interesting but a boring for my taste i recommend this for people who have nothing better to do in the day,22,0
10387,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,4.0,positive,i always think that little fact books are interesting they could have used correct grammar although and i think a few things in here were not facts because the venus fly trap can eat protein because years and years ago when i was in 4th or 5th grade we gave one turkey to see how long it would take to digest it as a science experiment and the trap did not die so I am not sure that everything in here is true but it is fun and interesting,86,1
10388,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,fun facts to know interesting ones too especially about using beetles for red velvet cake to make it red yuck,20,2
10389,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,this book seems like a random collection of facts collected from the internet translated to urdu and back again to english then rewritten by an 8 year old,28,3
10390,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,this book is really awful the grammar is incredibly poor and while many facts appear to be true at least some are not elephants can hear incredibly well in fact leaving everything open to suspicion furthermore many facts are pretty well known to any relatively well educated person fire trucks are 30 feet long seriously does this surprise anyone i downloaded it for free so I have little to complain about but my advice spend a dollar or two or go to the library and read something worth while because this is just a waste of your precious time you can not even use any of these facts to impress your friends since most are either so obvious that you will bore them to death or something you would need to research to be sure you are correct or risk getting embarrassed by your better educated friends,142,4
10391,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,if you are bored with a book and you are looking for an extremely exciting and amazing book you should really try adam anderson 's 1000 interesting facts fun facts to kill some time in this book you will discover how many years it took to discover the moon and so much more so get reading,55,5
10392,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,there were many intresting facts contained in this book some suprised me such as soda being a medicine in the past l wish they make more books like this this book is a one you should definetly read with your family tooit is so funny that you will probably want to read it over and over and over and over again a must buy,63,6
10393,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,i am disgusted and appalled that i paid any money at all for this piece of dreck i honestly do not know what the author was thinking because trivia aficionados share two common traits they are sticklers for perfect grammar and insist the facts must be accurate i came upon a half-dozen facts that were utterly inaccurate in the short section of the book i read which is totally unacceptable if the author wants to stand by the things he wrote he really needs to add a whole slew of footnotes and attributions if he can not do that then the honorable thing would be to return his profit to anyone who bought the book then there has the hideous grammar and spelling if the author graduated from high school he got the diploma simply because he aged out of the public school system my daughter was a better writer in grammar school than this person who charges for his incorrect facts otoh if the author is in elementary school and this is his first try at creating and self-publishing a book then he deserves some gentle correction and a stern warning not to upload any more books until an adult has looked it over first,203,7
10394,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,4.0,positive,this e-book has some interesting bits of information about a wide range of topics i was anticipating it to be formatted differently rather than under a headline with ten subsequent facts listed below there are many typos and some mis-represented information see snakes use of poisonous against venomous otherwise a pretty neat little book,54,8
10395,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,i would prefer to give this no stars at all and get a refund of both my money and my time if anyone proofread it they should be sacked if anyone checked it for accuracy well obviously no one did this book is suitable as a gift only to a particularly stupid child of whom you are not at all fond,60,9
10396,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,what a neat little book filled with fun facts bought it to occupy my grandchildren and ended up sharing these funny sometimes useless facts to get someone smiling on one of those days,33,10
10397,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,this is a good little book for when you are really bored we enjoyed going through it when i first downloaded it i probably would not pay money for this book although,31,11
10398,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,2.0,negative,okay this book was a goodfor something fun to do when you are bored but me being a bit ocd and a grammar nazi makes this book annoying there are so many grammatical / spelling errors that it just drove me crazy the sections of the book were not in alphabetical order or any order really this may not be a problem for you and there actually are some interesting facts in here so if you can ignore these errors this is a decent book i hope this helps your decision,89,12
10399,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,2.0,negative,this was a very interesting book but there were many spelling and grammatical errors some of the facts were also wrong this was an okay book but most definitely something i could have lived without,35,13
10400,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,1st off i did not order this book i was reading the sample on my kindle i was at the end of the sample and i clicked the green download sample button because i actually thought the sample was too short compared to others and it purchased the book ok it is only 299 not a big deal as far as the book goes it is an easy simple ready with some cool facts however there are so many mistakes in the typing that it could not have been proof read i do not know if ifs just on my kindle or what but so many words run together no spaces and a lot of errors like that it has a very unprofessional feel to me because of that it still delivers what it offers but for some reason it bothers me otherwise not a bad book the facts are in small chunks with a title for example the title might be coke or watch and more then some facts about that particulari happen to love books with facts and interesting or odd stories definitely worth the price,185,14
10401,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,without doing any research i know some of the facts in this book are wrong and many others seem too far fetched to be accurate there was no cohesion to the arrangement of the information and the topics were not particularly interesting anyway sorry compilers i regret purchasing this book,50,15
10402,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,not the most accurate facts an anaconda only grows to 28ft not 38 ft the largest snake on record is a reticulated python at 33 ft,23,16
10403,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,i think that this was an interesting book it was a good time passer however i got the book on prime and i would not have paid 299 for it it had several typographical errors similar to thisone it was almost as if certain letters werejust glued together also a note hamsters can not i repeat can not be 200 pounds it is impossible other than that yeah it was okay,68,17
10404,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,4.0,positive,another fun book to help you cool your heels waiting in line sitting at the mall or waiting in the parking lot while your wife shops,26,18
10405,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,3 stars i thought this book was ok but it had a bunch of typos the facts were interesting although i would recommend it 2 anyone who is bored,28,19
10406,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,enjoyed the info in this book had a good time reading it and telling people some of what i learned,20,20
10407,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,4.0,positive,vey enjoyable books this is full of interesting subjects my granddaughter really enjoys reading this and it helps her in some of her classes would higly recomend,27,21
10408,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,2.0,negative,had some interesting facts but some facts were completely wrong there were spelling and grammar errors and it seemed as if the author had a list of some facts typed it out and published it as a kindle book,39,22
10409,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,i was excited to get this book because i love fun facts but i love fun true facts because that is what facts are true i read some of the facts in this book and they are hogwash one that especially tipped me off was the claim that hamsters can reach 200 lbs one silly entry like this makes the credibility of the rest of the book decrease,66,23
10410,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,fun when nothing is on tv kinda short but was an interesting read for the most part i guess worth the download,22,24
10411,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,4.0,positive,if you are a fact hound like me you will really like this book it is set-up to give you facts from a wide range of subjects all in neat order and ready for you to get your nerd on,37,25

10413,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,i enjoyed this book plenty of little facts that you never really think about i will probably read it again,20,27
10414,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,had a lot of spelling errors that were slightly annoying obviously this book was either edited by an idiot or not at all,23,28
10415,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,4.0,positive,it is fun to read short facts about every thing this is great for long trips and times when everyone is not having any fun,25,29
10416,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,i was already aware of about 60 percent of the interesting facts should have done some research on some really interesting facts,22,30
10417,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,i thought that this book would be fun to read but between wrong words and poor grammar i had to laugh aloud rather than focus on the book do not you have and proofreaders,33,31

10429,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,does not anybody hire editors anymore i mean really how hard can it be to read at least a page or two and not leave it to spellcheck to make a mockery of your work,34,43
10430,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,most of the facts were bland and there are many grammatical errors many that my seven year old nephew could spot,21,44
10431,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,so so it is okay to have since it is free the sectioning is okay but they are in random order will probably delete it,23,45
10432,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,3.0,neutral,this book was quite a good one it took me hours to read and the fact that it was a book-o-facts made it just as enjoyable,26,46
10433,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,i really liked this book it was very informational one thing that i did not like about the book was the order it was in i should of been in groups like animals and others other than that the book was very good,42,47

10439,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,2.0,negative,this book does have interesting facts but it is difficult to understand many of them do to grammatical errors and typos i found myself getting frustrated to the point where i stopped reading it I am glad it was free otherwise i would of given it one star if i had to pay for it,53,53
10440,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,5.0,positive,i love learning and this is just a fun way to spend a few mins when i am between task i will reread it many times,26,54
10441,Kindle_Store,B00AQ8W9S2,1.0,negative,yeah there has a reason you are supposed to have someone proofread for you it is so you do not announce to the entire world what year thevaccine was invented seriously do not read this if grammar or accuracy mean anything to you at all,42,55
10442,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,5.0,positive,i do not usually read reviews before i write one but i could not help it this time because i did not believe the low numbers and comments like no depth it was too short and i did not get my moneys worth crystal is a kindle short short means not long it was ninety-nine cents for christs sake we can get a lot for ninety-nine cents these days and if it had no depth then having your life decided by your mother and backed up by an institutionalized god and then you rebelling against that edict is one of lifes shallow experiences i thought the central symbol of the story compelling the portrait of john and the piggish father ryan devastating to me it read like a greek tragedy images from the story will linger in my memory for a long not short time,141,0
10443,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,1.0,negative,seemed to have a beginning but little story and no development at all not worth the 99 cents the only positive i can think of is that there are no editing errors,32,1
10444,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,i chose this book as i like to read work from different authors i was not let down it is a really interesting and well written story,26,2
10445,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,1.0,negative,story starts out very interesting but i could not believe it was so short it really left you hanging wondering what happened i felt the author just quit writing half way through the story,33,3
10446,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,the story itself was very good but it was too short it would have made a better novel i felt quite dissatisfied at the end as there could have been so much more depth to the characters and the plot,40,4
10447,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,despite the negative reviews you should give this story a read it is spare in it is style never wasting a word or an image an young irishman is drawn to priesthood by the sheer will of his mother what are the consequences of breaking free there is an old saying among priests the true test of your vocation is if it outlives your mother in this story a young unhappy priest finds he can not wait so long,75,5
10448,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,1.0,negative,amazon reccomended this book for me not sure why since I have never read anything about being a catholic or wanting to be a priest but it was terrible this book is missing a story arc just when it gets interesting and the central character starts to become someone you could care about the book ends waste,56,6
10449,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,john was born the first boy after five girls his mother had always known he was destined to be a priest and he accepted his fate then one day he asks a girl to walk out with him the sin burned up inside him and yet never burned out as is the way with sin still he takes the ride to the seminary although it felt like a hearse i found the short cameos of john his family and his friends to be lovely the story of the priest at war with himself is told in clean sparse language the despair is conveyed without drama but with depth i recommend this story,112,7
10450,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,1.0,negative,i have never written a poor review before and it pains me to do so now but i simply can not give this story a favorable review i am so disappointed because i love stories about the priesthood the calling and the sacrifices people called to that life make but this story fell flat on so many levels firstly it was poorly written it was very choppy there was no flow whatsoever it bounced around so much that i had a hard time keeping track of which character the author was talking about or where the character was there were times when the author seemed to change direction mid paragraph it was almost as if she had lost her place or forgot what she wanted to say but kept on writing there were scenes that went nowhere they just trailed off secondly there was little to no character development i knew no more about the main character at the end of the story than i did in the beginning lastly i found the protagonists life changing choice at the end of the story to be totally unbelievable he makes a decision that forever changes the path of his life over something so minor most people would have considered it an annoyance at the most throughout the story there is frequent mention of another character a woman who is a friend of the main characters sister she is mentioned enough that i believed she would play a large role in the main characters life and in the story but then she just seems to disappear i realize it is difficult to build characters and wrap up a plot in a very short story perhaps this was a story that begged to be a novella,292,8
10451,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,the story line has a leveled beginning that is an excellent vehicle for development unfortunately it just sits there if the setting has significance it is obcurred by passing references to bucolic pastoral senery followed by swift shifts to the worst examples of post-industrial age urban decay the characters are static and even the main character remains single-dimensional the introduction of the mystery woman offers several opportunities for adding depth to the priests character but this woman just fades into the background with no evident reason for introduction i am still waiting for the significace of the crystal,99,9
10452,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,3.0,neutral,overall it was an ok read but just dveloped a little slowly for my liking and the end was a bit anticlimactic and abrupt,24,10
10453,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,I am assuming the negative reviewers are used to reading standard popular / genre fiction what makes this story interesting is the motivation of the characters not the plot i enjoyed reading the main characters experience of following others expectations which eventually leads him to the discovery of his own free will this is the first time I have read anything by susan hill and i plan to read more of her work in the future,72,11
10454,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,3.0,neutral,it was a quick read i do like a good short story after a few long novels because of the brevity of the story not all characters were as developed as they could have been,35,12
10455,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,no one really thinks about the loneliness of a calling mainly i guess because it usually is someone elses life we are discussing it is all well and good when it is your calling and your heart is completely given over to a life of solitude and sacrifice but as in this case when it is some one elses call on your life and you accept it out of a sense of duty it seems that it would be intolerable this young man finally had the courage to leave while he still could how ironic that he must live with guilt and end up so alone this was a well written and very unusual look at the life of a young man who finally had the courage to do the right thing only to find that it was too late starkly honest,141,13
10456,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,this was a disappointment book was too short and rather depressing the story never really got off the ground,20,14
10457,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,this story was well written for the most part but it seemed rushed to a premature conclusion it could have been so much more fully developed i wanted more,29,15
10458,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,susan hills story story crystal lacks her usual depth found in her novels i liked how the ending was tied to the tittle,24,16
10459,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed this book but it did not have a satisfactory ending i expected to know what happened after he left the priesthood it was disappointed not to have an ending,30,17
10460,Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,3.0,neutral,i felt that the plot lacked substance i anticipated reading more i did not care for the very abrupt ending,20,18

10537,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,5.0,positive,i really liked the way everything was taken into account it was interesting concise clear and helpful after reading this your visit to the belrin wall will be more memorable,30,1
10538,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,4.0,positive,this is a concise but very detailed book on the history of the berlin wall from it is erection up to the moment it was torn down in 1990 researchers will have a great time using this as a resource for their academic work particularly since it is packed with information minus the unnecessary fluff that weakens a lot of historical books today the only thing missing is a more nuanced discussion of the native german reaction to the upheavals in the country from the end of the war leading to the developments that created the berlin wall both east and west germany had their government representatives but the book was far too focused on the actions and responses of the four occupying forces and left much of the german politicians reaction out,132,2
10539,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,5.0,positive,i was stationed in germany from 83 - 86 and was fortunate to take a week tour to both berlin and east berlin i bought this book for the memory i have of the place the book is a good read,39,3
10540,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,2.0,negative,i was paid to review this book via the website odesk around 3 years and it was quite a chore to get through the information was good but it was full of typos bad grammar and was very poorly organized i would discourage paying for this book and instead picking up a history by a real historian instead of one by someone regurgitating what they have read badly and not in their first language i assume when i originally wrote the review i praised certain aspects of the book and denounced others but now 3 years later when i went back to look at my review it is different than what i originally wrote and only praises the book what would someone other than me be able to change it here is what apparently has been on amazon and i do not have a record of what i originally wrote this very brief history does a good job of presenting the causes and effects of the division of post-wwii berlin leading up the berlin wall and it is destruction black smoothly integrates all of the important themes throughout his narrative diplomacy policy economy and society without losing the reader in the complicated chronological progression there is also a pleasant peppering of stories of how people dealt with the wall and tried to cross it this is definitely a easy way to familiarize yourself with one of the most important events in international relations,239,4
10541,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,1.0,negative,it seemed that i was reading a 7th grade research paper a total rip off many typos and grammatical errors do not waste your money,24,5
10542,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,3.0,neutral,there were several typos and although the title stated a very brief history i did not expect to read some of the same stuff over and over again within the book,30,6
10543,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,3.0,neutral,if you are planning a vacation in germany and want to visit the exciting city of berlin this is a good introduction to the history which is still part of the german peoples lives and opinions a little insight to a time when west berlin was isolated from the rest of germany follow the path of the wall through the new city it is marked on the road but we never learn a new wall has been built between palestine and israel maybe one day we will buy a piece of that one as a souvenir,95,7
10544,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,2.0,negative,very poorly written and superficial i would give it 1-star if i had to pay for it but as one of the free kindle promos i gave it two stars instead there are a lot of these very brief histories produced by this author and apparently judging from the reader reviews this is his style,55,8
10545,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,3.0,neutral,some info was new to me so it is worth four stars short story format not at 3 for me to buy,21,9
10546,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,4.0,positive,I am in berlin frequently on business and wanted to read up on the history of the city obviously starting on the wall would be one of the main things to read about at 3 this was a nice informative read that had good tidbits on the wall and the falling of recommended if you want a quick concise overview,59,10
10547,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,4.0,positive,very succinct but informative makes me want to read deeper now i recommend the whole series as well as i have found them to be good,26,11
10548,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,2.0,negative,quite a few typos these books are good for middle school maybe even high school i sometimes think that these books are really someone 's homework assignment and i wish i had a red pen,34,12
10549,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,3.0,neutral,quick read to get the basics on this subject reads kind of like a textbook worth the time it takes to read,21,13
10550,Kindle_Store,B00AXLC2ES,4.0,positive,concise and compact full of facts recommend to all my fellow cold war history nuts give this book a read,20,14
10551,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,just when we need him most here comes gore vidal with a slim but deep look at our nations beginning vidals elegant waspish wit makes this book along with everything else he writes a delight but the true value of this work lies in it is content vidal makes it clear in his afterword that the book was inspired by a brief conversation he had with john f kennedy in november 1961 kennedy wondered why we had no great men of the caliber of the founding fathers in his own time how depressed he would have been had he lived forty more years and witnessed our present crop of leaders vidal does not really give us a clear answer to kennedys question but he does manage in less than 200 pages to remind us of both the founders human frailties and their greatness with vidal washington adams jefferson franklin and many others do not come out as icons but neither are they the villains some would make them one finishes this book in an hour or so aware that the men who created our nation were human after all but intelligent and dedicated men who compare rather well with their successors in 2003,200,0
10552,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,you would think that an historian especially a distinguished one would know better than to constantly diverge into politics when writing good history if you like gores political views you will like this book otherwise you will not i do not mind his political writing when it is sold as that but this was supposed to be history,54,1
10553,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,i was disappointed in this book it did not have the clarity and focus of other gore vidal histories i have read i found it rambled a lot was confusing and appeared disorganized there was no clear timeline,38,2
10554,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i enjoy reading books about the founding of america i thought that was what this book would be however he makes the common fatal flaw of interpreting historical figures using modern standards also he has the annoying habit of jabbing at george w bush throughout the book i was not the biggest fan of gwb but this had no place in a book of this topic i gave the book to goodwill,71,3
10555,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,short on new facts not cohesive not an interesting or captivating read filled with the authors unsupported comparisons to present day events i listened to it 3 times consecutively and feel the same not nearly as good as for instance john adams by david mccullough,45,4
10556,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,the following comments are for the unabridged audio book version of inventing a nation of particular interest is a fascinating afterword spoken by author gore vidal in this relatively short book i noted that the page count of the print version is 198 gore vidal attempts to place his literary arms around the efforts of those three principal actors in our early national drama washington adams and jefferson this is by all accounts a book of non-fiction but i find his style very similar to his fictional prose extremely fascinating and sometimes very frustrating that comment is based upon my limited reading of his historical fiction burr 1876 and lincoln trust vidal to highlight some the historical oddities that can challenge our uninformed assumptions washington gallantly waiver his salary as commander of the continental army but after the war submitted his bill for personal expenses of 100000 our bloody enemies the mercenary hessians married local girls western pa and delaware hence the many german family names found in those areas vidal broaches the rumor the hamilton was washingtons illegitimate son after all gw did visit the bahamas once the anti-catholic pope-hating yankee protestants thought an invasion of canada in 1776 let by the redoubtable benedict arnold would be a resounding success after all would not the popish frenchmen rally around the new englanders against the british oppressors vidal has a keen facility for discerning the eccentricity of human nature his insightful observations breath life into the founding fathers a fascinating read or listen recommended,255,5
10557,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,gore vidals historical novels give me enormous pleasure and so i was looking forward to this book and to learning more about a very important period in the nations history it certainly debunks the conventional myth especially cherished in the state where i live of great statesmen producing a divinely-inspired constitution which has never been bettered and probably never can be i am not a good enough historian to judge the accuracy of vidals account of the infighting and self-interest that lay behind the facade but it is a plausible and very entertaining tale which provides an incentive to explore the topic further however there are two defects which spoiled the book for me one is minor my hardcover copy suffered from bad editing or proof-reading or both and contained too many immensely long sentences which seemed to have lost their verbs or perhaps even a complete line and punctuation so i was frequently re-reading to try to extract the meaning the other to my mind is fatal the incessant acerbic attacks on present day that is 2003 politicians especially the bush administration and in some cases on dubya himself of course future historians will puzzle over the attacks on constitutional rights that followed 9/11 and why the public tolerated them but the causes and appropriate responses to real or perceived terrorism are complicated and contentious this is an issue that needs greater perspective and much deeper analysis the snide comments in this book are more of a superficial and irrelevant distraction than a serious contribution the final three pages recounting a conversation with jfk 40 years ago seem purely snobbish name-dropping although they also give vidal space to observe that thinking is something no longer done in public life sadly this says more about vidals arrogance than anything else,299,6
10558,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,this book is a sorry attempt to trash the founding fathers of the united states of america it is not worth the time of reading it or the money spent to buy it,33,7
10559,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,this work was my introduction to vidal and frankly i was not impressed while somewhat well researched much of it is vidals personal opinion and sounds oddly like a more hardcore republican party revisionist take on the constitution and the founding fathers than one might imagine from someone allied with the democrats his arrogance on the subject makes it almost laughable vidals writing style is choppy and disjointed in places the whole work is entirely unsatisfying,76,8
10560,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,inventing a nation by gore vidal is a concise and clear analysis of the development of the united states of america and how the decisions made in the late 18th century impact government today gore vidal cuts to the chase he destroys the myth of american democracy by revealing the constructions of the constitution the formation of the three branches of government and the development of the electoral college at times vidal can be didactic and not everyone will agree with his suppositions i checked this book out from the library on cd then read the librarys print addition now I am purchasing a copy for my mother to read and to pass on to others i highly recommend this book,120,9
10561,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,i was never enthralled by this book not a history buff i was not thrilled to learn of important concepts with little flippant comments to entertain rather than educate with elaboration he has some flair for the dramatic interactions whether exaggerated or not among characters the three main hamilton marshall franklinhowever they are not developed or enriched with further explanation i giving him two stars grant him the benefit of the doubt that he had to invent the nation with only 177 pages but this is far too limited he emphasizes discord and elements of struggle for one principle and it is inventor over another rather than collaboration among fellow patriots clearly it is important to see the contrast of one party and patriot against the other but it is overemphasized or just not fully explained to give any nuance he is strictly secular in the invention of the nation which for me limits it further altogether if you have started reading it by all means finish it if not skip it I have heard his other works have more merit however,182,10
10562,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i admit that i have not finished the book yet and i may not i picked this up from the library expecting a book about the founding of the united states with respect to our first three presidents while that may be in the book the book is primarily an anti-bush diatribe i am not one to defend president bush but i can not stand intellectual dishonesty in the book vidal states that invading canada in response to 9/11 made as much sense as invading afghanistan while the issue of invading iraq is and continues to be a controversial one there has been very little opposition to our invasion of afghanistan our current president obama has stated many times that our fight against terror was in afghanistan and not iraq for vidal to state that afghanistan had as much to do with 9/11 as canada comes across to me as intellectually dishonest his hatred of president bush has made the book almost completely unreadable in my opinion,166,11
10563,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i love reading about the founders and i have been studying early american history for several years trying to make out the character of jefferson in particular this book was not a big help in that regard it merely reinforced the popular portrayal of jefferson as a man who used wishful thinking in place of reason jeffersons philosopher king act was a front for a self-delusional aristocrat as gore vidal makes clear it is too bad i was hoping for a better glimpse of jefferson and what made him great this book is stale and tired in depth it is not much more than 1776 the musical vidal has not kept up with research on the founders and his characters are more like caricatures vidal is oblique and wordy making me wonder what does he think he is talking about he seems to obscure his meaning deliberately dropping hints and insider jargon making vague generalizations perhaps if his readers realized what he was trying to say they would accurately conclude how poorly-formed his ideas are in the end you sincerely hope that this was not the best vidal could do you hope this was an ignorant and indolent slurring of history put forward mainly as a way to get the publishers advance on the book rather than the best product of his highest ideals i shudder to think that one of the icons of modern american literature might produce such rubbish if he were working in earnest,248,12
10564,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,a snippy opinionated disorganized presentation that causes one to question the credibility of the information after just a few chapters,20,13
10565,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,i had never read a gore vidal book before i was looking forward to it and even enjoyed the first twenty pages or so then vidal starts manipulating history i had nowhy he was distorting things until he went off on his tirade about corruption and the 2000 election that has no place in this book i actually agreed with most of vidals points about corruption in current government but there is no excuse for his manipulation of facts he guesses at motives or makes them smoothly fit into his ideals the more i read the more insane vidal became making absolutely stupid conjectures about the founders actions and how they would look shamefully upon this america when they lived in an america where tarring and feathering was common there are much more accurate books on the foundation of the country and much better books about the current political climate vidals corruption of history is despicable,158,14
10566,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,can i get my money back please this book was a joke and waste of my time,17,15
10567,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,looking at the front cover of this book i had big hopes for a such a work written by historian legend gore vidal but honestly I am horribly disappointed now sitting at the other end of the cover yes vidal does cover his historical data well and even having read other works recently about the same era i did learn new things however vidal also uses this text as a forum to inject some of his own political views through partisan commentary on current events i understand our past colors our future and vice versa but i wanted a book that covered the scope of history not one that told me how we were all modern day heathens in the throes of sending our forefathers turning in their graves at the disgrace we have become i do not agree with all of mr vidals current day political positions and having to be beat over the head with how horrid we have become and the despotism of any one not in line with his personal political views got tiring if you rip out the rhetoric and personal observations more befitting a political commentary the history lesson in and of itself is a worthy read on it is own merit if you can not over look that aspect although find yourself a different book on our founding fathers,220,16
10568,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i thought i loved history but maybe because i did not graduate from harvard i was not able to find any excitement in vidals history lesson it felt more like a lecture than anything engaging if only dave berry can collaborate with vidal then we may have something,46,17
10569,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,this is the first book i have read by gore vidal this is probably not his best work but you can see his political leaning in his writing in his view our present system is a tyranny especially with the 2000 election in mind in this book he takes a negative view of our founding fathers perhaps other authors have made these men mythical but vidal returns them to the human species they were men who made mistakes none of them were perfect however i think vidal is overly negative in his viewpoint of these men they founded a new nation with great principles the author jumps around quite a bit in this history he also has some new history with the revelation of hamilton as a british spy i think the author came to that out of his own conclusions this was a uneven read and some of the language was difficult to understand maybe someday i will appreciate his writings if i adapt his poltical philosophy,168,18
10570,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,arch-iconoclast gore vidal who made his name as a novelist tackles non-fiction here and does a fine job of it this short and straight-to-the-point book hits us history head-on and peels back the dust and whitewash to show americas authentic greatest generation those who fought the revolution and then created the nation in the 1780s as it surely was walking a fine line between respectful praise and candid revelation vidal introduces washington adams jefferson hamilton and others as no history professor probably ever has this book is not a slam biography of anyone nor is it one of those tedious lambasting of our national institutions that too often masquerade as warts and all history no vidal shines here in this story of the events behind the time-worn legends in early us history i personally found much to like in this book and discovered a last gem hidden in it is closing pages as vidal describes a moment of relaxed conversation with his friend and distant relation by marriage president john f kennedy on that day shortly before the presidents brutal murder kennedy turned to vidal and asked how it was that so many great men all lived at once in the generation that formed our nation vidals one-word answer was unique and while as he freely confesses not comprehensive it was good and it is left me pondering it on more than one occasion since i read it i will not say here what that answer was but you will find it in the last chapter of inventing a nation and it is worth seeking out,261,19
10571,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,listen i like gore vidals work i do and he is probably right about a lot of things although i seriously doubt his frequent inuendo that hamilton might have been washingtons illegitimate son however i can not help feeling like his attitude came through so much that it was distracting me from what he was saying i listened to this book unabridged on audio book perhaps it was that gore was reading it himself and i got a real sense of how he felt about things rather than the history he was trying to convey i do not know but to vidal everyone was and is of sinister or selfish intent except his friends the kennedys and ben franklin that is just the feeling i got the audio book is worth the price of admission if for no other reason than to hear vidals recount of a conversation with jfk at the end of the recording seriously that part I shall give five stars,159,20
10572,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,inventing a nation is gore vidals witty and irreverent look at the three main characters george washington john adams and thomas jefferson who together and in competition invented the united states reporting the contributions strengths and faults of each vidal carries the early years of our country from the revolution through the louisiana purchase and on to the end of the founders era with the death of adams and jefferson on july 4 1826 besides the three main characters the reader also gains insights into the roles of lesser players such as alexander hamilton john jay aaron burr and john marshall particularly as they shared scenes on the world stage with the main characters i found this book to be both entertaining and irritating vidals unusual ability to turn a phrase keeps this book moving along at times vidal suddenly shifts from events early in our history to current political topics vidal has a way of presenting his impression of current issues as universally accepted fact an example of this is hisfrom a discussion of the alien and sedition acts of the adams administration to contemporary anti-terrorist laws which vidal sees as similar infringements on civil rights this i find irritating i did gain some insights into new ways of viewing individuals and developments in this portion of our history although i can say that i found other books to be more informative because the new material was relatively sparse and the cheap shots at modern policies so irritating i seriously considered giving up on this book before completion something i almost never do on the balance i am glad that i stuck with it but knowing what i know now i am not sure that i would start it,292,21
10573,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,this is the first book l have read about some of the major founders of the american republic and it will not be the last it has whetted my appetite to dig deeper and seek out some history books worth reading to tell me more at times l thought l was reading a series of articles from a psychology today magazine as the author delivered his judgments on everyone and everything in this period of american history but he did it with such wit and perception that l was both intrigued and stimulated by this book as an outsider looking in this book brought washington jefferson adams and more to life and l was able to form pictures of them in my mind as their lives decisions and relationships are described in this book it is amazing that men with such diverse interests backgrounds and ideas could forge the beginnings of a republic and achieve a unity and common destiny that has endured to this day this book is a warts and all presentation of this time in history and it is players however it is a good start for an introduction to the republics founders and to gain some insight overall it is more reflections and comments from the author than history so one needs to read wider and deeper the foundation of the american republic has so intrigued me i went out and bought american sphinx and founding brothers by joseph ellis adams by david mccullough and crucible of war by fred anderson i am sure this will be the start of a wonderful experience,265,22
10574,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,this sub-200 page book imagines the passions of and conflicts between the brilliant but flawed founding fathers mostly george washington john adams thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton vidal covers the forming of the constitution inaugral presidential terms of george washington and the subsequent battle for succession between the federalist adams hamilton john marshall and republican jefferson james madison factions hamiltons story is perhaps the most colorful vidal insinuates that he is washingtons illegitimate son and accuses him of subterfuging john jays postwar treaty with the british repeatedly labeling him agent number seven and sabatoging adams political career the book also explains several important events of the early republic like the alien and sedition acts and marbury v madison vidal includes quotes from vintage letters and other sources but also peppers the text with critical screeds against the current administration and it is policies which may distract or annoy some readers a passage from senator maclays diary describing thomas jefferson in 1790 also fits vidals book he spoke almost without ceasing but even his discourse partook of his personal demeanor it was loose and rambling and yet he scattered information wherever he went and some even brilliant sentiments sparkled from him this was my first full gore vidal book and it interested me in reading another recommended for those planning to visit the historic sites in philadelphia,226,23
10575,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i borrowed the audio book set of this book not knowing anything about it is author or his political views hoping to get a greater insight into the minds of the founding fathers unfortunately what i found to be the most prominent subject matter of this work was the anti-bush / republican propaganda now i do take exception with many of the policies and stances of the current united states presidency however if i wanted to research the effecacious practices of the current presidency i would have rather borrowed from my library a politically motivated work i for one find no place for such subjectiveness in a work on what is supposedly historical truth i prefer my history books to simply contain history not political commentary,122,24
10576,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,gore vidal whose radical political views are well known attempts to tell the genesis of this republic he focusses on the first three presidents washington adams and jefferson he however gives supporting roles to hamilton madison and monroe vidal does not move chronologically instead he jumps through events granting him freedom to pursue his prose style he covers all the major incidents in the life of the young nation filled with lots of history and biographies enlivened with acerbic commentary one learns from this book in inventing a nation vidal challenges us to confront some of the unpleasant parts of our past he infers rightly that the founding fathers after the revolution became the very evil they were fighting against however he concludes wrongly that this resulted in a contradiction i beg to differ the nation magazine which i believe prides itself on supporting freedom of speech in a recent edition chastised fastfood companies for dishonest advertising to them it is no contradiction i do not fault them neither do i fault the founders there are other remarks i oppose in this book like in page 136 he claims that the electoral college thwarts the majority rule and is therefore undemocratic this is true yet it is not right because it is possible for the majority not to represent the nation i would rather prefer the electoral college than tocquevilles tyranny of the majority what must be appreciated is that the experiment the founders indulged in was debated on intellectual even ideological grounds inventing a nation exposes the depth of banality in politics today regardless of it is sweeping generalizations it succeeds because it forces the reader think anything less the author should have saved the trees,286,25
10577,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,gore vidal does an excellent job of bringing some of the key founding fathers to life in this book laying bare their ambitions their foibles but also their genius an extremely worthwhile book that will leave you excited to read more about these great men,45,26
10578,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,I have never gotten around to reading any of gore vidals novels but his non-fiction and history are dynamite this recent offering is a colorful and human rendition of our countrys formative years the interplay between the giant figures of our nations birth washington hamilton adams jefferson franklin marshall and others is fascinating and illuminative of our contemporary struggles and rather than come down decisively on one side or the other federalists against republicans vidal is careful to lay out the nuances of each position although hamilton does come off as a main villain in many ways perhaps most intriguing is the dynamic of jeffersons trust of popular wisdom he expected the american constitution to be torn down and rebuilt quite often as scientific discoveries added to the great body of public knowledge after all who wants to be in thrall to a beclouded past franklin also expressed the view that if unchanged the political arrangements of the united states would result in a course cruel and unjust society as recent times demonstrate theological devotion to a piece of parchment scrawled by a hoary generation can result in social and political ridiculousness we perhaps need more jeffersonians and franklinites today who are willing to jettison cheap patriotic fealty to the founding fathers in favor of a renewed trust in popular power and wisdom we clearly could use a new constitution updated for the concerns of today the present version was conceived as a protector of privilege and it functions the same today,251,27
10579,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,gore vidals witty snide snobby sarcastic style of writing is very entertaining and even his critics have to admit he knows his history in this short quickly read book he demonstrates beyond doubt that our nation was founded not by saints but by aarray of men with mutiple interests visions egos and agendas the miracle is that a flexible system of government was forged from this complex interplay of lofty enlightement philosophy with base ego centered self interests vidal brings historic characters to life with tiny details for example abigail adams becomes disqusted when benjamin franklins mistress feeds her lap dog from the dinner table while washington is urging that the flimsy articles of confederation be replaced with a constitution he and his mother have a falling out the book is full of these personal touches that bring the historic characters alive in the mind of the reader the team work of these early founders despite their disagreements was fantastic adams charmed the dutch while jefferson and franklin charmed the french the genius of hamilton and madison is balanced with the exceptional political skills of washington i am always amazed when conservatives attack gore vidal since he is an advocate of maximum liberty of the individual and he will viciously criticise fdr with the same venom he would use against george w bush the reader is left with a feeling of wonder and amazement that our principals of government have survived despite the folly of many a generation of politicians vidal would have us recognize that we must remain vigilant and skeptical regarding our nations leadership and direction,270,28
10580,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,i enjoyed vidals writing other people have complained that it felt jumpy and at times he didfrom one time period to another without an explanation it was not until i reached the last few pages that i figured out why he was writing this book at all i kept waiting for some mass summarization of what he was trying to convey with all of these anecdotes it finally came in the last chapter he has trying to delve into what made these people such great men but he does not do it with the usual swift stroke that many authors take when they are trying to glorify historic figures instead he shows that these people were flawed and had their own personalities and agendas and egos but they did some great things and he conveys that through a series of anecdotes overall i enjoyed the book it did not feel like any type of propoganda just a patchwork of stories it gave me insights into those characters of the early history of the republic i would recommend it to anybody who would like a conveniently sized easy-to-read book about the characters in american history,191,29
10581,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i concede that history is written with some bias as to the opinion of the author but historians are or should be purveyors of those opinions not the manufacturers of them historians are not writing history they are in a manner of speaking collecting and reporting on history as it was written i would not recommend this book as a basis for understanding this period of time try benson bobricks angel in the whirlwind or mcculloughs john adams this book is history according to mr vidal his references to modern day events and persons are more an indication of his political leanings than his connection of current events with events of the past you can not understand the present by making moral judgements on historical individuals since they did not have benefit of your understanding of the past conversely they had no understanding of what was to come history is becoming a victim of politics when it should be an accounting of the past skip-it,167,30
10582,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,in this poor excuse for a work of scholarship vidal spends his time and ours entertaining personal assumptions see publishers weekly review viewpoints and pet themes why in the middle of a purported historical work on the founding fathers does he digress into making weak connections with the war in iraq his generalizations of contemporary america and other unrelated obviously biased drivel if i want politically charged opinion on the topics of the day I shall read op / ed pieces or at least something that admits it is bias from the onset if you are looking for an unbiased focused and scholarly substantive work on the topic read ellis founding brothers it won the pulitzer because it is everything inventing a nation is not,120,31
10583,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,this book is all about how smart and witty vidal thinks he is why does not he just build an altar to himslef so we can all worship at his feet enough already with the same lame stuff do not expect any serious insight about the founding fathers he disguises lack of scholarship and historical understanding with dime-store psychology and tabloid journalism,61,32
10584,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,gore vidal has a field day re-examining the political and personal lives of washington adams and jefferson overall a very knowledgeable if sometimes a bit far-fetched portrait of these 3 men their strengths and their foibles vidal writes with a keen awareness of the present as he delves through the past of this great nation almost every line has some sort of resonance with the current disastrous political situation our republic finds itself in and also gives us some clues as to perhaps why we are in the mess we are in despite all the partisan issues some other reviewers may gripe about i found vidals work to be fair and very moderate in tone he calls them as he sees them and if there are jabs at our current presiding government thrown in they are all by virtue of historical truth sometimes as much as you try you can not deny what is staring you in the face,159,33
10585,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,in this vibrant book of historical nonfiction gore vidal illuminates the key figures and events that shaped the founding of the american republic he brings to life washington jefferson adams alexander hamilton and others to create a powerful portrait of americas beginnings by peering at the past we gain a better understanding of the current political climate and inventing a nation is a glorious testament to our founding colored as it is by vidals astute observations and insights,78,34
10586,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,gore vidal in his inventing a nation turns his attention to the first three presidents and the politics of the young united states the in-fighting back-stabbing manipulation and in some cases outright treason as in the case of alexander hamilton between the emerging political parties are discussed in great detail as are the personalities of the founding fathers wih this panoramic background vidal has several points to make that the nation was have today is not at all what the creators of the constitution would have imagined that we americans have surrendered many of the liberties given us by the founding fathers to the courts and corporations and that the democracy we imagine we have has in fact never been so i assume this is intended to provoke thought and reflection by readers which it does but vidal also has an ascerbic side bordering on contempt for the common american when he asserts that most americans have nowhat the electoral college is that the nation has gravely erred by attempting to export democracy beginning with our enterance into wwi and continuing to our current war on terror vidal also bitterly perhaps justly so decries the relequeshing of congressional power to declare war to the executive at the constitutional convention an elderly ben franklin remarked that we have a democracy if we can keep it vidal argues that contrary to the intentions of our founding fathers who also battled similar issues we have been unable to keep it certainly a thought-provoking read but it is sure to anger some,260,35
10587,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,i would recommend the purchase of inventing a nation the main selling point of the book is vidals unbeatable style you already know who the players are court historians have already identified them for you in gross detail two of them adorn mount rushmore gazing at a country that today they might find very strange indeed john adams did not make the cut for mount rushmore i guess you would have to ask gutzon borglum why what the court historians do not generally do is make an effort to cast the founding fathers as human beings remarkable as they were in this book we read about washingtons financial troubles with his mom jeffersons uneasy working relationship with john marshall and adams never-ending correspondence with his wife abigail along with washington adams and jefferson vidal takes time to embellish the margins of his portrait with sub-miniatures of benjamin franklin alexander hamilton john marshall james madison and the ineffable talleyrand if a bland regurgitation of dates times and places are what you are looking for look to a textbook if you are looking for a breath of fresh air and a walk among giants that were only human after all look to vidal,202,36
10588,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,i read this book after having the fun of listening to mr vidal discuss it at an event last month at the new national constitution center in philadelphia I have also taken into account some of the earlier reviews posted here i agree it is not his best work I had save that distinction for lincoln and the united states essays however it is a very thoughtful and funny piece of work vidal intends you to think about what he says there is more to history at least there should be than just getting the dates and names right if you want the life of washington read ds freeman or j t flexner if you want john adams go to david mccullough if you want jefferson see joseph ellis or even dumas malone those are first-rate biographies however what vidal attempts here generally successfully is the second part of history how does what they did reflect now what present events suggest we have not come as far as this founding trio would like see his comments on the relationship of adams alien and sedition acts to the bush patriot act it is funny elegant and enlightening i enjoyed every skewering line,197,37
10589,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,this could have been a great book had gore vidal decided that it was not about him many of his insights are excellent but marred by his acidic references to the current administration there is plenty of great material here without mr vidal deciding that it was not quite flashy enough unless he enriched it with his take on current affairs there is a certain amount of entertainment value here but it is more a sideshow than a main event,78,38
10590,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,vidal is wittier than he is wise more erudite than he is intellectually honest still he is enormously entertaining and provocative for more genuine insight about the characters of the nations founding i prefer the straightforward joseph j ellis founding brothers,41,39
10591,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,gore vidal makes the same erroneous assumption that our countrys beginning somehow magically started with washington adams and jefferson the truth of the matter is that the foundations for the nation were laid in place before any of these three great men came into power as presidents under the constitution although washington adams and jefferson were largely responsible for the implementation of the constitution they were only part of a larger mosaic of leaders who were the true founders of this nation if you want an account of the visionaries and originators of our ideas of government and the leadership that actualized these ideas into being then i suggest that you read my book entitled the first executives lives and events in the shadow of the american revolution,128,40
10592,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,the author had a lot of interesting things to say the wording was not in an easy to read format,20,0
10593,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,it reads like a novel and by a respected vatican reporter if it was by writer that lacked good credentials i would not have believed it i am a disgusted catholic with the church this tells a lot of what is going on and i believe now ratzinger could not handle the scandals the politics and the homosexual activities going on right under his nose it is something offended fallen-away catholics and the believers should read yet it angers me saddens me and nauseates me with what went on it as if everything they taught us is a bunch of lies,100,1
10594,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,this book offers the reader a good insight into the inner workings of the vatican you will get a greater understanding of the power of the curia and the gross mismanagement of church finances,34,2
10595,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,slightly confused writing some elements of the story or stories being repeated as if the original writing was in installments and lots of references for which one needs to know the rome and vatican political environment much better than an average person reading in english language am yet to finish not a gripping read as to the contents so far it includes mostly mutual complaints of vatican figures falling in and out of grace in another industry this would be boring here it amuses me insofar as it shows again that nobody is immune to that,96,3
10596,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,do not expect any source documents do not expect any real proof there are no vatileaks documents to be found here this is just your typical attack on the catholic church i was expecting a lot more like the letters everyone talks about i found nothing this book is like all other attacks there are many options to choose from this book offers nothing in particular,66,4
10597,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,i believe this author is trying to expose the corruption in the roman catholic system if he could simplify some of his specific explanations without losing his focus his writings would be easier to follow,35,5
10598,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,this book meticulously described the way the vatican functions both openly and behind the scene after reading the book i came to realize how human the popes are in spite of their assumed infallibility it became obvious that the last pope resigned due to the unbearable pressure negative from the machinations of the different actors in the affairs of the vatican indeed the pope was afraid as a result of all the deceits and secrecy that abound with those who are supposed to represent jesus christ here on earth i recommend the book to anyone who wants to see the many reasons why the pope gave up nice job gianluigi,110,6
10599,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the author never gave any facts to support his title statement that benedict xvi resigned out of fear however he did manage to paint a sad portrait of the vatican as a real snake pit full of power-lust crawling with servants of satan,43,7
10600,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,i found this book fascinating in the scope of it is revelations about the internal dealings of the vatican and the many many problems it has been dealing with but the translation into english which starts off as acceptable becomes more and more erratic in the second half of the book it was in need of a much closer textual editor to catch myriad errors of usage and expression the text is still basically readable but the reader is aware the english is somewhat substandard,84,8
10601,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,it is a tricky read a thorough knowledge of the curia will help but much of it is inside baseball and keeping track of all the players and where they fit in the org chart is tough i did not get the impression that the pope was afraid but rather he decided that trying to fix the mess was something he was not up to doing,65,9
10602,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,enjoyed the read it only re-confirmed what most rational people already have known this church has a very serious top level management problem,23,10
10603,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the hype about the book is overrated it is really a read for insiders of the church who are not part of the power structure,24,11
10604,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,too long-winded of some interest to see how the vatican runs,11,12

10606,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,nothing to do with ratzinger leave confusing and sensationalist compilation of vatican scandals,13,14
10607,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,book was not good it did not meet it is stated goal of saying why pope benedict resigned let alone afraid much of the text was in the footnotes where a good author would have placed more info in the book the letters at the end were in fine-print italien unreadable on my kindle even if i could read italien i was very disappointed in this slow incoherent book do not buy it,71,15
10608,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,extremely interesting but at times a little scholarly found myself skimming over some parts this book gives some reasonable explanation for the circumstance of his retirement,26,16
10609,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,a very sad peek into a bureaucracy of backbiting control freaks no doubt the holy father had tried to do the right thing i needed to take several showers after reading this book something creepy about it,37,17
10610,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the book did not deliver even the titles expectation,9,18
10611,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,the real best seller has yet to be written that is the one which will link the mafia directly to the vatican and exposed the billions covered up in money laundering the mafia scared ratzinger that is for sure,36,19
10612,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,a good read informative material and up to date kept my attention to find out what was around the next page,20,20
10613,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,i found this book arduous to read keeping track of who everyone was is a feat in itself the scandals it talked about were not that new and frankly i found it boring if the pope stepped down for these reasons then he sounds more like a downtrodden housewife more than a head of state,56,21
10614,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,appendix contains a collection of documents from the vaticanwhose content led in part to pope ratzingers resignation book gives insight into how italian and vatican reporters see the pope the vatican and the catholic hierarchy with greater insider knowledge and without the excessive respect that often clouds american religion reporters,53,22
10615,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,this book is written for any reader who knows the ins-and outs of vatican politics and terrorism but you would have had to know pope benedict xvi as he was as cardinal ratzinger for the 19 years he worked directly under pope john paul ii to see any timid side of him it was there in his spirit but not in his edicts i feel the book has pages and pages of filler in it and will be sold based on it is title only pope benedict xvi took his decision with over a year of deep daily prayer the kind god only gifts to his popes as pope john paul ii told us had benedict done as he had planned he would have gone home to his homeland and moved into his house he and his brother owned with alibrary equal only to the vatican he did not he is secluded in rome so maybe he is doing gods will after all,163,23
10616,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,a fascinating insight into the inner workings of the vatican i found it to be a page-turner who would have thought,22,24
10617,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,this book portrays ratzinger as being a weak man caught up in a web of intriugue run by the vatican that hewas implicit in the continuation of coverof sexual abuse really belies this and his apparent inability to ring changes whilst inn the position of what we are led to believe is the most powerful position in the catholic church certainly tells the world that the catholic church hierarchy has a lot of work to do to reconnect with catholic faith it seems that the vatican can sit and write all sorts of dogma theory and encyclical papers that really are so divorced from the normal catholic practitioner a good read,113,25
10618,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,i worked inside the vatican for 13 years and thought that the information in this much-hyped book would have some insight into the resignation of pope benedict xvi i can say that the author knows little or nothing of the vatican structures and his mistakes are apparent in each section of the book so glaringly wrong such as assigning people to the wrong dicasteries or offices mixing up time lines and making insinuations without careful documentation often the documentation is another journalist or anonymous source as for the english translation it must have been done by a freshman college student just learning italian or worse an italian who never really studied english and did this by computer the errors are so many on each page that it was difficult to read trying to figure out often what the author was really trying to say nuzzi is not a good writer and a worse journalist or chronicler of events he seems to have a few axes to grind as do most italian journalists and he let us his high opinion of himself really interfere with the subject my advice do not bother buying or reading this you come away wit no more information than is already out there,209,26
10619,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,just another work of trash by people who are he shall bent on trashing the catholic church do not waste you money on this,22,27
10620,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,i found the book tedious and poorly edited decent source material but disconnected and no real narrative linkage the translation was not the best and there were numerous typos,29,28
10621,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,i did not enjoy the way the book was written however the material was interesting what ratzinger was afraid of was not very convincing,24,29
10622,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,i expected a better researched book instead it was a bit disjointed a bit of speculation a lot of hearsay not impressed it might have helped if the author had included a time line and even a who has who list of characters in the e nd not a journalistic book,50,30
10623,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,the book was more about intrigue in the vatican than specifically about the pope for the typical reader it was hard to follow and a little dull my opinion,29,31
10624,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,i gave it a 5 star because i am a convert to the catholic church since 1961 and did not know about the curio and the corruption that has been going on to the extent this book explains very interesting and well worth reading,44,32
10625,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,i liked the book however there are a lot of other issues that seem to be missing ratzinger and his secretary george have become a rumored lovers also ratzinger has to live under the protection of the vatican because a lot people wan to sue him about the pedophile issues especially from the legion of christ group there are a number of other issues that should be brought up,69,33
10626,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,it seemed rather confusing and very dry but it did point up what a very human institution the church is,20,34
10627,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,a very interesting read as how the vatican a huge corporate bueracracy was run day to day just like any out of control institution there are the victims and the spoilers he inherited a mess and obviously decided he was to old to fix the mess so passed it on as i understand it he did not want the job to begin with how old do you have to be todown and get some rest i am sure many catholics will read the book and not get it i was born and raised catholic and i got it,98,35
10628,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,after all the curia does this was a sleeper really there is so much going on there this was not worth it,21,36
10629,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,gianluigi nuzzi reminds me of geraldo riveras two-hour-long tv special on opening al capones old vault plenty of hype but little substance this may sell books in italy but in my humble opinion nuzzi should have saved himself the trouble and not translated this book into english,46,37
10630,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,instead of an analysis of the difficulties of the last pontificate i felt it was more gossip and defense i did not find it very insightful,26,38
10631,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,the book overall was very interesting but the translation itself was problematic and at times unclear the text itself was also riddled with grammatical errors which made for very labored reading at times,33,39
10632,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,gianluigi nuzzi makes a deep account some times boring of a few minor affairs occurred within the vatican administrative officers which are common in any human organization mostly produced by envy jealusy and ambition the reader looking for some in depth conspiration that provoked the popes resignation will be dissapointed a realistic analysys of the vatican management weakness would have been apreciated,63,40
10633,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,this book made me feel bad although it may have been the catalyst for the resignation of the pope emeritus so if that was the case then it was a good thing ratzinger reminds me of my mother who was somewhat introverted and and it is very hard to be someone you are not you could see he struggled with the papacy and good grief he was in his mid 80s he has a very cerebral way of dealing with life that is just who he is instead of supporting him the people surrounding pope benedict xvi betrayed him and it is with them the fault lies as a catholic this was a sad but not surprising book to read we have to stop making mere humans into saints and look to god alone,131,41
10634,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the author lost my attention by the second chapter there were too many ifs and uncertainties for a book that is supposedly based on documents smuggled out of the vatican,30,42
10635,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,interesting thought provoking scary read it as soon as it was released the translation was curious in some places with a few english errors did not take anything away from it just wondered who edited it,35,43
10636,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,this was a very juicy book at least the half i read however it needs a better translation to english the first few chapters can be read without much confusion but right after the first 3 chapters the quality of the translation appeared rushed and not very well thought-out unfortunately i could not find the italian version I had love to read it hopefully at some point there will be a better translation or maybe the original will be available as a kindle book magari un giorno ci sar una traduzione migliore ma purtroppo non esiste ancora,96,44
10637,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,it concentrates almost exclusively on vatican infighting and questionable finances if you live in italy and know all these institutions it might interest you as for the vatican intrigues what else is new that the secretary of state was probably involved so what that the ior has to go many people left and right agree the title promises what it does not deliver so the reading is tedious read a summary and save your money,74,45

10671,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,2.0,negative,no ending it is short erotic and could be the beginning of a good story a missing mine filled with gold and whiskey somewhere on her property and he will do anything to get it they were teen lovers but broken apart by feuding families twenty years later he comes back to town and she is still in love with him but after about one chapter it stops and you have to buy the next installment i really hate this kind of book,83,13

10674,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,4.0,positive,good story was really enjoying it when it ended abruptly mid-sentence do not remember it being offered as a sampler wow never got far enough to read anything erotic so i can not review that,33,16
10675,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,3.0,neutral,a good start of the series i am thinking about getting the rest of the story with anticipation for more character development and some really good sex scenes,28,17
10676,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,1.0,negative,this is a goodbut it was not explored the ending is abrupt and without closure probably designed to make you run out and purchase the next book but this was not written well enough for me to do that,41,18
10677,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,1.0,negative,i am so fed up with partial stories I am sure theis to trick you into getting so involved with the story you just have to get the next installment but all it does for me is piss me off and not only will i not get the next installment i will not buy another book from this author also the story was boring,64,19

10679,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,5.0,positive,this is the beginning of a series about the reuniting of two teenage lovers who were separated by a family feud 20 years earlier the only thing is when matt is getting reacquainted with hannah you know he will hurt her again he only wants the right to lease her land to recover a family fortune that rumor has is is buried on her land i have the feeling the other two parts will end up with a less than romantic happily ever after theme,85,21

10709,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,1.0,negative,i like erotic fiction but this was just frustrating there is a story and a plot but i finished this book feeling like i wanted my time back the erotic scenes seemed to be the only thing that mattered it is a chapter in a longer story but it does not have enough of the story for me to waste my time purchasing the rest of it i have a feeling it would become the never ending pit i can not see reading through as much dross as necessary to get to the little gems of story it is a real shame the basic premise seems like it would be good i am tired of authors offering shorts to entice me to buy stories with massive cliffhangers this author appears to be among the worst as the end of the book is full of links to purchase more chapters i am sorry if i wish to dump good money after bad i will do it somewhere other than my reading this author is deleted from my reading list,177,51
10710,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,4.0,positive,it was pretty good the romance was there and it was okay but the man was trying to hard to be a cowboy and that let me down a little but all in all a good read,37,52
10711,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,1.0,negative,i am so tired of these novellas that are not anything but a few chapters of a book without a real ending you have to purchase the next novella to get the next few chapters and so on until the thing finally ends after reading this novella i definitely will not be buying the next chapter predictable story line ridiculous sex scene no romance not worth my time,66,53

10721,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,3.0,neutral,nothing really wrong with this second-chance-but-he has-got-a-secret introduction to a serial but it is not all that interesting this is only the very first part of the story so readers will have to she shall out the bucks to see how it continues,40,63
10722,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,3.0,neutral,i was really getting into the story it was getting pretty hot then it ends and you have to buy the next book and the next and the next and the next and the next just to finish one story what a pitiful way to get more money big authors actually finish a book for one price a sequel is a continuation a of different characters story or years later you do not write a few chapters and call it a book it makes people angry and not want to buy your next series because they will have spent a fortune to read one story,104,64
10723,Kindle_Store,B00C2E18A8,2.0,negative,i love cowboy books but did not like it to slow could not keep my mind on it did not finish the book maybe you will like it better than me,25,65

10728,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,this is a short story not a book i do not like short stories but this is good one of the things i always look for is the number of pages when a book is on kindle as there are so many short stories and even simple essays trying to pass themselves off as books i love to read and getting short pieces annoys me even although good ones like this are rare this trend may hurt book authors so on principle i could give it only three stars,88,3

10734,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,this book seemed to promise a tale of mystery combined with ancient mysticism however the author did not develop that theme it was intriguing and i kept waiting for more then it suddenly ended in a most unsatisfying manner,37,9
10735,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,heres a series i can not wait to get the next installment of you have to read it to really appreciate it,21,10
10736,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,i think the entire book is great it is just that it ends quite abruptly and there is no explanation for the ending or what happened or why,27,11
10737,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,quick read well done but feel like i was looking for a little more overall okay loved the book jacket,20,12

10739,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,1.0,negative,this book is not even worth reading for free the authors wastes all his talents and time with terrible language i suppose to cover up for his inability to have any real good comments to make if that is as deep as an author can go it is time for a new line of work,54,14
10740,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,i thought it ended too suddenly but perhaps that was intended in the end perhaps life is just like that ending too suddenly even when you know the end is coming,31,15
10741,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,this sounded great and the first chapter really had me intrigued but this is a short story not a novel and the end does not resolve anything about the tablet or the identity of two of the three main characters perhaps the author will someday make it into an actual book and fix these problems i suspect it could be a really good book but what has here is mostly just irritating,70,16
10742,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,i wish it would have been longer it had an interesting story but i think the ending left you hanging,20,17
10743,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,1.0,negative,fair story line but not a very suspenseful story sorry to have used my time to read would not recommend to anyone,22,18
10744,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed this author and will look forward to reading more from him my first time reading from an iphone,21,19
10745,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,i had never heard of tom harpe but after reading this i looked up all his books and downloaded them,20,20
10746,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,1.0,negative,the writing is good and i would try another book by this author but this was not for me story developed too quickly,22,21
10747,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,i liked it but it was much shorter than i expected but i guess it is still a good way to pass an hour,23,22
10748,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,i liked it but it was much shorter than i expected it to be so if you want to kill an hour it is a good read,25,23
10749,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,the book was a pleasant distraction for a short time but not a great read i may reread just to kill time,22,24
10750,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,the story was quite good the kind of thing that is completely outside your experience but is written in such a way that it seems real and true it ends abruptly and leaves you to your imagination to bring the fate of the hero to a proper conclusion,48,25
10751,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,i was disappointed only because it was a short story i enjoyed what i read but thought ity would be much better if there were more of it,27,26
10752,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,i liked the story quite a lot sadly it ended just when i was getting hooked on the plot shakes fist curse you tom harper,24,27
10753,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,an unexpected experience reading this book was like driving off a cliff and experiencing an extremely exhilarating rush of disbelief reflection on your past and a dread of the future all in the space of time it took to reach the inevitable conclusion of the choices you have made,48,28
10754,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,1.0,negative,boring and did not keep my attention in the least hate books that do not really thought it was a waste of money,22,29
10755,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,this book left me with questions i could not tell if it is part of a book or a stand alone story an the characters seemed underdeveloped or lacking motive plus you never really find out what the actualdoes,39,30
10756,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,3.0,neutral,the twelfth tablet is a fast paced novelette that took only an hour or so to read i have not checked but there has a good story line here to expand upon,30,31
10757,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,good read downloaded to kindle app on tablet easy read great author everyone should at least give it a try,20,32
10758,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,this book was a compelling short story the only issue that i had was that sometimes the text seemed clunky and some of the action jumped around too quickly for my taste overall a very interesting read,36,33
10759,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,1.0,negative,i would not call this a book more like a chapter not much of a story not much of a plot over all disappointing readone star,25,34
10760,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,1.0,negative,I am am really disappointed is this suppose to be a preview or what i highly recommend you do not waste your time with this read it is a trip not worth the time,32,35
10761,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,i would have given this story five stars but it is such a tease it is well written and flows beautifully i want more,23,36
10762,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,4.0,positive,do not want to reveal anything so I shall just say that it left me wanting more it felt a bit like it ended too soon but it is a good quick read i can not say it was long enough for me to come to care about the characters although i would like to read more by this author,56,37
10763,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,the story starts interesting and holds you until the end the work flows or rather rushes toward the climax would like to read more from this author,27,38
10764,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,5.0,positive,i give this book a 5 star rating because it had me glued to my tablet from the first chapter when i finish you will get another review thank you tom harper for being able to deliver such a wonderful story you have a new fan,46,39
10765,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,this seems to be a short story / novella ebook exclusive from established author tom harper but i do not know why there has been no marketing for it perhaps the publisher are doing an experiment it is about a british student named paul specializing in ancient greek religion and working part time at the zurich museum who encounters a pair of unusual art collectors ari and valerie after closing hours at the museum they bribe him into convincing the private owner of one of the twelve orphic tablets that the museum needs to photograph the artifact a plausible request since the museum had previously done some work on the tablet but of course ari and valerie have ulterior motives and there is a nagging feeling that they were already familiar with pauls educational and working background and deliberately targeted him unfortunately it was very lacking and left me with far too many questions i still do not understand what aphrodite has to do with the orphic tablets harper is an excellent author and I have enjoyed his full length novels but i do not think short stories suit his style,185,40
10766,Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,I am not sure what i was expecting when i downloaded this one something better in any case maybe had it been presented in longer form and fleshed out into a proper novel it would have worked better as it is it was neither short story nor proper novella in my opinion,50,41
10881,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,3.0,neutral,la verdad el prembulo se me hizo sumamente aburrido no hay nada de romntico en ello as que no es de mis favoritas,23,0
10882,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,5.0,positive,me encanto pero se me hizo muy corto es una historia muy interesante sobre todo porque es en pars te invito a leerla,24,1
10883,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,2.0,negative,me parece que le falta mas fuerza a la historia de cada personaje no me gusta como termino me parecieron muy pobres las historias de cada personaje,27,2
10884,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,2.0,negative,acabo de leer el primer volumen me gusto algo pero pienso que los tres volumenes podian estar en uno solo eso es aprovecharse de los lectores si convierten los dos volumenes restantes en uno solo los comprare de lo contrario leere otros libros,43,3
10885,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,1.0,negative,es un libro que dividieron en tres partes para sacar mas dinero y hacerse la importante la autora es una hisyoria lenta aburrida y que no logra emocionarte la protagonista es descrita como una muchacha muy x y que no puede competir contra las mujeres guapisimas que vivistan al protagonista el protagonista descrito como un cuero de hombre es tan vaga su descripcion que aun no logro darle cara a ese cuerpo espectacular que decriben la forma en como los protagonistas se conocen es simple y tonta al mismo tiempo y ese primer beso te deja en queeeee a que hora y por ultimo la unica escena sexual esta tan mal escrita que por un momento piensas que el esta detras de ella y luego delante y al final siempre estuvo detras de ella en conclusion la autora me sale debiendo 299 y la estrella que le di,148,4
10886,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,2.0,negative,este trabajo definitivamente tiene posibilidades pero la estrategia de cortar una sola historia en 3 solamente para aumentar las ganancias no me parece correcto debera especificarse,26,5
10887,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,2.0,negative,como pretenden describir unas cuantas paginas como lo mejor despues de 50 sombras son solo unas cuantas paginas que dividieron en tres libros aparece paginado como si fueran cientos de paginas y no es tal cuando menos piensas tienes que comprar el segundo libro,44,6
10888,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,3.0,neutral,ha empezado bien algo alocada pero bien la redaccion no esta del todo bien escrita hay algunas palabras que al leerlas no tienen sentido la persona que hizo la traduccion debe de ser mas cuidadosa al traducir del idioma original de la novela,43,7
10889,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,4.0,positive,buena pero de un estilo bastante repetido tipo trilogas como 50 sombras crossfire pdeme lo que quieras lo malo muy corto cada volumen no supera las 30 hojas el costo total de todos los volumenes se hace alto,38,8
10890,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,3.0,neutral,a diferent story and in different places with big expectation situations you will never expect can be possible in this times,22,9
10891,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,1.0,negative,a cheap copy of other supposedly erotic books i would never recommend this book or this writer to anybody in my family or to any of my friends,28,10

10893,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,2.0,negative,no parece un volumen parece un capitulo de una novela te la regalan para que despues tengas que comprar las demas todas juntas podrian hacer una novela,27,12
10894,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,3.0,neutral,excelente escritora pero no me gusta su manera de comercializar porque dividir historias en 10 entregas es como mucho pero bueno hay de todo y sigo opinando que es excelente la manera como escribe a autora y como te lleva a ese lugar mgico llamado fantasas erticas,47,13
10895,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,4.0,positive,this book is too short especially for the money you pay it just gets started and then it is over i did not want to get the viol 2 because the value is not worth it,33,14
10896,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,5.0,positive,este libro lo escog porque mela atencin el ttulo me mantuvo siempre motivada me gust desde el principio hasta el final,23,15
10897,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,5.0,positive,muy bueno excelente facil lectura me gusto mucho esta super bueno excelente bueno perfecto buenisimo me gusto mucho esta bueno,20,16
10898,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,4.0,positive,te deja interesado a tal grado que quieres obtener las siguientes partes pues necesitas saber en que continua la historia,20,17
10899,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,1.0,negative,no me gusto la encontr sin mucho sentido solo lo sexual pero si hubiera sido complementado con algo mas profundo seria mucho mejor,23,18
10900,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,1.0,negative,no me gusto nada la novela la le toda solo por que y la haba empezado pero sin chiste muy predecible x,22,19
10901,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,2.0,negative,is too short needs more chapter is not wort to pay for that to little pages needs mosre ideas it sucks,21,20

10903,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,3.0,neutral,historia corta y rpida donde todo es muy predecible el final deja bastante que desear lo le en pocas horas pero falt ms historia,23,22
10904,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,1.0,negative,no contiene los elementos para quedarse con ganas de seguir leyendo considero que se debera realizar esta triloga en un solo tomo,22,23
10905,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,1.0,negative,un libro muy cort para llamarse un volumen algo como una introducci n para que los lectores compren los siguientes vol menes lo que no har hay que esperar las ltimas p ginas para leer unas l neas er ticas de lo m s aburridas,40,24
10906,Kindle_Store,B00CA4MIP4,3.0,neutral,good book to read on my kindle my daughter likes it a lot i just began to read it thank you,21,25
