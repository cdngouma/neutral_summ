393,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding the pins looked very cute i wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette and i gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well the pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding great product for a good price,66,3
394,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold overall it looked great and is reusable,26,4
395,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,I am actually pretty happy with these they are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I am not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy but overall it is not a huge issue they still look so pretty i used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well i plan to use them for my wedding now as well i do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well but i could not find them anywhere,89,5

398,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,these hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day during my trial my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle i bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair we decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive these hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost i definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day,103,8
399,All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,the metal had a cheap look to it did not end up wearing it,13,9

557,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,that i received was not listed but i still like it it took a long while to arrive but it was still cute when i received it there has a wire going through the cloth so you can manipulate it all you like and it stays on fairly well however beware that when the wire breaks you basically have to throw it out or remove the wire,66,1

562,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,you are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be alisted not worth the money,21,6
563,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,it is a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it is supposed to be,36,7
564,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2.0,negative,i got some ugly funkyand while it looks cute on me it is really small i have a rather big head and so it does not reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model it is also made of cheap wire so be careful with it,53,8
565,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,I am very disappoined i ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material what am i going to do with three of the exact same headband,27,9

574,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,all I shall say about this is i believe it is meant for kids not adults,15,18
575,All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,really thought these were coming as a set was really disappointed to receive 1 single head band,17,19
576,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the maroonis nice and the blue is not bad but i will not use the other two now that i know that the magnet does not work i was really sad to figure out it did not work but it still was not a bad price for the maroon and blue and they look okay without the magnet feature,56,0
577,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i love theand everything but when i opened it half of it was spilled everywhere and i could only use the red and silver extremely disappointed i love the other colors and it wears nicely but i just really do not like the fact half of my order was unusable,51,1
578,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,i love the colors but the magnet did not work at all good thing i had ordered another magnet to go with these i tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked,39,2
579,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,problem was not with the polish itself it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all i tried everything so i am disappointed,27,3
580,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,i recieved the package and they looked fine i did not open the individualboxes when i recieved it since it was a gift for my niece when she opened them the next day one of the bolttle was broken from the top andwas leaking out and starting to dry already the others worked great i just wish that the other one was not broken,67,4
581,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,i do not recommend it it is clumpy and hard to put on cleanly,12,5
582,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,love this magnetic polish i have worn the silver / gray magnetic for just a day and already receiving complements on the shimmer,21,6
583,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,this product is terrible i tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work the polish is clumpy like it has sand in it or something so it can not be used as regular polish either i tested the gold and the blue very very disappointed i would have asked for a refund but i bought them awhile ago and am just now trying them,67,7
584,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,the brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
585,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i got a 3d magnet gel polish i tried them on my nails i work at nails salon and i know how to use that the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality seem they had sands inside and can not work at all especially the silver and gold one i will never buy it anymore bad and bad,63,9
586,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,looks great and simple to apply just hold the magnet for longer then the 10 seconds it recommends roughly 30 seconds and it works nice,25,10
587,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i was so excited for these polishes to arrive today unfortunately two of the four colors are unusable they were mostly dried into a big clump i even tried using gel thinner the other two colors worked great and the magnet worked perfectly on them,45,11
588,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,i love this polish it is beautiful and exactly as described the shipping as fast and the seller is super nice,20,12
589,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,beautiful colors do not think the magnetic thing woks well but the colors make up for it,15,13
590,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,beautiful colors the cat eye does not seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me I shall practice more update after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4 i kept them in the original box all the time so it was not light that was cutting them,59,14
591,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i purchased came quickly two of the products look as if they had been previously opened the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out i give 2 stars one for each good product the blue and silver,40,15
592,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,i bought these solely for the star shaped magnet i found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish I am going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if i can get the desired results still holding out hope on that i can not give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is it is lose runny and it pulls away from the nail horribly by the time i was done applying it the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that i eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing and i still had bare spots the formula is subpar the only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately which would end up being more time consuming i do not recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure so on top of the bare spots i can not even see the start mark i can not wait to scrape this off my nails,180,16
593,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,initially i ordered this product and received a duplicate colour ie blue red and two silvers instead of gold and silver however customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end i received all four colours i have used the blue red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark slate colour i have not tried the gold yet but generally i like the sensationail brand a lot,88,17
594,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this stuff is awesome the colors are very pretty and the magnetic stuff works great even comes with the little magnet wand,22,18
595,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i can not figure out how to get the magnets to work right they seem to barely work which just makes the polish look sloppy,24,19
596,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,the colors are pretty was not sure i would like the dark colors but after trying the blue i discovered they are pretty have to master the magnet although did not get it centered the first time,37,20
597,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,it took me a while to get the hang of it but this polish is quite awesome i got so many compliments on the starburst people were in awe and wondered how i did it,35,21
598,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,these were awful i love sensational products and normally they will last a week these only lasted a day or two before peeling off and the design looks nothing like what has on the package,34,22
599,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,birthday present for daughter she loved the set,8,23
600,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,there were horrible we have used other polishes by this brand and loved them but these magnetic polishes are dried out and clumpy seller would not comment back on returns such a waste as I have seen these in videos and they look like they would work great,45,24
601,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,i opened the package of the blue which was completely sealed took out the brush and it was all wonky and clotted i cleaned off the mess and it was bubbly and lumpy and the brush resembled toothbrush bristles it was impossible to get a nice semi-even coat of polish with this brush then i tried the magnet thinking well at least i get a nice magnet from each of these nope did not work the gold also was clotted and wonky but not as much and the brush stiff like a toothbrush but the magnet worked on that one still not a nice bold star pattern like on the box but more like thin straight lines i do not want to open the other 2 right now because these are very smelly and I am sensitive to that i purchased these a while ago so it is past my return window or these would definitely be going back the colors were great although,160,25
602,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,do not buy i use this brand of nail polish all the time and these are very inferior compared to the norm they were clumpy goopy and completely unusable when i went to request a return it said these items not eligible for a return either old or used but either way do not waste your money,58,26
603,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,terrible one bottle came with the brush bent completely up unusable another bottle came with hardly any polish in it at all my daughter was very disappointed the other 2 bottles were fine and the magnet does work,38,27
604,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,this was part of a gift and she loved it,10,28
605,All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,horrible this stuff was crap the magnetic properties were a joke if i could rate it a 0 i would 2 out of the 4 bottles were a dried out mess of goo beauty brags said that they would send me 2 new bottles or reimburse i got nothing from them do not purchase this junk,53,29
630,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,what a piece of crap this is i have 2 6 mon old kittens one sniffed it and walk away and has never returned to it the other nicky tried to scracth it and it just swung around and smacked her in the face to wit she bit it and walked away made very poorly and cheapjust a piece of crappy rug glued to a piece of cardboard i should have gone where i always do [ ] or even walmart,78,0
631,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,the carpet on this is really short and the strip overall is too narrow i tried hanging it on several doorknobs and even anchoring it on the floor to no avail,31,1
632,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,it is somewhat pricey considering shipment anyway my can does not use it as intended she likes it when flat on the floor,23,2
633,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i tried it in several locations on the floor on the door and in their faces i rubbed it with catnip and tried to charm them with treats and they still looked at me like i was smoking crack what exactly do want us to do with that thing mom my girls will play with pretty much anything except this thing i went over to petco about week later and bought a super-cheapie carpet-covered 2 stand clawing post with a feather toy and the girls said now that is what we are talkin bout mom in my opinion do not waste your money,100,3
634,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cat loves her scratching pad and it was the best 5 I have ever invested chooch is not much of a scratcher she does like the side of my bed and the antique chenille sofa in my living room but she has a stretch scratcher and this scratching pad is right up her ally she would not touch it when it was hanging from a doorknob but she has very happy with it on the floor after she scratches on it she loves to sit on it as if to keep anybody else in the house from claiming it,97,4
635,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,are you kidding me cats will definitely use this thing to scratch their claws on so get one and save your sofa if only for a little while,27,5
636,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,cats pulled the looped rope off pretty fast ended up mounting it to door way they always clawed on still claw at it but not damaging my door frame now,30,6
637,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,both of my cats love this scratcher i believe they are both drawn to the scent that is infused in the scratcher i hung it on my bed post where they both like to scratch now they scratch the scratcher instead of my bed great product very inexpensive as well,50,7
638,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,for what ever reason my cats refuse to use this a carpet sample on a stiff plastic backing is all this is,22,8
639,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i knew it would be small and cheap but it is literally something you can buy at my local dollar store it is a bit thicker than cardstock with felting on it it hangs on the door knob but because it is so light the cat can not gain purchase on it to scratch it it is essentially like my cat trying to scratch a hotel do not disturb sign total waste of 750 pay double and buy something substantial this is total cheap crap,84,9
640,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,thisis exactly as described and fits well over a door handle however my cat shows zero interest in it even when i put it on the floor for easy access,33,10
641,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,disappointing cats are not interested at all sort of flimsy,10,11
642,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,greatjust can not get the cat to think so,10,12
643,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,i purchased 5 of these and hung them around on the doors where my cats tended to scratch my cats push them aside and scratch on the door anyway,29,13
644,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,smaller then i expected but the cats are happy so far i will update as to how long it actually lasts in the future,24,14
645,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,my cat definitely do not like this one they prefer the ones where i can add the catnip this one is cheap but the cats will ignore it i use it on the floor in front of the litter box now,40,15
646,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,not really satisfied my cat does not like it does not seem too much like a scratch pad not long enough when hanging on door but fair price thank you,28,16
647,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,great product cats seem to prefer it on the floor rather than hanging from the door although,17,17
648,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats seriously are obsessed with this they always dig i have two unclawed cats at it and my third with claws with flip it all over and roll on it and claw into it too I am thinking about buying another one as they really just love it that much,50,18
649,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i hung it up and my cats ignored it i put it on the floor and they liked it,19,19
650,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,my cats do not even use this i sprayed some catnip mist to try to get them interested and they just go lick it and walk away maybe it is just my cats i do not know but i feel i wasted my money,42,20
651,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,i placed this directly next to the couch that the cats like to scratch most of the time they are willing to attack this instead it is not intensive scratch therapy but it is only 2 and not nearly as messy as cardboard scratch pads in the same general price range i have one on a doorknob and another one just lying on the floor two of the cats prefer the one on the floor the other one enjoys reaching up to attack the one on the door it has been six months now and the scratch pads are both still in perfect condition despite being used regularly you would never know that they are used this is the perfectif 1 your cats scratch your couch and 2 you have 33 in your cart and need a 2for free shipping,142,21
652,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats love this they finally stopped scratching my wall,10,22
653,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,wanted to break the habit of cats scratching at the door frame i hung these off of a couple of doorknobs lo and behold my cats ignore these tried rubbing catnip on the pads no luck good thing they are cheap,40,23
654,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,brought for my boyfriend cat have not gotten a chance to hang it looks like a good buy I shall let you know when they visit,24,24
655,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,this is very thin and my cat hardly pays any attention to it but it does look nice hanging on my door I am going to spray catnip on it hopefully she will use it more great for the price especially as an add on,43,25
656,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,protect your doors our cat was shredding the weatherstripping on the front door in her attempt to get our notice to let her in now she scratches on this pad and it makes enough noise that we know she is out there and can let her in it has prevented further damage i highly recommend it as it is flat and we can swing it to the side to close the door solved our problem,75,26
657,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,huh the cats completely ignore it maybe they should make scratching pads out of nice leather as that seems to be much preferred in my house to these cheapo pads oh well at least those little beasties have not discovered the woodwork and i wanted a new sofa anyway,48,27
658,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,cats have not used this even although i have multiple hanging at different locations and different heights throughout my house they would much rather use other scratchers i have,26,28
659,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,cats had no interest in it whatsoever i even tried spraying it with catnip spray very cheaply made but that is why the price was so cheap i can not hold that against them it may work for someone else but our cats were way more interested in the actual carpet and never looked twice at this scratch pad back to the drawing board,64,29
660,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,this was the most stupid cat scatcher made,8,30
661,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i should have known that hanging something lightweight would because it to swing around on the door handle when the cat tries to use it so i attached it to the carpet using velco she likes it and uses it now,41,31
662,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,for 250 what do you expect it is not the best scratch pad i ever saw but it can go anywhere hang it lay it down attach it to another surface and it does not make a mess like cardboard scratch pads it is obviously made from the scraps left over from indoor-outdoor carpeting but like i said it is well worth the money paid the only thing is some kitties might not prefer the carpet suface but that my friends is something you have to find out yourself overall aok,85,32
663,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,my cats ignored it hanging on the door and i think it was too short for them to get too once i put it on the floor they use it now,31,33
664,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,our cat quail was not interested in this i should not have bought it when i could have just attached a cord to a free carpet sample i do not hate it maybe other cats would like this style and it is very inexpensive i just do not like it because it did not work out for us,54,34
665,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,my cats are happy to scratching on door knob i mean hanging on the door knob lols,17,35
666,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,4.0,positive,there has not much to it but it works fine,9,36
667,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,this may be the only scratcher my cats have never touched i do not know what has wrong I have got another door-hanger scratch pad and they love that one it might be my cats although and not the scratch pad,38,37
668,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,nice scratcher for kitties who enjoy vertical surfaces for claw maintenance our new addition finally decided he liked the horizontal cardboard better which rendered this one superfluous wow do you know how long I have been waiting to call something superfluous,40,38
669,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,i used this on a door to the third floor in the home that i never leave open but the cats will let me know also when they want to go up there by scratching and i had taught them to touch the door knob when they want up there sounds crazy,52,39
670,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my cat went to right to the scratch pad just as soon as i hung it up she tried to use it an her paw nails got stuck in the carpet material she has tried it a few times and can not use it i turned it over to the back side and she will kind of use that overall pretty disappointed,61,40
671,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,pros inexpensive unobtrusive cons basically carpet on cardboard flimsy cat does not like it if you cat is obsessed with carpet then i guess this product is for you if you cat is into scratching the furniture thiswill not distract him for that i sprayed tons of catnip on it and my cat looks at me like i am nuts and on drugs spend more money and get a better cat scratch pad,75,41
672,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,well my cat loves to scratch things but this was definitely a waste of money he has never touched it sucks,20,42
673,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,my two cats do not uses it good price but it did not work oft my kitties maybe it will work for yours i got 2and that was a mistake,29,43
674,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,our kitten played with it a bit but only a little bit it is too flexible to be used as a scratcher,22,44
675,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,1.0,negative,does not attract cats at all thankfully it was inexpensive because our cats have not gone anywhere near this thing since we have bought it,24,45
676,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,2.0,negative,i have 2 hanging sisal cat scratchers and a cat tree with sisal legs that the cats use constantly i have never seen my cats touch the omega paw scratcher and the scratchers still look new,36,46
677,Pet_Supplies,B0009YSCMU,5.0,positive,since i bought this product my cat no longer claws my furniture if you have a cat or cats i highly recommend this product,24,47
678,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,this backseat barrier kept my dogs from coming up front for about one hour until they figured out that they could just easily jump right over the top of it this might work for a very little dog or a car with an extremely low ceiling or a dog that does not have much desire to make it is way into the front seat but I am not sure why you would need this in the first place if your dog was not constantly trying to jump into the front while you are driving i thought this was going to be the answer to all of my dog transporting problems but it is just a waste of money,114,0
679,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,while the main portion of the barrier is well made it is too short and flimsy to keep my border collies and golden retreiver from jumping on top and over it the upper netting will not stay in an upright position partially because the two stabilizer bars holding it up broke the stitching holding them in place so they are now useless get the outward hound version for less than ten bucks and save some money,74,1
680,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we bought this product because our dog kept jumping into the front seat the product is a little flimsy and she can still jump over it but it is helping us train her to stay in the back it also keeps her safely contained when we have to slam on the breaks overall it is a good product but possibly a little over priced,64,2
681,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,this is a durable product that even works for big doges it is somewhat complicated to install and the top round wood rod keeps coming out so i removed it the barrier still works fine 100 effective but a little difficult,42,3
682,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,worked great for my 2014 toyota corolla i had to be creative on how i hooked up the bottom strap but it worked great kept the dogs in the back seat safe and sound,34,4
683,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i have purchased kurgo products before the quality is nice it keeps the dogs in the back seat but they can still see what is going on in the front seat,31,5
684,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this kurgo does not work with all vehicles,8,6
685,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my two goldens jumped this in a heartbeat back to drawing board this actually hindered getting them back into the back seat as they did not have as much enthusiasm going back to their seat,34,7
686,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,it was okay did not love how it fit in my car could not seem to get it secure enough now matter how much i tightened the straps,26,8
687,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this is very difficult to get attached to the seats it is flimsy so the dogs just went around it with some serious rigging you could probably get this to work or if your dogs are not very adament about sitting on your lap essentially you get what you pay for,49,9
688,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,a little complicated to get set up but i installed along with the seat cover and dog bridge works great to keep dogs in the back seat which is critical since we foster rescues,35,10
689,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,worst thing every the dogs can just pull it down and run over it,14,11
690,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,52 lb springer spaniel plowed over it guess he really wants to ride shotgun he also did not like looking thru the mesh one we tightened his back seat harness and he could see out the front window clearly he was a happier dog concept is terrific but not for us,51,12
691,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my dog had already put a hole in the mesh part of it ther than that it is a great investment if it were taller it would be better,29,13
692,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,lasted about 20 minutes then my dog chewed through the side straps and was back in the front seat,19,14
693,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,keeps my dogs in the back where they belong,9,15
694,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is fantastic being that i am 71 years old it took a little while to put it on but i am so happy with it now my dogs will be safe and i can quit worrying about them when i take them places well worth the money thank you,50,16
695,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,excellent stops our dogs from coming to visit us by standing on the armrest yet does not stop them seeing out the front window space to keep a water bowl and ball without them rolling around in the back,38,17
696,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,my very athletic dog has managed to get around the barrier so not all that useful,16,18
697,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,for small or medium size vehicles bought for our 2016 ram mega cab and does not fit received product quickly but did not try to install until planning our next trip with our pets needless to say it was a few days after the return period expired reading the reviews and description sounded like it would fit wrong also noted that once installed and tight it prohibits the passenger from putting the seat back in case they want to sleep or rest would not recommend for large trucks if installed elastic bungee chords might help lowering the backrest,96,19
698,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,unfortunately this did not work with our very spoiled labs,10,20
699,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,not a perfect match for my car volvo but has enough straps and connectors that i was able to make it work anyway seems sturdy definitely deters my dog from clambering up front while I am driving,36,21
700,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,strap tore pretty quickly i am going to look into alternative options,12,22
701,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this is the second type of backseat barrier that i have purchased and the only that i would recommend the construction is very sturdy particularly if you insert the optional metal bar and should hold back most dogs,38,23
702,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,quality made product my dog climbed over it in less than 5min,12,24
703,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,the rod that goes across the top for stability is too short could not get it together and,17,25

705,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,put this in my suburu outback it did fit nice but it did not hold up at all to the dogs hanging on it easily jumped over and they chewed thru the bottom connection cords it was money thrown out the window took about 10 minutes for my 25 lb cocker spaniel to destroy it,55,27
706,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,not for everyone but it works for me i have 10 dogs most are trained to stay in the back two will get in the back and immediately run through to the front this prevents them from doing that could they jump over could they destroy it yes to both but my dogs just are not motivated to do that this is doing exactly what i needed it to do it all depends onl your dogs,75,28
707,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this was made nicely but it did not fit my car very well also i wasted a lot of time because there had been a design change that was not reflected in the instructions in the box or on the web,41,29
708,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this was a christmas gift to my husband and he is very pleased with it,15,30
709,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,a big help keeping our labradoodle out of the front seat on long trips,14,31
710,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,worked in our 2014 toyota highlander to keep our boxer in the back and separate from the kids she only tried to get over once when we stopped but was not able to get over all the way great price and good value for what we needed it for,48,32
711,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,difficult to install not all of the items described in the instructions are actually on the unit that said once it is installed it is the only device i have found that keeps my 80 lb dog off my lap while i am driving,44,33
712,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,easy to install after a while we did not need it anymore,11,34
713,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,yes my dog can jump over the top no i do not let him but for the price this can save a never ending car struggle if you are working to train you dog to stay in the back seat,40,35
714,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,excellent mother is so glad keeping her dog in the backseat,11,36
715,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,the only way to secure it up higher in an suv or any car is to remove the headrest to get the barrier to secure the straps do not have a buckle to remove and snap in to head rest my head rests are not designed to be removed therefore the barrier can not sit high up my dogs are still jumping over the barrier and sitting up front very disapointed,69,37
716,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,even tho it says it is for our car the dogs who are small medium size goes right over the top of it does not work at all,24,38
717,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,do not waste your money it is flimsy and loose not to mention bulky all the straps and buckles are a pain as well,22,39
718,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,i always have my dogs with me in the car and am very pleased with this barrier it is super easy to install unlike other barriers i have used in the past and because of it is fabric design it is silent I have had the more elaborate barrier that had bars but that one tended to always come loose and then would rub on the seat or jiggle noisily none of my dogs have jumped over the barrier and they seem content with the see-through design at the top so they can look out the front window i do have a golden retriever german shepherd and a springer spaniel the barrier may not deter a dog that is determined to ride shotgun however we also foster dogs and i bring the fosters along to the dog park the two foster dogs that we have had since i purchased the kurgo did not attempt to jump over it either,157,40
719,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we really love this pet barrier we have had several others in the past and this is by far the best the last one was metal and looked like a cage or the back of a police car it was hard to install and take out and would not stay in place we just returned from a trip from florida to virginia and back and the kurgo worked perfectly it is easy to install and fits up against the seat so you do not loss any floor space as we did with several other barriers the price is less then any other we have bought and is really worth the it the kurgo arrived even earlier then we were expecting overall you will love it and you we highly recommend it,131,41
720,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,while it does the trick it is a little too high it blocks my vision a bit when i am backing up well made however and worth it,28,42
721,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,I am sure it would have been fine if it were complete i did not even get a receipt invoice in the box very surprising had to go out and purchase a bar barrier at the last minute,35,43
722,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we definitely need this pet barrier our dogs jump back and forth all the time this seemed to help but only 3 days after installation one of the dogs tunneled through and broke a strap straps need to be stronger otherwise it is a good investment,46,44
723,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,works well however very difficult to install the directions are not very clear it should install in a few minutes however because of the lack of direction it takes awhile,30,45
724,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this does not work in our suv it does not stay up in the postion needed to keep our big dog in the back it does keep groceries from rolling forward,31,46
725,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,if you have 1/2 a brain you can install without directions contains up to 3 dogs in the car at least that is how many are in this family good quality does the job as detailed very satisfied,37,47
726,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this pet barrier will make my dog safer as we travel it was easy to install and is very sturdy,20,48
727,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,buyer beware the pictures shown are not what you get you do get a kurgo backseat barrier but it is the one on their website i have yet to install it so i do not know if it works for me yet,41,49
728,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i bought this because it said it could seprate the back seat well it does not i went to kurgo actual site and they do not claim to have a model like that complete waste of my time installing and money i reccomend doing more research before purchaseing this,48,50
729,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,we needed something to contain our new 1yr 8mo old 67 lb rescue puppy i searched the web to find something reasonably priced that would fit in our lincoln navigator our car has the 7 seat option and we often use them all i found it easy to install and high enough to keep our big boy in the back we also ordered the solvit 62316 waterproof suv cargo liner could not be happier with prime shipping,75,51
730,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,we have a golden retriever / aussie shepherd mix she is just about ocd about going back and forth from the front to the back seats when driving our murano suvs the kurgo has been installed pretty easily and does a good job of keeping her in the back while the car is in motion if i park and leave her in the car in appropriate weather she will get to the front seat by squeezing between the doorpost and the front drivers seat no problem the only thing i wish was different is that there was more of the see-through mesh instead of the black nylon canvas blocking hers and our view between the seats,114,52
731,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the barrier gets the job done for our 9 month old golden retriever it keeps her in the back seat and much less of a distraction while driving both traveling and local driving has become much more enjoyable for all of us we can still see her and give her a pat now and then she loves to ride with her chin resting on the top of the barrier however according to my husband it is not very easy to install and remove and takes some time so ours remains in my car all the time which I am not very excited about,102,53
732,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,my dog jumped right over the top we have a very active shelty did not use till we went on a trip too late to return,25,54
733,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,let me add my voice to those who say that these things are worthless it took my three month old puppy less time to run over this barrier than it took me to install it what a ripoff,38,55
734,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i first tried this product on our pickup however the seats were too high and the barrier did not stop our dog for a second then i installed it in our suv and it is working well it is a little confusing to install but taking the directionsbyworked ok and it took me about 45 minutes all in all i think it is a good product and does help keep the dog in the back seat,79,56
735,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,i had a hard time getting this to stay in place my dog jumped right over it it may have worked better on a vehicle with larger seats,28,57
736,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i did not like it the instructions were confusing and there were way too many pieces that looked alike,19,58
737,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,subaru forrester with sunroof when the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down they like to take turns leaning on the center console and would slide forward when stopping she sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the giant and he tries to escape to the front not good nor safe the metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof they would hit the glass of sunroof those seem to be semi-permanent whether that is because take up to much room to store or to hard to install and remove i do not know all do not buy decision makers for me when i discovered kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs it does easy to install and remove even folds and slides back into storage bag easily dogs were happy they could still look over headrests and we are all riding safer we are happy and have already recommended to someone in the parking lot,162,59
738,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,this product is not only difficult to install it also does not work my lab jumped over it with no problem it just makes it harder to get him back in the back seat,33,60
739,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,2.0,negative,we take our terrier everywhere in our grand cherokee when we leave him in the car to job or eat he hops in the front seat he is a major shedder and likes to leave imprints on the car windows with his nose this device was difficult to attach it took a number of tries to find a way to fasten the lower parts biggest problem however was the ease with which our dog found ways to go through the barrier when we left him in the car it worked well to prevent him from climbing onto the center console while we were driving,104,61
740,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i received the backseat pet barrier and could not figure out how to install it finally figured it out and it works pretty good on the expensive side but nice product,31,62
741,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,5.0,positive,this pet barrier works great for our dogs they do not even try to come through it fit perfect in my dodge calliber our dogs are not small one is 110 lbs and the other is 80 lbs i think for the price it works great,45,63
742,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,1.0,negative,i put this behind the front seats in my xtended cab pickup truck my standard poodle just climbed right over it since then the material is tearing where the metal stays are poking through might work for a small dog but not mine,43,64
743,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,the kurgo backseat pet barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound very enthusiastic portuguese water dog out of the front seat this was critical to me because my car a saab has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as i was driving a rather unnerving experience as soon as she saw the barrier my dog did not even try to wiggle through it sent a clear message and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet the barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat while simultaneously barring access to the front seat one caveat the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror so I am planning to remove it it unfastens easily this product is a great value and will probably last a very long time owing to it is sturdy construction and strong materials I have owned it for about a month and could not be happier,182,65
744,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,my girlfriend was able to install it in no time and it works great although her dog does not like it,20,66
745,Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,i have a 100 lb lab mix who likes to play co-pilot while i drive and cuddle he likes standing between my seats which is dangerous for me and him and we have bumped heads too many times so I have been shopping for a barrier i have a 4 door sedan and therefore i can not install one of those big metal barriers which are very unattractive my only complaint is the installation it was a pain and difficult to understand and I am not sure if it is installed correctly instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat other then that it is not as tall as i had expected / hoped my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive but at least he has contained to the back seat,145,67
1081,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van after working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off theof my table while drying a dog i decided a change was in order i have a metalon the perimeter of my grooming table i drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on theand through the table i removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4 - 20 bolt i mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside i now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table,119,0
1082,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,these work great holding not only the hose end of my high-powered dryer for the corgis but can also support the weight of a hand-held dryer for our papillon the clamps are very stiff and if you have any problems with lack of hand strength this product will be a challenge to use,53,1
1083,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,the clamp is strong i need 2 hands to clamp it down the black little plastic covers at the clamp tips slide off easy i suppose one could glue them back into place with some glue-epoxy just have not gone through the trouble of doing that yet for at home use it works fine anything fancier and you are in the professional grooming business i suppose like an extendable flex arm which rotates on / from your ceiling around the dog d have not used it but a few times,86,2
1084,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,I have used thisonce and so far I am loving it my american cocker puppy squirms a bit when she has on the grooming table after getting her bath the groomers third arm allows me to keep both hands on her while still being able to dry her off cuts my time in half very sturdy well made product,58,3
1085,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does my only minor complaints might be that for a woman the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality you should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps will not completely protect theof the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table i would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on overall a good quality product,110,4
1086,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this was very much needed with my comando hi velocity dog dryer it frees both my hands when i drying my dog and doing hair stretching and fluffing great help now the photo in the ad is silver but the one i got was black coated i believe that for it is protection but it works good,56,5
1087,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i actually returned this grooming arm it was not strong enough to hold the hose,14,6
1088,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open clamp does not really work well too heavy,11,7
1089,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,love this for my hand held hair dryer much better than holding under my chin for fluff drying,18,8
1090,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,very sturdy but the plastic covers on the clamps are cheap thin and fall off easily when the clamps are opened i have secured mine with electrical tape,28,9
1091,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i work as a dog bather and do a lot of force drying some of my larger project dogs have been difficult to dry taking about a half hour with a reducer cone and two motors going it was a lot of hair i bought this to stretch dry some of my hairier clients to really fluff them up for a groom the first day i attached it to my table it got used on a matted doodle and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat the doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker so did that golden it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile if you are thinking of buying a stretch dryer or a big stand dryer try this first i was ready to spend 200 on a stand dryer when this 40 tool fixed all my problems,177,10
1092,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works great my only complaint is i can not take the hose off the clamp and put it back by myself,20,11
1093,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,my forced air is stronger than the arm,9,12
1094,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this product does what it says it will do free up one hand so you can dry and brush the dog at the same time my only concern was that it was very hard to squeeze the clamp to attach it to the table,45,13
1095,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,exactly what it says it is very pleased,8,14
1096,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,exactly what i needed to help me dry my old english sheepdogs i tried to fashion one of these for myself and it was an epic fail this one works perfectly,31,15
1097,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,poor value very high price materials used worth 500 limited use no value to us poor customer service because of return policy recommend to other buyers that it is a uselessphoto indicates that dog must be moved around to dry her / him,43,16
1098,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,works perfect now i can keep both my has on my dogs / cats,12,17
1099,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i use this to hold a shower head to wash my dogs in the sink in the laundry room it gets rusty after 6 month because of the splash of water so i just bought a new one photo attached,40,18
1100,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,wanted to like it i could not squeeze the handles when i was able too clamp it on it would pop off,22,19
1101,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is ok it holds the dryer hose well but the extension is not long enough to clap onto theof a table and dry pets from the top down which is important when grooming yorkies cresties and shihtzus this is not a must havebut it serves it is purpose well,50,20
1102,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this thing was in my cart for a very long time i thought it was too pricey for what it was and was looking for cheaper things to use i ended up buying a cell phone clamp which worked great for my metro quick-draw force dryer but when i bought the big-daddy metro force dryer it would not hold the heavier hose i finally bit the bullet and bought it and it makes my home grooming so much easier it is very study but forgiving when moving it i usually take the nozzle off my hose and turn it all the way down so i can use it as a fluff dryer love the size too mine came all black which i like better than the orange,126,21
1103,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,clamps are too hard to open mine broke off where the clamp piece meets the flex pipe after only a year,21,22
1104,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,works protective rubber tips come off and tear very easily,10,23
1105,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it does not fit the hose with an attachment on it and the clamps are so stiff i can barely get it on the end of the hose without the attachment,30,24
1106,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,very difficult to position and to squeeze the grips do not use on plastic,15,25
1107,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,strong grip bend to where you want it holds in place,11,26
1108,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,is there a softer version of this very handy tool i can not even press the clips open enough to clip onto my grooming table and yes i do open my own pickle jars the clip on the other end is also so strong that i fear it will crush the hard plastic at the end of my dryer hose i would recommend this product only to the incredible hulk,69,27
1109,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this did not hold up my nozzle to my dryer at all,13,28
1110,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,my wife wanted a hands-free hairdryer holder and this fit the bill perfectly i mounted this to a cabinet door in the toilet area next to my wifes sink it is been hanging there for a few months and has not fallen yet despite a few head bumps on my part,49,29
1111,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps take super strength to open i could not do it donated to goodwill,15,30
1112,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm did not attach tightly to the table moved around and the arm was so stiff it took two hans to adjust,23,31
1113,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,this is a very bad design i am going to return mine,12,32
1114,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,need strength in your hands to work these clips but once attached great,15,33
1115,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,excellent sturdy and able to hold the weight of a hand drier also only problem is needing to have strong hands to open and shut the clamp but then if it were not tight it would let slip the thing it is holding would not it,43,34
1116,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,too hard to open much too strong a grip i do not bother using it at all because it is so difficult to use and i am not a weakling,29,35
1117,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this is great frees up both hands for combing / brushing,9,36
1118,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,received as advertised works great great packaging fully recommended seller,10,37
1119,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,this thing is poor quality for the price the reviewer that said replace the rubber tips withtape was spot on as soon as i tried to use the clamp the rubber tips slide off and cracked junk the arm itself is weak the weight of my dryer makes it drop down so i had to mount it high and place dryer on the bottom so gravity would help position instead of fight it i paid 32 at 15 it would have been worth the price at 32 it is not a good deal,95,38
1120,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,too hard to to bend or open the clamps men probably can do it but i could not,17,39
1121,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the clamps do not want to stay clamped to anything and if you do get it to stay put as soon as you move the arm the clamp let us go,29,40
1122,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,it is very nice and really helps to dry the coat of show dogs there is one small issue however it takes awhile to loosen the clamps and until that happens it is really difficult for me to open the clamps wide enough to use but then I had rather have it this way than the reverse such that the clamps open easily upon first purchase and then become too loose after use all and all a good buy,76,41
1123,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamp on the bottom of the table does not hold tight you may turn the flexible arm upside down and use the other end of the clamp and it will do the same it is not tight enough for when you move the dryer hose around there has constant fixing and adjusting something that you do not you should not be doing when a dog in on the table,66,42
1124,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the rubber clips always slip off the arm can not hold up the weight of a human hairdryer clamps are very stiff,21,43
1125,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is great for what it is suppose to do but the clamps are really hard to open and after being clamped on the table for a while it left a mark but it is worth it if slight damage to your table is not a big issue also my table has a vinyl coat on the top so it is easy to damage it with something like this the coil part is easy to maneuver and the clamps swivel making it pretty simple to get it right where you want it,90,44
1126,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the clamps need hands of steel to open the hose is almost impossible to aim what a waste of money perhaps the worst thing i have ever purchased from amazon,30,45
1127,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,i do love this product and it is very helpful but i do not use it as often as i thought i would still it does the job,26,46
1128,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,grooming my 3 yorkies takes time this dryer surely cuts that time in half only drawback is the really hard spring in the clip almost have to use two hands to get it open enough to clamp on the table other than that it is a great deal,47,47
1129,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,not flexible am unable to aim the dryer end where i need it to be the grip is too tight I am afraid it will break my dryer hose end,29,48
1130,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i actually used this arm to mount a video baby monitor near the crib to get the best vantage point without hanging over the crib itself this arm worked very well each clamp is strong and stays in place i was even able to temporarily unscrew one clamp to cover the arm with a baby mobile arm cover to match the room decor the arm itself positions well and is stiff enough to stay where you set it just what i needed,82,49
1131,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,the arm is so stiff it is impossible to move it around to dry different areas of the dog if you just want one to stay in one spot it is great if you want to dry the whole dog it is a huge disappointment,44,50
1132,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,it does a great job i do not have a problem with it at allit is easy to mount and i can angle it just where i need it my hands are free to do the dogs thanks so much,40,51
1133,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,saved me a fortune as i use my blow dryer with this instead of the expensive forced air dryer and since i have show quality persians and exotic shorthairs to groom daily i am totally satisfied fits perfect on any and all my grooming tables or counter tops,48,52
1134,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,it is too hard to open and grab the blower it can be useful if you just install and leave like that permanently but not to travel as i needed,30,53
1135,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in thisi was acutally hoping for the help of a third arm but it fails to be able to hold my dryer hose while it is turned on,34,54
1136,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,everything is really good only problem is little bit strong and it makes little hard to use for ladies other than really is working,24,55
1137,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,this is a simple product and it does what it says it does my biggest complaints is that for a me the clamps are very hard to squeeze open anyone with any hand strenght issues might not be able to open the clamps the other thing is the little rubber tips on the end of the clamps fell off the first time i used them overall a very good quality product the product has been great for me,78,56
1138,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,thisworked as discribed and was a life saver in my work with the dogs i have to groom it is everything it claims to be in it is advertisement and a definite must for all groomers who have more then 4 pets a day to wash and groom,48,57
1139,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,i bought this to hold my force dryer while grooming my dogs it does not really work and i have not been able to sucessfully use it yet and I have had it for about 2 months it will not stay in place the clamps just slide around on the counter maybe it would work better if you had a counter top that was not smooth the clamps are really hard to get open so getting the dryer tube inside the clamps is a 2 person job on the bright side i can use the gooseneck piece to make a better device for this purpose,100,58
1140,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the basicof this grooming arm is good but what you will not realize until you get it is that it takes someone with superhuman strength to operate the clips are extremely difficult to open in fact they are impossible for me to be able to open far enough to secure my dryer and clip to a table even when using both hands it was too complicated to return so it is now sitting on top of a shelf in my grooming room unused,83,59
1141,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4.0,positive,does what it is supposed to do but expect the black plastic endcaps to come off the first time you use it i intend to use some epoxy to glue them on permanently this is the only issue that kept me from giving the device a 5-star rating,46,60
1142,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i mean who could not use a third arm when trying to dry a dog this product is perfect for freeing up your hands and your concentration when drying your pet it is well-made with heavy bolts and clamps it is flexible yet it stays in the position you set it to get your work done each grip comes with holes on both sides which allow you to bolt this product to your grooming table you will want to do that otherwise you will not enjoy it is full benefit meaning you will have to use two hands to reset the grip if you need to adjust it during a drying session nuts screws and washers for securing it to your work station are not included in the packaging it would be nice although if they were,131,61
1143,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,this clamps very tightly to my grooming table and hold my dryer in place without any fuss leaving my hands free,21,62
1144,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,2.0,negative,the arm came as described and in a short time which was nice however i find that I am not using it at all every time i put my hair blower on it to groom my dogs i end up taking it down because it is easier to just use my hand i was really hoping to free up 1 hand it keeps falling towards the table when my blower is in it,71,63
1145,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,5.0,positive,i used this with a blow dryer on my grooming table to finish the head and face of my dogs i was afraid it might not support the weight of the dryer but it is not even an issue no matter where i position it or twist it it holds it wherever i place it i did not have the money for a conventional stand dryer but i think I shall be just find as long as i have the third arm,80,64
1146,Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,1.0,negative,i purchased third arm mainly so that i can put my dryer into the third arm to have my arms free to hold the cat and to comb the cat totally what it is intended and designed to do for me it was really hard to clamp the third arm to the counter top i needed to use two arms than i clamped the blow dryer to the top arm but than when i had a wet cat ready to blow dry i could not move the third arm i tried to twist the top clamp lightly and it just fell off eventually i was able to screw it back on after i blew dry my cat without third arm but than on next blow dry the top clamp just flew off again off the rod hitting on impact me my cat and the mirror in front really useless if you use metro dryer the dryer is powerful and will blow with force enough to rip off the top clamp off the flexible rod it is now sitting in the basement as a bulb holder i could do without,190,65
1346,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,in arizona around the big lake area in the white mountains i found several forest road numbers that are incorrect even in the city of tucson the map has alvernon way not crossing the rillito river there is a very nice bridge at the river all of these mistakes are in a small area but i know these places how can these maps be trusted in areas one does not know that is unless you do not mind being lost in the forest i contacted garmin and their response was to carry back-up navagational maps so i guess they do not trust their own maps buy national geographic state topos in my experience they have never been wrong,115,0
1347,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i purchased this for my garmin vista hcx and the two make an unbeatable combo i can be on a trail in the mountains and request a route home the route will state something like this go north to forest trail 122 4 miles turn right on forest trail 122 go to farm road co123 12 miles turn right on i25 43 miles arrive at home 123 miles 65 hours the miles listed are the trail miles and not straight line distance when i have passed a national forest sign that says jones park 17 miles and checked the distance on my gps it matches exactly the find feature is good as well want to know if there are any hot springs in your hiking area do a find on hot spring and the nearest one will be listed and you can plot a route to it as shown above overall a very good product that i highly recommend,160,1
1348,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,this product is not very user friendly and took us hours to figure out how to use,17,2
1349,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it for all intents and purposes useless it did not show topographic lines and was very difficult to find a particular place i returned it,25,3
1350,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,although these maps lack a lot of the detail of 24k topo maps they are easy toand use i use an oregon 600,25,4
1351,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,not very good coverage for arizona disappointed in the detail around quartzsite arizona,13,5
1352,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,a definiteup for my gps really helps in navigating in the back country however it is a bit pricey,21,6
1353,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,if you use your gps off road at all it is must have information it makes getting out and about safer and more entertaining your gps unit will need to have memory available for storage shop smart,36,7
1354,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the disc comes with no directions the basecamp program that comes with it is seriously out of date after spending hours w tech support we got everything figured out and i was able to do what i needed,37,8
1355,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,topo maps are missing a lot of information shame on you garmin people depend on the accuracy of the maps that you sell,23,9
1356,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this is the defacto standard map for the serious hiker backpacker mountain biker or off road enthusiest the mapsonto your pc hard drive to work with mapsource theya little slow on my machine when you zoom in or out but i attribute this to the small memory in my laptop,54,10
1357,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,ok i felt i had to post this review because of the other review i also had trouble getting it up and running the problem is not with the maps it is with the software that reads the maps i spent some time with garmin tech support free and very helpful the problem is these old discs have a much older version of basecamp on them to make this work you need to go to garmins website and get current basecamp also free install it before you install the maps one other thing the big difference between these and the garmin 100k topo is that these have routable trails and roads as well as lots more detail this is what you need for adventure planning,125,11
1358,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the maps have great detail they are easy to download to my gps or print out fairly easy to figure out by using the help button,25,12
1359,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,I am very disappointed with this expensive high resolution map i use my garmin 62stc for hiking but there are very few trails on here including the well established well maintained trails prior to this i used the neo treks app with my iphone which had many trails on very inexpensive maps the garmin gps outperforms the iphone but these maps are a big disappointment,65,13
1360,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,was very disappointed in the quality of the displays was expecting the map would look very much like a usgs map instead it seems like a kid with a pen sort of traced the contours more important the shading for open areas against timber is missing so parks and meadows can not be differentiated from forest,55,14
1361,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,it will notinto the computer when i try tothe program it will not run even when i try to do it manually,25,15
1362,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,works great with my new garmin oregon 450 glad i ordered this against getting the 100k version which other reviewers have said is about useless I am happy with this,29,16
1363,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the instructions with dvd are minimal and do not work nowhere on the packaging or the dvd does it tell you how much memory is required and that you might need to add an sd card to increase storage capacity the manual for my device is minimal in content poorly written and indexed the online help people at garmin online support contact you once a day i am now on day three trying toa garmin map onto a garmin device,81,17
1364,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,hike and atv in the south west find this to be helpful make sure you downthe up dates,20,18
1365,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,very difficult toon my toshiba lap top then once i got it loaded i went on line to see what program supported the program non was showmen i tried adding it to a couple of programs none will support it feel like i invested money that i can not use,51,19
1366,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,great topo maps but lack trail and road detail below the level of paved roads the maps do not even have fire roads let alone established trails in regional parks the iphone with google maps provides better detail and is much simpler to use there are apps for smart phones that will record routes without having to mark way points besides maps on a smart phone are free and are undated automatically basically the garmin maps and gps off-road devices are dated and difficult to use i have spent many hours and hundreds of dollars on a garmin gps sd card and maps only find they make and interesting paper weight save your money and put it into a good smart phone,121,20
1367,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good maps not exactly a usgs topo but still good with the contours and on the ground identifiers the files are big being over 3 gb however you better have a big micro sd chip in your garmin or other gps,41,21
1368,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,the 24k topographic map is functional and works fine the hiking trails indicated on the map are not at all accurate on the several hikes i done since purchasing none are correct the indicated path varies from the actual trails by sometimes more than half a mile not a good thing if you are in deep woods if you want accurate trails for hiking buy something else,67,22
1369,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,unable to make version work that was installed on memory card internal memory version works well although does not appear the same on gps as on pc,27,23
1370,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,this dvd does not open on my macintosh i do not know why or where to find out why there is no manual the garmin website is full of hundreds of products and no good information,35,24
1371,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i think the map is good far more accurate than the default map which comes installed on the gps unit in order to use it on my montana gps i had to copy the data to a memory card i truly dislike the micro sd card it is very small and hard to handle drop it on a backpacking trip and you will never find it,66,25
1372,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,the first map i ever got for a trail gps garmin gpsmap 60csx segments are easily loaded to the gps from the pc on which the map is loaded i did not find the colors of the map as hard to make out as some reviewers have said the map does not have as many labelled features as I had like i was using it hiking in the escalante-grand staircase natl monument i found things on google earth for example that are not on the map but these are easily downloaded to the gps if one remembers to do it before leaving home i also found walking on an established trail that the gps tracked me about 100 feet off to the side of it was this a fault of the gps or the map i do not know room for improvement yes adequate to get you where you want to go certainly,148,26
1373,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,good price it is a complete set very fast safe delivery have not used it for a couple of years,20,27
1374,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed to find that this was the old version of the product next time i will buy from a retailer so i view the product and make sure it the current version tjm,36,28
1375,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought a new garmin gps for hiking and thought i would order a download from garmin covering all the southwest i am new to the gps world and did not know that this did not include hiking trails so needless to say i wasted my money do not order this if you are wanting detailed hiking trails bob,59,29
1376,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,purchased these maps for a hike in the area of the holly cross wilderness in colorado the maps were quite good except that the trails were either missing or sometimes incorrect i used the maps in my e-trex 20 gps and i was pleased with many options that the gps provided the problem is that even the paper maps often have incorrect trails it is not clear to me whether this is garmins fault or usgs fault in any event even with incorrect trail and a gps you can easily see where your are going and whether the trail is leading into the direction you would like to go i used amazon credit card offer to purchase the maps so for me it was 40 which seems to be reasonable i am not sure i would be that content with the product had i spend in excess of 100 which is the cost of the maps on garmins web page,160,30
1377,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,purchased these topo-maps for off-road exploring in our jeep and loaded on a [ new ] garmin 2595 the 2595 has more than adequate memory capacity for both street and topo maps no chip required thou i have read many folks douse their topo-maps on a micro sd so far I am very pleased the maps accurately depict 90 of the secondary primitive and mining-roads as-well-as geographical features and sites in the area of az where we live have not so-far used them outside of a 150 - 200 square-miles of home-base but in our case for our purposes well worth the price,100,31
1378,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,have been using the maps in northern az getting ready for elk hunt works great in the thick timber great buy,20,32
1379,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i have both west and southwest 24k topo maps and neither dvd drive on my mac pro will read them this is despite the claim on the face of the dvds that they are for mac and pc,38,33
1380,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,these maps are decent although you can get free topo maps i found out that are pretty much as good the only issue i have yet to discover these maps should support the 3d view on the oregon 450 I shall know in about 6 weeks if that is accurate or not free maps do not have that support,59,34
1381,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,i have used garmins map for about a month and find it very useful while the national forest roads are not all numbered they are shown as are the major hiking trails through the superstition wilderness the maps are great for planning hikes knowing the length and elevaton change of any route considered it is also great to see where we have hiked and know what we are facing before we leave the maps work great on my legend hcx we will be getting additional maps for other areas that we spend time in,90,35
1382,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,i found this map easily loaded on my computer and then i just downloaded a portion of the map the area i use on my garmin and it works great,28,36
1383,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,this map works great for sure the cool thing is you canon as may cards as you would like for various gpss,24,37
1384,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,the maps work very well with my garmin nuvi showing me features that i am interested in to 4wheel on it goes very nicely with the other map programs i have i installed it and one phone call to garmin was all it took to correct one little mistake i made all i had to due was restart the program to make it work,64,38
1385,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,garmin mapsource topo us 24k is a definite improvement over it is 100k series but unfortunately is incompatible with gps 60cs it works great on my pc but on the gps 60cs the contour lines completely fill the screen obscuring the map i upgraded my garmin 60cs with the latest firmware update but the contour lines still obscure the map i am very unsatisfied with garmins topo series of maps,69,39
1386,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,these garmin maps are a total waste of time poor resolution and detail no poi labels not much to like go to above the timber at [ ] and get the real deal,32,40
1387,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i bought garmin topo southwest easy to install other than that the product is way over priced for what you get I have been using the old delorme topo 30 garmin just does not compare i hunt in southwest colorado roads are miss labeled or just are just not shown continental divide not shown major trails ie continental divide trail rainbow trail colorado trail not shown a lot of garbage that an outdoorsman does not need who needs to know where shopping centers or an atm are when hunting or as garmin puts it on the trail the reason for the purchase was to put a copy on my etrex legend hcx and i wanted to print maps from my pc well i tried printing a map to an hp laserjet printer and it printed the navteq logo over the map i tried to a second printer an hp inkjet same thing after an hour on hold with technical support the technician told me garmin is aware of the problem and i should do a print screen well the same thing printed i logged into my amazon account and sent it back,189,41
1388,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is safe to say that most gps units are not made to be as user friendly as possible and this software is no different however it is not that difficult to use and will help you get a lot more out of your gps having said that it is ridiculous that you have to pay so much to get these maps i got the southwest maps because that is where i live and do most of my hiking but I am taking a trip to backpack in montana soon and it just is not worth it to buy the separate map dvd for that trip if these things were cheaper i would have amazons price is much better than most others but still very high compared to maps for gps units from other manufacturers i guess it is cheaper than buying lots of paper maps but you have to do that anyway because you are crazy if you rely only on your gps when you are in a place where navigation is a serious concern,167,42
1389,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,it is a map the detail is good for me i did notice that some dirt roads were not accurate when compared with your tracks but that has not been a problem,31,43
1390,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,as with most garmin products this is an excellent map program much more details than the older programs it does take a while to install on your hard drive but who cares,32,44
1391,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,great product very fas shipping i would buy it again if necessary,12,45
1392,Software,B001RYK0JE,1.0,negative,i purchased this software to be able to research and print maps for backcountry exploration by jeep and hiking i routinely use usgs blm and other topo maps but i purchased this to be able to customize and print maps from anywhere in the southwest it is impossible to print maps because the software will put a huge navteq logo across the page when it prints garmin has no solutions this software is garbage and a total waste of money,80,46
1393,Software,B001RYK0JE,5.0,positive,perfect for what i want very detailed and easy to use,11,47
1394,Software,B001RYK0JE,4.0,positive,has good features hard to use need to watch youtube videos to help figure it out,16,48
1395,Software,B001RYK0JE,2.0,negative,very disappointed the map has less detail than the 100k topo map that was pre-installed on my montana garmin should be ashamed,22,49
1396,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this is just what i have been looking for i am a ballroom dancer and have many songs on of old cds whose files do not come up on the computer leaving me with dozens of songs marked track 2 track 3 with no info i need to keep my files in order i just downloaded the free demo version on this program and i was blown away it took only seconds to identify organize and find cover art for some very obscure songs amazing no more mystery songs i am going to buy the full featured version immediately,98,0
1397,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this program is fantastic it will find the correct names and order things should be put in it will find your album art it does it all you can even see videos of your song from youtube the only small problem i have is a lot of music has very poor album art i end up having to search for the album art myself but it does give you album art most are in the 300x300 400x400 range I am pretty picky and want 500 so that when i click on the album art it is nice and big other than that it is a great product and i highly recommend it,108,1
1398,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,the other reviewer does not seem to like this product maybe it is his computer but I am also using a macbook running snow leopard and i love this software it takes about 2 - 3 seconds per song but that is exactly how long they say it should take this program fixed my 3000 song library really fast and there has only like 50 or so songs that do not have the correct album art but it is way better than before and worth the money if your still unsure about this program there is a trial you can get at their webstite that will clean 100 songs i recommend it,104,2
1399,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,i used it for two windows xp computers one one it worked fine with 2 gb ram and on the other it locked up several times 1 gb ram i suspect you might have issues if you do not have at least 2 gb overall i am very pleased with it i cleaned up a library of over 5000 songs with a high degree of accuracy although a handful of songs were overwritten with titles in foreign alphabets nothings perfect but i feel like i got a lot of value out of it,92,3
1400,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not purchase tuneup does not work do not waist your money not worth it company does not care no product support likely to be going out of business soon,30,4
1401,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,this program works great does what it says it will do and is easy to use i would recommend it to anyone who wants to clean up their music library it does what itunes will not do,37,5
1402,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product delivers as advertised it does a good job of straightening out tags and filling in all the information to test it first i took 5 songs and changed the tags incorrectly tune-up corrected all of them successfully my only complaint is that it is a little slower than i would like but i have a 9000 song library this is definitely worth the 40 lifetime price,70,6
1403,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this product some time ago and wanted to come on here to warn others against buying this software not only does it incorrectly tag many songs it takes a tremendous time to do so and freezes constantly i have used the program on two different computers including a macbook pro and it has frozen on both it may do an acceptable job of identifying fairly well-known rock songs but good luck if your collection includes hip hop electronic or certain older songs even common rock such as the rolling stones steer clear of this product it will save you a lot of hassle,105,7
1404,Software,B00266PHBI,2.0,negative,this is like the smart phone apps shazam or soundhound for music you already have on your computer but is unlabeled potentially valuable time-saving tool but ultimately disappointing implementation I have used it intermittently for for two or three years every now and then i use it to label tracks i do not want to do manually for example when i rip mixed cds from friends and have more than a handful of unlabeled tracks too often it can not recognize a tune sometimes it tuneup just hangs working but not producing results matching album art to tunes was equally disappointing a lot of the album pics were completely wrong the time you spend correcting the mistakes makes this not worth the expense,119,8
1405,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,tune-up is a very disappointing product it failed to recognize duplicates as it claimed it would worse i had to pay an additional 2000 to tune-up after purchasing it from amazon in order to find unlimited duplicates in my music files which includes over 5000 songs the package as shipped limited de-dupping to 50 songs it located no more than 2 dozen duplicates itunes is still able to reveal over 50 remaining duplicates without tune-up the product claims to find all missing album art but my collection is still missing album art on several dozen albums although admittedly some are quite obscure numerous albums show the wrong cover including covers from other artists entirely tune-up was a total waste of money,119,9
1406,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i actually bought the software in a store and upon installation it promptly downloaded an update this update simply does not recognize my activation code that came with the store software but acts like a free trial version and cheerfully let us me know that i have run out of my free service so i go to the website convinced that this certainly must be a mistake but it is not the new service works as annual or lifetime service for additional fee that is it became a webservice instead of a standalone application but they forgot to notify vendors about this who still sell it as the latter and this makes it a plane rip off the software seems to be a greatbut even when it worked it appeared buggy freezy pathetic you can achieve more by doing everything manually than relying on this piece of s tware,149,10
1407,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,be careful of getting a lifetime membership with tune up because your activation code will only work once or twice i sold my old computer and got a new one and even tech support can not solve my issue of transferring the activation key to my new computer super lame it is as if they are at the mercy of their own slow / glitchy software,62,11
1408,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,the software works on my pc running windows 7 however you have to register and download version 199 and get a new activation code from tech support they are nice and very helpful amazon needs to sell the latest version so you do not have to go through all the hoops this software is not for beginners in my opinion it works but not as expected,66,12
1409,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,do not bother using this program it might work for you for a little while but eventually it will force you to update and one of these updates will break the program you will spend hours upon hours trying to get it to work again you might get lucky and figure it out after 4 - 5 hours of trying but more than likely you will just be unable to use the program for months and months possibly up to a year while you wait on the program to come out with a new update there has a reason it has so many negative reviews it is awesome when it works but it stays broken a good portion of the time I have never understood why they will not leave good enough alone,124,13
1410,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,this software no longer works with the latest version of itunes it is simply criminal that it is still being sold,21,14
1411,Software,B00266PHBI,1.0,negative,i purchased this software for 3995 and within 2 weeks before i had the chance to use it they went out of business i cannotthe software at all crooks,33,15
1412,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,my itunes library was a mess this product tuned it up works awesome just as promised now my library is up to date with album artwork found or corrected i highly recommend this product,34,16
1413,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,while this software is awesome it is not perfect i can not imagine any that would be perfect tuneup actually shocked me i did not think that there was anything on the market that would work anywhere near as good as this I am impressed if you have any doubt at all download the lite version and test it out that is what i did before i purchased it i have not used the cover art yet but my main concern was missing info for songs and duplicates so clean and deduper are what i have used fyi you can find coupon codes online and get a good discount i have seen coupons so far up to 60 off,113,17
1414,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,tuneup does what I have bought it for it has been able to successfully arrange most of my songs and get the right album artwork and this is not limited to american songs alone I had recommend this to anyone anyday,39,18
1415,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,as a bestselling author of non-fiction investigative books i do not have time to keep my itunes library in any kind of order i took a chance on tune up expecting the worst 24 hours later i opened itunes and found it in astonishing order some album covers were still missing but i found only one error mozart by don giovani instead of don giovani by mozart and this was a minimalist version of tune up bravo sterling seagrave,78,19
1416,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,especially if you have a big messy library with lots of different sources like mine tuneup worked wonders making complete sense of my library and making the de-duplication task insanely easy highly recommended,33,20
1417,Software,B00266PHBI,4.0,positive,this product works very well it does a decent job of cleaning up song titles and other information i had a very large 17 gb itunes library and it is now 999 accurate the only tracks tuneup could not fix i was also unable to fix manually so i think that is pretty good my only complaint is that when it finds album titles and artwork the majority of the time it will offer up greatest hits or other compilation albums rather than the original album on which the track was released,91,21
1418,Software,B00266PHBI,5.0,positive,I have been using tuneup for a while now and i have to say i love it it does exactly what it is supposed to do it cleans the track info and album art additionally the concerts feature is great for me because i have a giant library and it is tough to keep track of who is in town and when tuneup is amazing for making your music library more presentable which is great for ios devices because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better they also just sent me a coupon code for friends and family for 40 off at their website for anyone interested in a deal the code is friends40 either way i highly recommend this product,121,22
1419,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,installation works well but keep in mind that unlike the 2009 map that it replaces the 2010 map can not all fit in the internal built in memory of my 260w you will need to decide what to install eg 49 lower states or eastern north americayou have about 5 options the only way around this is to put the rest of the map on an sd card,70,0
1420,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i prefer using the dvd for the update it was an easy process have had a problem with the download process before,22,1
1421,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,there is not a lot to say about map updates for a gps but upgrading my nuvi to the latest maps and points of interet pois was a painless experience i just put the dvd in my mac and then connected the gps to my computer the updates installed and I am set,52,2
1422,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i bought the one time 2011 maps for my garmin 260w gps on dvd and tried to install it after many crashes it finally installed on my gps or so it said when i turned the gps on it said i no longer had any maps rendering my gps into a doorstop i spent hours with garmin support even giving them control my computer so they couldthemselves they failed repeatedly and had me try loading from the temp file as a last resort of course this also failed and now i get to try to contact them again which can take forever just to find someone else there with another badto try of course they will not suggest replacing the dvd as they now have my money and i now have my doorstop i will never buy garmin again,143,3
1423,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i want to update my garmin nuvi 765 t this looked like what i needed after reading the reviews i wanted to make sure i had the most current update i chatted online with amazon and while very helpful they could not verify if this was for 2012 or not on further research i called garmin they gave me the part number for the onetime 2012 update it is 010 - 10989 - 54 and told me the box is blue white and gray the one amazon is selling ends in 03 so it is an earlier version 2009 not the 2012 so buyer beware i love amazoncom but make sure you are getting exactly what you want and do not just go for the deal buy this particularfrom garmin it is about 10 more plus shipping but you will get the most recent update available that is what i am doing,148,4
1424,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i hope if you buy this you wait for it to go on sale or lightning deal i picked it up for 35 bucks for my nuvi 760 for the people that complained that they needed to get an sd card they clearly should have done their homework before buying the upgrade do you expect just any tires to fit on your car just because you have a car seriously of course it is the manufactures problem that they do not have space i think you need about 780 mb of free space say 1 g to be safe to install the full north america map if you do not have an expansion slot you are really sol with this upgrade,115,5
1425,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i got this on the lightning round for 2999 for my older garmin c320i tried to install on my windows 7 pc but windows keep closing the program and it erased the operating system in the gps had to reinstall off of garmin website i then tried on my windows xp pc and it worked great took about a hour to update without any problems,62,6
1426,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,avoid at all costs I have been trying to do this for over 8 hours i am on third attempt locked up two different computers update-installed the disc in my computer waited the download out right before it finished the download it had an error message corrupted data if problem persists contact garmin customer service 3 time it did this i emailed garmin customer service the had me clarify on three different responses which came early morning so i assume customer service is in india i had at least 7 responses and a phone call while i was at work from garmin with no solutions except to retry installing with the disc finally i told him I had just get a magellan or a tomtom he used the old we are an american company and i should reconsider i am very pro american made purchasing but between your customer service probably in india and your product making my gps a useless brick i will shop else where thank you very much,168,7
1427,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have tried to install it for about 5 hours at this point i have tried three computers at first it would crash early on but i was able to bypass the autorun and start the installer manually at this point i was able to get it to download all the updates but it took two hours i have a very fast connection but it was very slow it was within 1 minute of being done when the installer program crashed now when i start over it wants to download from the beginning it is not worth it if i could just return it i would but i have entered my key so i am stuck,116,8
1428,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,my nuvi 200 just did n't have enough room to accomadate the full united states maps so you have to select the next best map to suit your needs easy install tho,30,9
1429,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this was so much easier than the download process from garmin i updated my nuvi 650 with no problems,19,10
1430,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i am one of those who purchased the code sunday may 2 and could not download it it is working fine now i am happy to report and it is updating just fine i docked them a star for the pain yesterday,42,11
1431,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was great roads that i would not come up previously now come up when i enter the address keeping the maps updated ensures new roads are available and the cd was so easy to use i highly recommend it,40,12
1432,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i ordered the 2009 version cancelled it then received the 2010 version in 2 days 2010 version was wrong and i still have to return 2009amazons ordering is constantly wrong,30,13
1433,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i wish i had read more of the reviews and forums beforehand this has been a time consuming process due to the limited information they provide up front and lengthy customer service wait times tried garmins online help and email help but they continue to provide the same steps after explaining in detail it has not resolved the issue no detailed maps found that support routing,66,14
1434,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i have downloaded the garmin update into my unit and find that there has not been any update at all the unit still insists that i need to update it and i do not know what to do please contact me if at all possible with either a new unit or a suggestion as to how to make this work thank you,62,15
1435,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,after spending [ ] to update the maps on my garmin nuvi 265 t i now have a gps which takes 5 minutes to turn andup the maps and it is completely silent no sound i checked the volume settings and it is at 80 t no soun bud comes out of the unit try getting support from garmin every time i call i am put on hold with an estimated wait time of at least 30 minutes who has time for that i think i will just go out and buy a tom tom which is what i should have done in the first place instead of updating something 3 years old,113,16
1436,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,easy to use and invaluable provided the updates i needed and did not lock me into anything more than a one-time upgrade as i might get a new gps sometime soon,30,17
1437,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i needed to update my streetpilot c550 since it was several years old i read in other reviews of some horrors with some of the updates i will have to say i had no problem eventhough it took several hours i am now seeing highways that had not been on my garmin previously the only reason i gave it only four stars is the cost of the update the price is rather steep for a one time use,79,18
1438,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,the ordering shipping and receipt process was excellent i am enjoying the product,13,19
1439,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i purchased the 2010 map update for my garmin gps soon after i installed the update on my gps the touch screen function of the unit froze up and ceased to work the unit will find the satellite start up as normal but will not allow any touch function to operate so the unit is now useless i do not konw if the update is responsible for this malfunction but my gps worked properly prior to the installation,77,20
1440,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,i received the updates and installed them on my garmin it definitely made a difference there are streets on there that my old garmin maps did not recognize i am over all very pleased with the updated maps,37,21
1441,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i was hoping that this update would map some areas that were not included when i originally purchased my device did not happen to be fair the service that supplies map data to garmin is not doing their job and my friends bmw does not these areas correctly either it will be a few years before i do another update,60,22
1442,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,it was a snap to install i had tried updates online but had difficulty even getting my unit registered using the cd is much easier,25,23
1443,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,with the prices of gps units dropping it is tempting to just replace the whole unit as the maps age and need updating at full list price for an update that is exactly what i would have done but at a reasonable discounted price 50 rather than 70 i chose to do the update it was easy and went smoothly my 3 year old garmin gps is now as current maps-wise as new out-of-the-box unit my only wish and what would have made this upgrade 5 stars is that the software would also update the operating system of the nuvi and not just the map data the newer operating systems lock on to satellites much faster than the older ones and the map displays have been somewhat improved as well,130,24
1444,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i reside in a rural area of the southeast the garman 2010 map update gives significantly more detail and is much more reliable than the 2008 version although I am not terribly demanding it has not failed to locate any poi that i have requested,44,25
1445,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,the garmin gps software i purchased works as described several changes have been included i can recommend this procust,19,26
1446,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,the map update is listed as compatible with the nvi 200 series but it turns out that the update files are too big for the 200s internal memory it is possible to do the update but only by adding an sd card in the 200s slot and loading the bulk of the update onto that instead of the internal memory there is no documentation or web resource at garmin that i could find to explain this and the process for doing it is not entirely self-evident,86,27
1447,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,this map update is compatible with the zumo 550 i use for motorcycle touring the installation was easy although it took well over an hour unattended to complete i get these map updates every year and find them to be worth the price the update also installed a new version of mapsource the desktop application that allows creating routes that can be downloaded to the gps it is compatible with the existing data files so you will not lose access to routes you may have already created in prior versions an important tip this will only update one garmin unit keyed to the units serial number shortly after installing this map my garmin had to be replaced because i accidentally damaged the touchscreen a quick call to garmin after i received my replacement unit had them reassign this map update to the new units serial number so i couldit into the new gps good service from garmin,157,28
1448,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i do not know how many streets changed in the two years since i owned my nuvi 350 but not enough to warrant a new set of maps costing 60 to 70 for a product costing 199 but what really is upsetting is that i have two nuvi 350s one for my brother and they will not let me update both nuvis with one dvd this reminds me of the days when software publishers overpriced software and got rigid with copy protection schemes they stopped more legal sales than they stopped piracy eventually software publishers got more friendly about both prices and second installations with lots more happy customers for their efforts garmin should have allowed me to use my 60 map update on both nuvis or made it cheap enough i would not feel so ripped off now i am just ticked off next time I shall try tom-tom or wait for a decent iphone app,153,29
1449,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have received my garmin 2010 map updates on a timely basis and am satisfied with the product,18,30
1450,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,update would notinto my street pilot 7200 without tec help after tec help the 7200 did not perform as well as before the update many of the secondary roads were missing that came with the original program i would not recommend this update,45,31
1451,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,unfortunately i made a bad mistake this was not a garmin map it was just an update for the people who has a garmin with a older version of the map as i rated this a very good map and the price was somehow good,45,32
1452,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,bear in mind folks this cd will update only one garmin unit if you have 2 or more i have 3 one in each of 2 cars and 1 in my motor home you will have to buy 2 or more,42,33
1453,Software,B0026MTATW,4.0,positive,this product updated my nuvi 650 with no glitches whatsoever the dvd installs to the computer first and then installs the updates to the gps the entire process took about 2 1/2 hours all i had to do was enter the key number on the inside of the dvd sleeve i did not have to go to the garmin site as i have seen others say they did there is now streets showing that did not show on my 2008 version,78,34
1454,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,i was disappointed in the garmin numaps 2010 america one-time update we moved to a new city and were using our gps to locate stores for shopping the old maps led us to a fabric store and many others that were no longer there we were told by neighboring stores that a particular store had not been there for 10 years we thought the upgrade would solve the problem the first thing we did when we got the upgrade was look to see that this missing store had been eliminated it is still listed on the upgrade as are several other stores that have been closed for 3 years or more i do not really see any difference in the upgrade and i consider it wasted money,126,35
1455,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,upgraded my garmin with no hassle device boot up first time and everything seemed to be working perfectly good job garmin updated 3/26/2012 do not buy the one time upgrade anymore one can get the life time map update for a little more for the life time of the gps it is a worthwhile investment happy driving,56,36
1456,Software,B0026MTATW,2.0,negative,i must not have looked at it very hard but i was expecting a more up-to-date cd instead of 2011 update is there anything i can do to get a more up-to-date cd for my garmin nuvi,37,37
1457,Software,B0026MTATW,1.0,negative,did not include some map updates made between 2007 and 2009 what a joke i want my money back,19,38
1458,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,thanks for the article works great thanks for sending vyu u harto po old gt km u lo re u,20,39
1459,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,i have an old garmin unit and i did not want to pay for a lifetime map update since I shall be purchasing a new unit in a year or so and all the new units come with lifetime updates while i was waiting to purchase the new unit this one time update seemed like a greatthe microsd card works great i plugged it into my unit and the new maps were included i will use this for a year or so and then buy my new unit great deal,90,40
1460,Software,B0026MTATW,5.0,positive,was just what i needed to update my garmin save me from buying a new one now i need a new battery,22,41
2077,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,did you ever beat on a garbage can lid with a wooden spoon well that is the sound you get from cakewalks music creator 6 the guitar rythmn sound is also shabby to say the least if you want a good backup music program just invest in band in a box you will be glad you did,56,0
2078,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,well this is not a bad daw i found out after using this that i prefered cubase or sonar which is the upgraded version of cakewalk this is however a good daw to get your feet wet or to record a few mics at one time if you need to work on guitar parts you will need nothing more than this my needs have grown greatly and can not use this anymore but for the starter or small studio i do recommend this or cubase le,84,1
2079,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,because my new samson go mic has bundled cakewalk software i decided to try cakewalk music creator 6 this software is a disaster in stability the bundled software was just as bad i got to use music creator 6 only twice before it continued to come up with an error message stating that the one exe file that opens up the whole thing was missing i must have uninstalled and re-installed this software six times on my computer and cleaned up everything involved with this program short of causing problems for other programs on my computer also customer service was terrible cakewalk needs to spend more time trying out their own software with various computers and operating systems and looking for problems rather than focusing on the art of rigid programming rules musicians do not want to waste time with programming musicians want to create cakewalk should either fix these problems or take a walk do you get it cakewalk i was with this software and oh this is mild commentary as I have had two weeks to cool off a bit i sent it back to amazon for a credit thank you amazon for your graciousness,196,2
2080,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,i did not know if mc 6 would work on my laptop it works fine and will probably meet my needs when i get some additional gear and time to use it all,32,3
2081,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this is a great music arranger at a very low price point there are many instruments available and you can interface with actual midi capable instruments,26,4
2082,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,it is great fun it would be much better i had were more knowledgeable about computers and more though overall i am learning how to use the program as i play a digital piano for the price it has a multitude of capabilities for me the tough part is mastering the software i have a granddaughter that loves to record her own songs I had never tell her that she needs to work on her singing it is just great fun,74,5
2083,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,because i got music creator 5 on one of my anther computers but this program u can touch and it have everything u need to produced ur music yes it is professional,30,6
2084,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,i bought this software thinking i could use it to record songs it will not take my guitar input even although it is running through a very good usb device I have only been playing since 1966 and working with computers since they came out i have decided that it was worth the 32 dollars just to gain the knowledge that cakewalk is way to complicated for normal people,67,7
2085,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,great fun i had the advantage of my brother tutoring me on a previous version there are also some nice online tutorials it will certainly take a long time to learn everything but i was able to import and edit sounds for my avant garde music class immediately i can not tell you anything about what ever is normally in these kind of programs but for me it was awesome especially at this price,73,8
2086,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,uninstalled it was getting errors runtime errors with windows 80 pro so i upgraded to windows 81 pro from windows 80 pro but still had runtime errors uninstalled it and errors went away but i had my magix music software install no problems i stay with my magix products they work great and are easy to use,57,9
2087,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,this is somewhat an extensive program that you will have to do some study on to utilize all the features,20,10
2088,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,i had tried another software and hated it this was just what i need to compose and record my music,20,11
2089,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,product worked fine then got a free upgrade to music cretor 6 touch having issues and quirks where program now freezes up or is not responsive or needs to be forced shut because of one thing or another need to find help to find the fix to this issue also basic knowledge of the program would be very usefull since all the tutorials are not as simple as one would hope,70,12
2090,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,the music creator 6 is very cool i use it on my music prodjects i can not stop use it it cool,21,13
2091,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,one of the best things is the vidio tutorial caught me up to date quick i was using music creator 3 and jumped to 6 but for the price this works great it takes a little while to find everything but for recording with an interface module you can be recording tracks in a couple of hours i have experience in recording from reel to reel to daws to computers I am having fun with this one thanks cakewalk stvy d,79,14
2092,Software,B004TO9M5W,5.0,positive,this product is always providing new avenues of creativity in my music recording i am constantly surprised by the avenues of creativity it presents i recommend it for any beginning artist,31,15
2093,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,do not buy this first of all i spent hours just trying to get the notes to not skip there has a latency menu that you have to look online by good luck and change to correct this it should have been adjusted from the factory then you can not just go to sharps and flats on a laptop unless you have a mouse then I am not sure if it works or not the old music creator was far better then menus and windows on this are awkard and non user friendly i think I am going to look up an older version of cakewalk music creator on ebay one star because there has not an option for no stars,113,16
2094,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,I am actually reviewing music creator 7 anyway i have been fooling with it for 3 months now and i do not like it for one thing the tech support is some of the worst I have ever encountered the product is not intuitive and the in-program help is not helpful neither is the cakewalk forum i have used earlier versions of cakewalk and know a thing or two about computers but this program just is a constant headache plus all the samples and clips that come with it are trash they are all house and electronica type stuff i do not see anything in the midi library and very little in the audio library that i would ever want to use but that is ok because i have not been able to get the latency down to a reasonable delay anyway not recommended,138,17
2095,Software,B004TO9M5W,1.0,negative,may be is not your fault but i have a yamaha dgx-640 connected to the computer and i do not get no sound on the music creator 6 i followed all the directions from the creator but nothing i could use some help thanks alexndru davd,46,18
2096,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,if you are a musician like me and a recording artist you will like this software the program is simple and the software is so easy to use upon plugging in my electronic keyboard to the usb along with my microphone i can record and create songs right on my computer sa-weet,52,19
2097,Software,B004TO9M5W,2.0,negative,i spend more time being pissed at this program for latency bulls when trying to lay down more than one track at a time not to mention the crackling that never appears at the same spot in playback and recording and whenever it happens when trying to record vocals over my guitar it messes that entire vocal section up all i wanted was something that could let me lay down guitar vocals and drums in separate tracks i have a xenyx q802usb behringer to manage my eqs and i do not care much about midi so that whole part of the program is useless to me this is the first recording software I have ever tried outside of audacity and i was kinda expecting that since i was actually paying for it that it would come with a decent manual and do a good job handling my recording ha waste of my money and my time,153,20
2098,Software,B004TO9M5W,4.0,positive,although i am no expert in this field i have found a few bugs in the program but so far exporting the audio and re-importing it has solved all the issues i have ran into i have no real experience with other audio recording software other than light use of audacity and an older cakewalk home studio 9 i do wish it had better tools for mixing but it does plenty for it is price,74,21
2099,Software,B004TO9M5W,2.0,negative,this may work well but it is complicated i have not made it work well for me the reviews said it was easy but i did not find it that way,31,22
2200,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,12/19/2004 i just got this phone yesterday i love the reception and the sound quality is excellent my only grip is that you can not have multiple number per contact i had my numbers transferred from the lg6000 i had 100 contacts home and cell for each now i have 200 people in my phonebook oh well i bought this phone as a direct result of all the headset / hand free laws that passed in each state while driving I shall use this for a while with the speakerphone my next purchase is going to be the bluetooth headset,96,0
2201,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,i bought this phone in july from radio shack rs the main reason was to pair with my acura tl poor reception dropped calls static poor bluetooth abilities does not work on incoming calls in my tl communicated with rs moto and vz all three told me it was acura acura refers me to handsfree link verizon never gave them the phone for testing before moving this to production this is done with all other wireless companies rs exchanged the phone in sept oct i find that it is not the car but the phone vz bluntly told me it is my problem discuss it with rs rs said discuss it with moto moto states that they know there is a problem with the bluetooth but do not know how to distribute the fix no one will refund me the price of the phone that i bought outright and paid in excess of 400 because it is now over 30 days old i travel nationwide and have the same reception problems in all parts of the country my qualcom from 1997 and my nokia from 2001 perform better then this phone poor picture abilities can not transfer files form phone to my laptop using bluetooth as vz disabled this i will write off the phone and have my company switch me to cingular,222,1
2202,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i have been through all the cell companies t-mobile cingular at t sprint and now verizon and am happy with this phone all of the gsm phones would drop calls when i was in buildings and on the road this phone has yet to drop a call my last phone was the all in one ipaq phone that had the best feature set of any phone but what good was that if the calls dropped so i got this one and am happy the bluetooth works great with my headset and as a modem for my laptop i wish it did data transfer but that is not a deal breaker for me loss of important calls was i got the transflash off amazon for a great deal and love that ability to shuttle data between my laptop pda and phone with it all in all i am please with this phone,150,2
2203,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i traded my vx6000 for this phone this phone has been getting fairly bad reviews across the board stemming from the lack of bluetooth support from verizons end people think that you can not get information to and from the phone other than emailing back and forth but they are wrong i bought a 128 mb transflash card and a sd reader for 40 bucks total i do not have anything that can send bluetooth signals anyway so the fact that i had to buy a separate reader was not an issue i can send pictures and ringtones to and from the phone without verizon charging me the only problem with mp3 ringtones is that you have to save them to the phones internal memory so you have to chop them down and lower the quality to keep more than a few the transflash card itself is worth the extra cost of this phone i can grab pictures off the computer to use as wallpaper or as a contact identification again for free the camera is more worthless than my vx6000 indoors but outside it takes fairly decent pictures overall it is not as bad as people want you believe but i only paid 150 bucks for it after rebates and incentives,207,3
2204,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,as a phone it is ok the volume even at it is highest setting is too low it is got lots features like voice dial speaker phone most you probably will not use as a camera even although it is advertised as 12 megapixels the pictures and video are pretty worthless bluetooth 99 worthless i did not know much about bluetooth before i bought the phone so i assumed i could use bluetooth from my pc to wirelessly send pictures ringtones mp3s phonebooks and syncronize my phone up to my pc not true bluetooth has a bunch of different profiles and this phone only supports a very small number of them mostly for using the phone as a modem or with a wireless headset overall save your money and buy a less expensive phone i bought 2 of these and i like my old startacs better,148,4
2205,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,avoid this phone i had one for a year then it went dead verizon sold me a new battery but that was not the problem after four trips to the store they fedexd me a new refurbished phone which also went dead after a few weeks they gave me a third one which also went dead so they gave me a fourth phone this morning always the same problem the screen says unable to charge verizon can not explain what that means but it must be more than a problem with the battery or charger because they keep giving me a new or refurbished phone of this same model i do not know much about cell phones other than there must be better ones than this,124,5
2206,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,make sure you read what the bluetooth profile is actually capable of doing for the carrier you are using for example verizon wireless i purchased this phone on line at almost no cost due to a promotion what i neglected to do is read the actual blue tooth profile the phone is capable of doing to much shock due to my ignorance my phone was actually crippled by my carrier with the exception of blue tooth wireless headsets anyway I am now on my 3rd phone and was upgraded to a motorola e815 i was constantly experiencing problems of unable to charge well at least after many trips to verizon wireless they at least took care of me it is amazing how many people have the same problem w / motorola phones i noticed this while waiting at the tech support counter for my address book to be transferred oh yeah forget the 12 megapixel camera it is truly crappy and worthless co-workers first impression of the phone is that it looks very cheap it is not all bad news however the phone has an additional memory slot for transflash card this is a wonderful feature if your computer is capable of handling transflash cards you can basically transfer your pictures videos and music files directly to you computer and vice versa at no additional monthly charge i love the speaker phone feature which i prefer over the blue tooth wireless headsets the alarm clock feature truly wakes me up in the morning as long as you program it with a truly absurd ring tone that is great news if you are travelling,266,6
2207,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had this phone for one year at the time i thought it was a great-looking phone with plenty of features after one year i still think it is a pretty decent phone but definitely not as attractive as some newer ones on the market i agree with other reviewers that the camera is not that great i guess on the plus-side the phone does hold a lot of the images similarly it holds a decent amount of ringtones and the ringer speaker is prety loud depending on the ringtone of course i do not use the bluetooth feature so i can not comment on it overall I am pleased with this phone at the time it was 100 or so which i think to be a fair price from my experience with this phone however i will next purchase something without an antenna this is in my opinion the biggest complaint i have as it looks and feels very cheap,158,7
2208,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i bought this phone with thoughts of a great camera and reliable phone i have yet to see either of them after the first month the internal screen went all white after a period of the phone sutting off randomly I am on my second phone the phone just seems very flimsy also the camera is absolutly the worst camera i have ever seen on a camera phone i know it is just a phone and not a digital camera but i would expect that pictures would be somewhat decent especially becuase this phone boasts a 12 megapixel camera very misleading this phone is soo bad i am contemplating paying the 175 cancellation fee and leaving verizon since the bastards will not let me switch models for the very highly rated slvr and cingular,131,8
2209,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i got this phone in june it worked great all summer and i snapped fairly decent shots with it then in october it decided it did not want to take half my calls and it did not store my pictures anymore so verizon gave me another v710 and it worked pretty well then in january my second v710 stopped saving pictures again so they gave me a third one if my phone stops working agian i will get down on my hands and knees and beg for a different model but besideds that the battery life is great i play games txt and talk all day and by the time i go to bed i still have full battery life,118,9
2210,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,this phone is pretty reliable and easy to use it has useful featueres such as bluetooth and a built in camera on occasion it needs to be turned off and on to communicate via bluetooth properly with other devices for example headset palm computer this phone does not support obex which means the phone can not sync contact lists with your computer or palm device the data transfer is 1xrtt and not evdo as in the e815 however unlike the motorola e815 it can use the analog network as well in case you are in a rural area or if the network is busy for example around new year or potentially some type of disaster the phone also has a convenient speakerphone feature two types of batteries are available in addition to the standard battery the extended battery which is twice as big requires that a larger battery door be placed on the phone overall i wish that they would have been a bit more careful with the software design but i would definitely buy the phone again,176,10
2211,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,my husband purchased 2 of these phones for each of us we have had for over a year and it constantly gives us problems the battery life is very short the battery on his phone lasts only a few hours and he does not even use it that much i have a problem with the bluetooth for my car lately the phone does not ring at all in the car so i miss all my calls this phone needs alot of improvement i only gave it 3 stars because verizon service is reliable the phone has many functions and it is easy to use but as far as reliable that it is not do not buy this phone not worth the money,119,11
2212,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,to start out i would like to say that this phone was a problem from the day i got it it is plagued with annoying bugs some pretty big the phone has terrible battery life of about 30 minutes of talk time and two days of standby time when i bought it i knew the battery was not great but i thought it would be better than what i am experiencing the phone periodically blacks out while you are doing the simplest things like browsing your contacts and photos which brings me to my next point the camera is absolutely horiffic in moderate to low light to get a halfway decent picture you must take photos outside in very good light also transfering photos and videos to your computer is a big pain because verizon crippled the bluetooth functionality only letting you use it for headsets now you must buy a 40 transflash card or email them to your computer for 025 / message it is latest problem of many is that it will not let me delete or transfer pictures to my memory card so i can not take anymore photos or even send them to anyone this phone does not even deserve one star update now it will not even charge and does not acknowledge a call update ii now the charger only works some of the time battery will not allow me to make a call for more than ten minutes and more I have had 2 motorola phones both have been the worst phones I have ever had,251,12
2213,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i purchased this phone just over a year ago and i have to say that it has served me well verizons network is extremely reliable i can not remember the number of times I have had service when friends of mine with other providers did not and they had to use my phone to make calls the pics are not great quality but that is what i own a camera for to take spur of the moment pics to send friends it is fine as far as the bluetooth issue goes it has not bothered me any because i do not have a need for it but it is something to consider the one complaint i do have and I am beginning to think this is a general motorola problem especially after reading some of the other reviews is the battery this is the second motorola I have purchased that after about 8 months to a year the battery loses charge after only a few hours even if the phone is not in use I am not sure if the problem lies in the battery or in the connection for the charger because i do notice sometimes my phone is plugged in and not actually charging i still prefer motorolas over other brands available because of the style and text messaging options but i would highly recommend purchasing the insurance for 5 bucks a month just in case unless you purchase the phone for less than the 50 dollar deductible,238,13
2214,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i am now on my second v710 the first one got wet and the screen went dead it seems that verizon and motorola have updated the v710 before they discontinued it and the phone is better than ever for the price amazoncom is offering this phone with the rebate you can not miss this opportunity i have never had a problem with using bluetooth on this phone and the picture quality is very good this is a great cellphone,78,14
2215,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,this is the phone that made verizon start telling you that they were crippling bluetooth they have settled a lawsuit and while the policy continues with newer phones bluetooth to headsets and such only not for file transfer to your palm or pc they would rather charge you send yourself pictures at least they tell you about it now,56,15
2216,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,overall this phone is great but it has it is flaws the reception is flat out amazing the camera stinks and many 1 megapixel cameras are better than this one the large screen is totally awesome and i really love that about the phone the lcd screen in the front is sufficient for a second screen overall i really love this phone even after 8 months of use the battery life is also great and i have never really run out of battery when i really needed it if you are looking for a fair-priced phone i really think you should look into the v710 i thought it was a great buy thanks for reading my review,116,16
2217,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,let me start by saying i love my phone that being said there are some features people may be looking for in a phone that it just does not have first it is bigger and heavier than any other camera phone you are going to find out there the picture quality is crap compared to other 1 megapixel camera phones also the camera does not have a flash it has a crappy light which is pretty much only good for finding your bluetooth it is definitely disabled i do not have any accessories but i do have bluetooth in my apple ibook i can make a 144 internet connection but that is it the phone does not work with isync and files can not be transfered via bluetooth there was a class action lawsuit over this and to be honest i will probably be getting a new phone soon if i can keep my v710 i will although because like i said i do love it,160,17
2218,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,generally this phone is fine the pics are awful that might need to be fixed although otherwise it is fairly easy to use,22,18
2219,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,the motorola v710 is an amazing piece of work to look at that is about it when the screen decides to work it awes greatand graphical display the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors I had rather be using a disposable then this the worst part about the phone by far is the charger i have to jiggle the cord around wrap it around objects then pray and sometimes it will work the sales reps spoke of it as if it were the second coming of jesus but they must have been lied to as well,102,19
2220,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,this is a great phone in terms of reception there are some design flaws if carrying the phone in a bag it is easy to inadvertently hit the record button or to lower the sound of the ringer there are limited ringers that come with the phone and it is difficult if not impossible to download ringers without buying verizons get it now package or hacking into the phone the camera is useless for indoor shots the bluetooth feature is only useful for a headset verizon has made it impossible to sync it with your computer it is a nice looking phone if a bit long the keyboard is odd you can list multiple numbers for each entry and that is a plus,122,20
2221,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i got this phone because it had the best reception reviews and was compatible with the best locally provider the reception is good which is why i got it so i do not really care that the camera is below mediocre the evil verizon disabled it is connectivity and the batterys only good for one day but it keeps losing audio when you try to make a call it is not a network issue it connects okay but neither party gets any sound i ordered two phones one was really bad so i exchanged it now the same s t is happening with the other original and the replacement it is possible that this is a verizon only issue their store tech support is absolute garbage although their telephone customer service people are models of polite helpfulness go figure and denied there was any problem because they could not reproduce it after a couple of test calls i give up i just want a reliable phone to make phone calls but it does not exist if you look at all phone reviews at least 1 in 8 is very negative no mfr has good quality control and the development outpaces testing just like microsoft the bane of my work life take home message never get a 2-year contract for any phone or any provider that way you can look forward to retrying the phone lottery in reasonable time,234,21
2222,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,the battery is not good actually is very short only last two days it is not consistent with it is ad,20,22
2223,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone about a month ago and found it is very good i like the camera and it can also record short video clips i bought a bluetooth headset for my v710 so that i can talk with hand free the main issue is about the voice dial when i try to call some of my friends with chinese or indian name it is really difficult to be recognized i have to try again and again to guess what the phone will pronounce them although the voice dial feature is non-specific person speech recognition so that we do not need to train the recognizor why not also proivdes some method for the user to hear the target name pronounciation in the other words if the user can not train the recognizer why not let the recognizer train the user i still have several friends which i do not know how my v710 will pronounce their names so that i can not call them by voice dial another issue is about the life of the battery it can only last two days after fully charged considering it has doublescreens i can somewhat accept this although it is really troublesome to charge the phone every two days,206,23
2224,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,verizon has disabled the bluetooth file transfer and the file transfer from transflash so you have to subscribe to their extra services over the cell network which they also charge for your airtime to transfer files and programs even mp3 music files totally defeats the purpose of buying this phone with bluetooth,52,24
2225,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,pros incredible reception crystal clear call quality 12 megapixel camera w / flash digital camcorder w / up to 3 minutes of video and sound sleek sexy executive look got to love that black over silver good speaker phone awesome voice recognition rock solid construction fully functional bluetooth w / alltel easy accessible menus perfect sized white lit smart keypad this thing actually senses ands turns off when there is enough light mp3 player and fm stereo headset beautiful doubledisplay internal / external with a total of six different colors also featuring a huge bright internal screen tons of preloaded wallpaper and screen savers too many features to name cons weak vibrate i assume this is to preserve battery life so so camera at night in night mode the camera takes mediocre pics even with the flash on it takes forever to configure the right setting so my suggestion is read the manual and play around and see what you can come up with a bit better than average battery life rated at 3 hours of talk time i highly recommend the extended life which lasts for about 5 1/2 hours surface scratches rather easily instruction manual is a little bit confusing in some aspects conclusion this is the best phone i have ever owned i would not own another phone,198,25
2226,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have been very impressed with this phone ever since i bought it a few months ago definitely worth getting paid 25 for pros reception / voice quality decent camera for the daytime it is a phone with a tiny appature not a 500 camera built like a rock i would have destroyed a lesser phone several times by now large external and internal display high quality internal lcd screen comfortable to hold transflash card slot quality voice recognition intuitive menus and feature layout cons foolish initial ringtones verizons greed crippled pic / mp3 xfer however this can be fixed heavy low capacity battery / short life battery indicator does not decrease linearly ok keypad,107,26
2227,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i have owned this phone since december 2004 while i do appreciate many of it is features this phone falls short on some very important basic functions 1 battery life as mentioned by many is terrible 2 the flimsy plug-in phone charger and where it connects into the phone is quite testy and i fear it is on it is way to failing completely when it does work it takes forever to charge 3 humidity severely affects this phone if hands are even slightly damp / sweaty or it is humid outside which is the case nearly all summer in new jersey the display turns off 4 this phone constantly turns itself all the way off and the only way to get it to turn back on is to remove the battery put it back in and hold the power button for about 15 seconds 5 motorolas instruction booklet for this phone is possibly the worst i have ever seen pathetic 6 i do not get great reception with this phone at all now this could be my carriers fault something that makes no sense having one of the largest carriers in the nation living in the most densely populated state in the nation and receiving such horrible service 7 i do not want a refurbished used phone when i go in for help either fix the phone i have or give me a new one with no problems i do not want a phone that already has problems because guaranteed they have not fixed the problem they just cleaned it up and put it in a new box these few things are enough for me to want to throw this motorola out the window and never look back these are basic issues and for the price the phone should work period overall disappointed,304,27
2228,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,ha just purchased it and now at verizon stores it is not available ne more so i guess this phone is obsolete now great phone although pros reception speaker phone white led lit colored keypad at night cons keypad very difficult to use at times feels like one layer of cheap plastic features are not all that great can not transfer mp3 via pc camera is ok looks really generic now people assumes it is just a 50 when it is not over all it is a great phone when used as a phone other than that features and what not does not seem to be as great as advertised,105,28
2229,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,was a little apprehensive reading some mixed reviews on this phone here glad i went ahead i switched from tmobile / sonyericsson t610 to verizon / motorola v710 what a world of difference if i had known earlier i would have left tmobile mid-way and paid the contract cancellation fee it is that significant not sure how much is the phone how much is the carrier but the whole experience has been transformed from an annoyance to a delight the keypad is fun to punch the speakerphone is loud and clear folks on the other end think i am in the same room and no dropped calls everywhere even insideetc can not comment about camera video web browsing and more had all of those in my previous phone too they are distractions at best much prefer my 7mp camera and my 15 laptop screen for those,142,29
2230,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,oh my god do not buy this phonei have gone through eight of these phones and they all have the same problems crappy camera freezing up texts will not send for several minutes will not charge half the time and the battery life sucksi had to charge it twice a day,41,30
2231,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,this phone has nice features a large screen a great speakerphone and a decently loud ringer the battery life is horrible although although maybe it should be expected because of the large screen size do not bother with this phone if you want the bluetooth capability because verizon disable all of useful bluetooth features leaving you with wireless headset only it is a nice phone but not worth the price,68,31
2232,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is a fantastic phone i just downloaded voice genesis email on it and it let us me reply to my emails by voice this is sooooooo cool it is fast and let us me access the various email accounts i have too much nicer phone than the pda / phones better connection anyways buy it download voice genesis on it and you will have a great phone that can work like a pda,68,32
2233,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i love the phone except either is the battery problem or that is the way of the battery even i fully charge for more than 3 hours fully charge it still did not last for a full day other than that it is a great phone,44,33
2234,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i received the phone very quickly and i just love it it does almost everything i love all the features and especially love all the rebates thanks,27,34
2235,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have previously owned the v400 v525 v600 and now the v710 i am definitely glad i switched this was the nicest and most reliable phone out of those my only complaint with these verizon phones is with the antenna size,41,35
2236,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,this is a great phone it is extremely clear when making calls and is has greatscreen a transflash slot and can play mp3s and movies converted in 3gp so why is it a four star because verizon crippled it is blue tooth capabilities do not expcept full bluetooth capabilites to work but this is still a really good phone,59,36
2237,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i use a cell phone well to make and receive calls i do not really care that much about the other features i want the calls to be clear quick and hands-free i chose the v710 because it was the only bluetooth option offered by verizon i did not want to tear up my brand new roadster to talk hands-free so the headset was the perfect alternative the phone paired with the motorola hs 850 makes for clear calls even with the top down i do not use the phone for business for an average walking / riding around cell phone user the v710 does work for me,101,37
2238,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i must say that this phone has a few negatives one the keypad two the outer rim of the keypad is very flimsy and three the camera will not work in lowlight situations now these are all worthwhile sacrifices to the current price of the phone 2500 after rebate however if you plan to buy this phone at retail price i would stray from thatget the lg vx7000 or vx8000 instead those are more solid phones btw the reception with verizon wireless and this phone is very clear and speaker phone works just fine it is been about two months since i have owned this phone and whenever i open or close the flip phone feature the sides rub against the bearings making an old door creaking sound and the area located above the camera lens the black part of the phone gets scratched after i open it because it rubs against something on the inside or the grey rubber part can anyone else comment or confirm these two problems on my phone that would be much appreciated,178,38
2239,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i have owned the v710 for about 7 weeks now and it works most of the time but i would be happier with less dropped calls better reception i would have especially been happier if the rep at verizon told me to wait a few weeks for the upgraded version the e815 which just came out last week it fixes the issue with the keyboard layout the speaker phone works better it has more ringtones and also more built-in memory and for those who want a better camera the e815 works better my girlfriend has the newer one and hers wins hands down and to top it off it is the same price on verizons website verizon will not do anything for me since it is past the 15 day trial period and from what i understand they do not care if i am happy or not just that they have me wrapped up in a 2 year plan with the sub-par phone if you are a techie geek like i am get the newer model you will be happier,176,39
2240,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is a mid-priced phone with solid features all-around including bluetooth good reception nice compact size and good battery life if you buy it with those expectations you will be very happy with it compared to the higher-end phones although it has some drawbacks I have had it for a few months pros reliable very good reception an improvement over prior phone from a couple years ago compact bluetooth works with headphones and car not with pda photos and movies these are just novelty features to me but they work I have sent little video clips I have taken to another phone kind of cute loud ringer web browsing cons web browsing is pretty slow and limited the organizer features are not great the add-on motorola tools software for connecting to outlook is kind of clunky the cons are relative to what you would get on a higher end more expensive phone like a microsoft win-ce enabled phone if you compare to similar price-point phones this one is a very good value,178,40
2241,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i got this phone after having used both a motorola v600 and v551 on cingular it is better than both verizon service in los angeles is much better than cingular for starters but the v710 is better than the other phones too first the screen is huge and bright better than the others and like the v551 but unlike the v600 when using the phone with a bluetooth headset the phone will ring in addition to the headset which is a huge plus the negatives the keypad is lousy the camera is lousy the external disply does not show the time when not lit and the phone is larger than the gsm models but those are all worthwhile sacrifices for better service and for all of the complaining about the crippled bluetooth it is not a big deal at all using mobile phonetools you can still sync your phonebook with outlook using bluetooth bluetooth headsets also work great the only bluetooth loss is the ability to transfer ringtones not such a big deal if you ask me this phone has just been replaced by the motorola e815 for the price difference I had get the v710 the newer one addresses all of the negatives mentioned but at a 125 price premium which just does not seem worth it and you loose analog in the new one which only matters if you travel in the middle of nowhere often at the end of the day if verizon has the best service in your area this phone is a steal at it is current price you can disregard all reviews older than feb 2005 since the phone had a lot of issues that were corrected with a revision around that date earpiece volume and more,287,41
2242,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,my title says it all i have been to three different verizon stores trying to get these items corrected but keep getting directed elsewhere when the phone works it is nice but half of the time my phone does not ring the ring is too soft even when set to loud and the battery life is bad,56,42
2243,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,caveat this phone is pretty good but verizon has limited the bluetooth capabilities to supporting a headset only in other words if you want to get a file ie photos addresses messages into or out of the phone you can not use bluetooth to transfer them to or from your computer you must either pay to e-mail them buy the software / usb cable or the extra memory card and card reader i would have returned the phone but i did not buy the bluetooth fob until after the trial period was over I have written to verizon but always get a corporate doublespeak letter in return and the problem remains,106,43
2244,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is the top-of-the-line there has so much to explore in this little phone and a ton of features this will take you hours to find all of the little offerings this phone packs great phone a,38,44
2245,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is great i think that sometimes what is supposed to be a forum for peoples opinions turns out to be the place where the people go that are frustrated with everything in life the phone works fine great features i do not know what some of these people are whining about customer service is second to none i have to say that i have never been treated so well as a customer than by verizonwireless for example my wife and i updated our phones via phone the first person i talked to was not really helping so the trick is call back it usually works the next person was soo nice she gave us the phones with an added discount for us she could sent them overnight and threw in an extra holster for each of us admittedly this was because the initial order had been stopped for some unknown reason so to make up for it the nice lady did all that now if you have dealt with any kind of business in the last 20 years you can count on one hand how many treat you well enough for you to remember am i right well we all they all make mistakes understanding that is the firstto becoming a much happier and more satisfied customer would not you agree anyway enough of the counseling for all the whiners out there the phone is great what do you want something that you can not possibly find wrong with it it will not happen adapt and overcome semper fi try to oysters matt,261,45
2246,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had the phone for about a month now i switched from tmobile with a sony ericsson phone to verizon because of coverage issues the v710 is not a bad phone but nothing mind blowing either the signal is pretty much always strong even compared to other verizon users the screen is bright and nice looking accessories are available and are not too expensive either expansion card are cheap picked a 256 mb for 30 it allows me to transfer ringtones and store mp3s and pictures bluetooth is indeed somewhat crippled but there are some bypass to bring them to the phone for free works pretty well with motorola bt headset clear signal and hopefully I shall get it to work with my pc bt adapter soon battery life with the factory battery blows you will get a day or two at most on a stock battery my t68 would last almost a freaking week the 1500ma extended battery will last 3 - 4 days which is a bit more acceptable but is bulkier than the factory unit still fit in the holster although which is nice i guess this is a trade-off for a nice and brighter screen phone size not the smallest form factor out there advantage is that the keys are easily accessible and you will not screw up dialing the number even while doing other stuff voice dialing one of the coolest feature no need to train your phone for every name in your contact list just speak it up and it will recognize and dial the name i love this feature more than anything even the razor does not have that bottom line the phone is not bad not sure it is worth 200 but around 150 after rebate is not a bad deal just make sure you pick a travel charger or car adapter,298,46
2247,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,so i switched from t-mobile to verizon and am quite happy with the signal and coverage verizon truly does have the best coverage around the san francisco bay area the motorola v-710 phone stood out as a sleak and sexy piece compared to all other phones that verizon carried it has an amazingscreen and fantastic reception if you are looking for a great phone with basic features i suggest you get it at this amazingly low price but i wanted something more bluetooth and freedom the v-710 really is verizons crippled bluetooth phone they have disabled all but 1 bluetooth feature you can not transfer images ringtones and more to your phone bluetooth feature can only be used for the hedset this really sucks also i was forced to purchase the extended battery because the 2screens at 65000 resoultion kills the available battery in under 15 hours the phone is heavy but that is normal for cdma it is also oversized to fit the screen and keys eventually you will get used to it there are pros and cons but overall i am happier now than i was with my sony ericcson t-610 running off t-mobile,197,47
2248,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,recently upgraded from the v265 and wish i had purchased this in the first place the 265 was a good phone but this phone has all the latest features including bt i resisted buying this phone due to the talk about limited bt functionality but realized it was just hype and i would not use anything more than the headset or car kit anyway beyond the features the quality of the phone take advantage of the great verizon network i have had a few carriers and verizon is the way to go not only is the quality much better but i actually pay less since most of my friends and contacts are on verizon and such a high percentage of my minutes are covered under in calling i take more advantage of this than i ever did rollover,138,48
2249,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,with a little more than two weeks my phone is dead with no apparent reason i only wanted to charge but then now it is completely dead i can not even power on the darn thing and with lousy verizon service you will be stuck like me please do not make the same mistake i made avoid this phone by any means especially if it is offered by verizon terrible terrible terrible there is no other way to describe how i feel i have never come across an electronic product that went dead after two weeks without any damage never in my life one other thing about verizon i went to one of the stores and this lady tried to give me a refurbished one but then guess what that phone did not turn on either i wasted good one hour and half and she said please bring the box with you and we will exchange with a new one today i found out that she thought i bought at one of retail verizon store so she can only give me a refurbished one what am i going to do with a refurbished one without any power on maybe they think i can just carry the dead cell phone to tell everyone how bad the phone is and how bad service I am getting anyway until i resolve my issue this is the most horrible experience i ever experienced with electronics i will never buy motorola and possibly avoid verizon but at this point i have no choice,253,49
2250,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is great and with great features the battery is long lasting the menu is just my other motorola so i di have no problem i think it is user friendly but you have to be able to spend some time with it i am very angry at verizon for blocking the bluetooh features this phone has great potential and we should be able to use them for me this phone is a great deal even by the price 7600 brand new i bought it direct from verizon the discount i got was due to my husbands corporate discount so in all i can not complain about the phone but i keep reccomending people not to hook up with verizon i am serving time with them for the next 2 years because i wanted this phone there is no free lunch,141,50
2251,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i had 2 phone for past 8 months here are some pros and cons cons i do not make that many call so my actual instrument usage is very limited insipte of that both of my phones have been replaced twice the buttons stops working the buttons are not very friendly you have to press really hard the phone stops to charge intermittently with it is original adaptors if there is even a little drizzle or hands are little bit wet the displays goes out camera is no where 1 mb pixel as claimed phone is really heavy bluetooth and memory card is locked pros reception is very good phone speaker is excellent battery life is okay,115,51
2252,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone 1 month ago i have used bluetooth service hands free jebra 250 bluetooth device these are my observations i have not used camera but it is nothing special pros 1 good battery life 2 excellent call quality i use verizon 3 excellent speaker phone 4 excellent lcd screen cons 1 bulky bulky my biggest complaint 2 contact entry if you want to enter 3 different phone for a single person that person will show up 3 times in ur contact list which is not good i think they made like this to provide voice recognizition system 3 voice recognizition system sucks needs lot of improvement even after training with my words so this purchase is a trade off between nice features and bulkiness at the of the day i bought cdma 9810 audio vox which is sucks no question about it i returned it and bought motorola 710 i used cdma 9800 audiovox earlier which was good i liked it cdma 9800 is better than 9810 which is higher version 9800 which is quite surprising they just added few feautres i can not cdma 9800 9810 of audivox with motrola 710 as 710 out weighs the other two in many aspects even although audiovox beats motorola in terms bulkiness i hope this helps u guys,224,52
2253,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i recently switched from to verizon and purchased this phone and i was a little disappointed with some of the features for example the memory slot is great but you can not transfer any mp3 on there from your home pc and use them as ring tones the phone comes with 2 mp3 ringtones but verizon will not let you download mp3s you can only download cdma purevoice so if we were planning on using mp3 ring tones with verizon do not waste your money on this phone motorola did not put all of thier best features on this phone i used to own a motorola i95 which you could list multiple phones numbers home work cellfor a single contact with this phone you have to make a new contact entry for each phone number even if it is for the same contact does anyone know why motorola is goind backwards the camera is ok and does not give you the picture quality a 12 megapixel should that being said the quality of service is very good I have had the phone for about a month now and only had 1 call where i was hearing echos i have not had any calls rejected because the network was busy unlike the 2 a week i had with nextel,213,53
2254,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i switched from t-mobile to verizon because i wanted to have good reception both at home and work in addition to being able to use my phone on the metro indeed i am happy with it which is the point of owning a cell phone-being able to make and receive calls when we want my husband actually has the same phone which he has had since last november after comparing these two identical phones we have noticed that the one i have takes better digital pictures and the battery lasts longer before i need to charge it overall i am happy with this phone it is great,107,54
2255,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i noticed everything fine with this piece except the battery life the battery life is around 120 to 130 minutes rather than what it is said the piece is good otherwise,31,55
2256,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,i went through three or four motorola 270-cs waiting for a new cdma verizon bluetooth-enabled phone to come out i bought this one as far as phones go there has not much to complain about motorola makes a great phone the v710 has the best reception and sound quality I have found in a cell phone that being said I am sure the reason this high-end phone is now inexpensive is verizons miscalculation when they disabled most of the v710s bluetooth capabilities currently there has a lawsuit pending against verizon for this very reason i see verizon is now giving away a free bluetooth headset with the v710 to make you focus on what their bluetooth will do because it will not obex object transfer or much else and if you want a ringtone or music or anything on this phone you have to buy it now from verizon not me ever verizon we are always working for profit,152,56
2257,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this phone was rushed to production thus passing on the lack of quality to the consumer it is poor design starts from the continuation of an inadequately designed charging system that is extremely susceptible to debris wear and ultimately failure the main screen was permanently scratched within the first week because of the incorrectly sized keypad buttons every time the phone is open / closed it scratches the screen and then the exterior black top hinge the screen soon becomes an incredible hindrance to view the contents of the phone the blue tooth does not work with a power book what has point really yah you can use a cordless headset but after that there has not much use for it the camera is cocked at a funny angle supposedly moto will fix this but have they communicated that with any consumer nope advantages it does store your last 60 dialed and received calls the speaker phone is convenient but still lacking the user interface is well thought out but it should be it is from moto and they have been doing this since the beginning currently my phone has been sent in for repair because it does not charge at all even after multiple batteries and chargers the screen is scratched to oblivion do not believe the hype moto severely jumped the gun on this one do not buy this phone and let the buck be passed to you,230,57
2258,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have had my motorola v710 for approximately 5 months now and it does everything i want it to and more i listen to my mp3s on at all the time plus i can take pictures and store them on my trans flash card which i have seen raging in price from 1999 up to 3499 the pictures look great not a fan of the video feature although if you are technically challenged do not buy i would suggest this phone to people who can have a minute extra time to figure it out and does not need the whole thing spelt out for them great phone,106,58
2259,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,first the cons the camera is not what i was expecting i did not expect ansel adams quality but it is not what i get from my old 1 mp camera either but it is useful for taking snapshots the video is pretty useless as well the fact that verizon forces you to pay to send these crappy videos and photos makes sure that you will never use the camera see more below a bit spotty for mac osx users verizons software update further cripples phones usability greedy bastages pros great sound although you have to remember to keep the speaker over your ear truly great speakerphone I have had friends have nothat i was on a cell much less a speakerphone i think that between the speakerphone and the bluetooth headset moto actually almost meant for you not to use the handset in the conventional way mp3s as ringtones are fun but you have to work around verizon to do it copy them to the optional transflash card from your computer then to the phone seems to have great signal strength at least here in la i have very few drop-outs in areas that my old v8160 was really reaching for a signalscreen is gorgeous inside very nice outside bluetooth headsets are a godsend i can dial talk and hang up merely by touching my right ear general even with verizon trying to wrestle the last quarter out of your pocket it is a great phone if you get one with the earlier software you can get around verizon by using the translash card and a card reader to transfer images and mp3s to and from your computer I have heard that the later software removes some of that functionality which is why i am not flashing my phone,296,59
2260,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,i am extremely disappointed in this phone only because of verizon and how they have disabled the many features that this phone has to offer my boyfriend and i brought this phone roughly 30 days apart only to find that the software on his allowed him to download ringtones pictures and more utilizing a transfash well i went out and purchased a transflash as well but quickly found out that i could not transfer the files to the new software that is now installed on my phone bottom line is if you have the older software you can enjoy this v710 but if you have the newer software forget it i wish that as a consumer there is something that we can do about this misleading options on this phone i only wish i could return the phone i truly do not think that what verizon has done is legal if anyone has figured out a way to get around their many disabled features please let me know,165,60
2261,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i did some research before buying this phone and i found out that to use a lot of the phones features you will end up shelling out way too much money to verizon they disable the motorola-built features and replace them with customized features that they charge you for every time they are used the phone itself is an unbelievable piece of technology but has been crippled by verizon,70,61
2262,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i bought this phone based on published features just to find out verizon disabled some of these i can not understand a company who has so much going for them coverage clarity would risk upsetting their customer base verizon could gain so much more by giving us access to the technology and making their services very affordable so more people would sign up for them instead of disabling features and choosing to nickel and diming us to death instead verizon are you listening shame on you you should fire the guy who made that decision i like your service but i hope you loose to motorola that was underhanded i want my bluetooth multimedia / data transfer back,115,62
2263,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,if you need the best reception possible the v710 is a great choice i bought this phone because my lg vx6000 also verizon could not hold a call for more than 30 seconds in my office i liked my lg and it worked great most everywhere else but i was hoping to get a phone that i could at least hold brief conversations with in my office without constant dropped calls well i have used the v710 for several hours now in my office without a single dropped call if it had better battery life i would easily give it 5 stars great phone,104,63
2264,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is incredibly user friendly picture of person calling appears next to their name if you store them next to phone no speaker phone is also a nice feature,30,64
2265,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i am writing this review because i noticed that lots of people here have given negative and bad reviews on this product i have been owning the v710 since february this year and so far i have not seen anything wrong with it i also use a bluetooth headset logitech and it is been a perfect gadget from what others say i guess there could have been few phones that had problems and was not recalled by motorola otherwise i have had no problems and before i bought i did a qucik survey of people owning this and they all gave me great feedback,102,65
2266,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,I have had this for about a month and find it to be incredibly frustrating annoying and difficult to use so much so that i was compelled to write this review the software is the main problem from not being able to select individual phonebook info from received / dialed calls to the default loud setting when plugged in this phone has me pining for my old non-camera lg it even alerts me that i have a missed call after I have checked voicemail for that missed call thanks that is if i can feel the feeble vibration when set to vibrate and after a month the phone feels like it is about to fall apart i should have taken the hint from the keyboard on the display model which was completely destroyed i bought this because of the tri-mode capabilities and it was the only one available at the time if I have missed something in the directions and any of this needs to be corrected i will gladly recind or edit this review until then I am stuck with my first and last motorola,180,66
2267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,I have owned this cell for about 9 months so far in that time I have exchanged it 4 times the first 3 had to be exchanged for software issues the 4th time something wacky happened when i used it with my ibook and i did not disconnect it properly i went back and verizon gave me a refurbished model like the other 3 times this cell will not do any file transfering by bt so that is a huge downfall it is almost useless since this was the only verizon bt cell i bought it but in the end i wish i did not the cell got a huge hype and it was all for nothing camera is useless as it takes sub-par pics I have seen samsungs do better than this the screen however is nice and crisp i also noticed that the cell scuffs really bad at the high points where it opens / closes but there is nothing you can do about that since you got to open and close it i think motorola missed the mark on this model overall it is a decent cell but do not expect it to do much for the money it is not worth it i wished i had waited oh well at least it is decent,208,67
2268,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,folks i have discovered a fly in the ointment so to speak if you click on all the names of the glowing reviewers here you will find that practically each and every one of them has only written one review that one review is on the v710 each bogus review has a nickname attached perhaps this person is a motorola employee trying to boost sales or a person who can not deal with the real life negative reviews of this product but be warned and alerted the not so glowing reviews are probably the ones you should take as legitimate now onward to the phone review i have owned about five or six cell phones over the past three years and the v710 is the worst i was drawn to the rebates and low price which basically got me in trouble from the get-go the phone has terrible battery life it is difficult to operate it is clunky and large the sound quality is poor there are hardly any ringtones on it and the button keys are flat and hard to press in short a piece of techno-junk,186,68
2269,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this phone is awesome those of you that do not like this phone for one reason or another i would have to say that you do not have a clue what this phone can do this phone does it all with a 128 or a 256 mb trans flash card you can store tonz of photos even photo that you take with your normal digital camera and the the phones camera you can store them on there you can put mp3s on there and listen to them through the external speaker or get some headphones the best part is with the right software you can put full length movies on there and yes the quality is good granted it is not hd quality but it is a phone most people ask when am i ever going to watch a 2 hour movie on my phone and your right you probably will not but you can put all of the cool / funny little clips that are all over the internet on there and those make for a good laugh when your bored or something those who have this phone and do not like it all you have to do is search a little bit and you will love this phone this phone is the best phone I have ever had the voice reginition is awesome the speakerphone is awesome the whole phone is awesome,225,69
2270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,generally i do not do reviews but i thought this phone was getting an unjust bad reputation my last phone was an samsung n400 on sprint and it was bad battery died in a day and lots of dropped calls so my my criteria were good battery life great reception and speakerphone basically i wanted a good phone that would always be available to use it has excelled in all areas 0 dropped calls have yet to have 0 bars battery can go several days without a charge and the speaker phone is the best I have ever seen pros signal strength great sound quality superior speaker phone good battery nice lcds and over all good looks cons keypad leaves much to be desired but I am getting used to it camera is so-so at best bluetooth no intention of using it so i wish i could have saved some cash and got one without it,154,70
2271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,poor build quality battery life and there are no games included warning do not buyand battery life is even worse when you use the bluetooth i even bought the extended battery still very miner improvement if you want a quality phone buy the samsung a670,45,71
2272,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,does anyone know if you can buy this phone at the discounted price if you already have verizons service and you just want to upgrade your phone i can not seem to find this option when i try to buy this thanks,41,72
2273,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i do not normally do these types of things but you people are completely wrong you can have multiple numbers for one contact and only have the name listed once in the phone book for those of you who can not read the manual heres how hit contacts then hit the menu button scroll down to setup click that then hit view select primary contacts then hit done what do you know people with more than one number are only listed once this is what the little book that comes with the phone is for read it as a phone the v710 is amazing we all knew about the crippled bluetooth when we bought it thank verizon for that if you do not like it 175etf and you are free to do what you want you are not stuck with anything my battery will last 3 - 4 days with my normal useage if your battery is that bad take it back to the store and get a new one the camera takes decent pictures for a phone if you are using the picture on your phone change the resultion of the camera to 320x240 if you are going to put the photo on the computer use 1280x960 it will look good once you get it on the computer stop giving wrong information and read the phones manual remember it is a cell phone first and everything else second,233,73
2274,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,1 not performing to specifications battery life is very bad and charging the phone takes time this phone does not really last more than 15 days poor design for battery swapping swapping battery is not an easy job the cover needs to be removed and often gets stuck i do not know why i had to remove the antenna to remove the cover i had to pry the battery to get it out replacing the battery is also an issue i need to line it up perfectly i found out the first time i installed the battery the cover snapped back ok and the phone worked but it would not charge so swapping batteries is not a solution for the battery life issue 2 not performing to specifications camera takes poor pictures based on specifications and comparing to other cell phones that are less epensive 3 poor user interface design for the phone book due to the display of multiple entries for cell home office fax and more with the same contact name,170,74
2275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,this is the best phone from verizon if you are stuck with verizon wireless this is the best deal use it as mp3 player in the gym ability to use mp3 ringtones is a great fun great voice dial very dependable as a phone excellent reception no dropped calls good sound exceptional speakerphone I had give it 48 instead of 5 because of crappy camera do not care much about that,69,75
2276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I am sad that people are not happy with this phone I have had excellent reception battery life is awesome it comes with cool rings and it is not so small that i lose it in my purse i think this is a great phone,41,76
2277,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,oh man this is the worst phone I have ever owned i had it for just a few days and immediately sent it back why well for starters the digital camera is the worst I have ever seen on any phone the pictures look like some piece of junk from the 70s secondly the phone is fat it is just way too big and bulky the antenna sticks out too far even when it is not pulled out finally the screen resolution is not very crisp and sometimes the phone lags yes i mean actually lags like a slow computer I have had another motorola phone that did this as well if you want a fancy phone and are shopping for service providers let me suggest the audiovox cdm-8940 from verizon i just got it and it is 10 times better no i do not work for verizon,139,77
2278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,bluetooth is awsome lots of cool features great reception and navigation through the menus is very easy the speaker phone is very good sounds good and loud some things that bug me are you can not change the outside screen to blink or light up when it rings camera they call it the 1st mega pixel in a phone I have had much better camera phones before but still it is ok there are no games unless you purchase them and most are monthly subscription games all in all the best phone I have ever had and the service verizon is great and I have tried them all and in this area eastern long island nothing comes close to verizons coverage,116,78
2279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i bought this phone the day it was released which coincided with my verizon contract expiration and free phone period after allowing myself to be seduced by the pre-release hype as about everybody knows by now the device is seriosly crippled by verizon as a telephone it is pretty good although there are undoubtedly others that perform as well and can be got for a quarter the price the absence of fully functional bluetooth however overrides the features that made it desirable in the first place and verizons attitude towards it is early adopters have me seriously considering another carrier the next time I am due to re-up,105,79
2280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,it might be because i have no intention of using bluetooth to transfer data i bought a transflash 128 mb card with sd adapter for 31 on ebay but i received this phone today and it has done very well calls are clear even from my basement which normally has very bad reception the camera is very good in bright light and how the pics turn out depends on how steady your hand is the video capture is also cool as long as you do not move the camera too quickly while shooting the screen is also worth pointing out it is very very clear and bright and huge too looks-wise the v710 is much cooler than almost all other cellies out there the razr might be cooler looking but the v710 has more features since I have only had the phone for one day i still have not figured out most of the features but maybe it is because i have not read the book-sized manual yet i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new celly especially since it is free i looked at it at best buy and it was 220 with a 40 month plan on amazon it is cheaper to begin with and then they threw in an extra 150 dollar rebate you can also choose the cheapest plan they offer and still qualify for the rebate i do not plan on using more than 300 daytime minutes per month so i went for the 30 dollar plan i hope I have made it clear that if you do not plan on using bluetooth for other things than wireless accessories this phone is perfect for you,275,80
2281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,just got it 2 days ago it took me a long to finalize this phone as everyone had mostly negative reviews here in amazon on cnet and more well the camera is not that bad it is as good as what you should expect from a cell then the voice quality is superb and it is so loud and clear you will love it the reception is great everywhere i guess this is the only bluetooth only voice choice from verizon and it has all other features of speaker phone and so on i guess it is a nice choice kaushal,95,81
2282,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,i bought this for the bluetooth connectivity to my totota prius navigation system i connected well but when i wanted to move my phone book from the phone to the prius system it would not work i took it to the local verizon wirelees tech support guy and he said that verizon had disabled the ability of the phone to transfer the phone book the prius system and most nav systems only let you enter new phone s and more from the phone not the screen i returned the phone this is verizons problem not motorolas,95,82
2283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,I have had the phone for 4 months now this phone has great reception my friend has a kyosera slider and i always get extra bar camera only works in daylight you need trans flash card tomidi / mp3 ringtones but the sound is great i did invest into the usb cable and motorola sync software now I am able to sych my outlook contacts with the phone calendar sync is the possibility as well but i do not use it the holster is cheap and cracked pretty soon had to go and get a bodyglove case which is quite good battery life is ok i get 2 - 3 days out of it with light use,115,83
2284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,this is supposed to be the only non-pda bluetooth phone by verizon i had to get this phone as i was limited to verizon service other carriers were not working well in my area pros saves last 60 calls dialed and received gr8 screen signal bluetooth cons bulky the antenna gets stuck everytime in my trouser pocket bluetooth probably works i have not tried yet but what sucks is verizons effort to make money everyway and not let bluetooth be used as the user wants the outside display gets blackened out and u have to press the button to see the time not too many ring tones games and more,107,84
2285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,i have only had this phone for a day most of the complaints i have heard from people are over exaggerated for example it is possible to only show a persons primary line although it is not the default for the phone it is possible to personalize the phonebook i also liked the custimization that can be done to this phone do not like pressing the upper right hand key to go to your phonebook you can change it so a different key will do it i have not really tried out the bluetooth and the camera is not all that great but for me there is not really any need for either of these features otherwise everything has been great,116,85
2286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i agree that the lack of full bluetooth support is rather lame beyond that although the phone is wonderful great reception great screen mp3 ringtones camera works just fine as long as there is enough light natural light works best it is a phone not a camera keep that in mind,47,86
2287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this phone has a mediocre user interface virtually featureless bluetooth and horrible phonebook / contact management first the user interface it is ok it is nice that it allows the ability to customize which options are displayed and in what order they appear on the home page of the phone unfortunately that along with the 12 megapixel camera are the only good things i have found with this phone second the bluetooth this phone does not allow copying items to / from the phone using a bluetooth compatible computer and does not allow emailing of photos so there is no way to get the photos to your computer and there is no way to perform contact / address book sync with a computer or handheld device pda also no calendar sync third there is no way to have a single phonebook entry person containing multiple phone numbers each phone number occupies a line in the phone book so needless to say the phonebook list is way longer than it needs to be very few people that i contact frequently have only 1 phone number i think my grandma is the only person i know that has only 1 phone number it is not a bad phone otherwise maybe I have just come to expect more from a cell phone for example my less expensive sony ericsson t610 had full bluetooth addressbook / calendar sync a more neatly organized phonebook although took slightly lower quality pictures but it remiscent aside from the nicer screen / graphics and camera of an old circa 1999 nokia i had although waaaaayy more expensive,255,87
2288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,2.0,negative,this phone is great i love it but verizon crippled it they disabled object transfer over bluetooth so you will not be able to get pictures off your phone put mp3s onto your phone or download your contact list withouth buying a transflash card and reader this is something verizon did because profit is their middle name they want you to pay 25 / picture to send them to yourself they want you to buy their ringtones through get it now other than this problem the phone is great pictures are a bit grainy and dark but they are as good as can be expected from a phone the form factor is a bit bigger than expected but the screen is absolutely huge for more info about this phone there is a user community at [ ] it is under the verizon heading,141,88
2289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,have had this phone for a couple of weeks traded up from a t720i a great improvement much more usable the screen resolution is just awesome menus and get it now features are much faster i have been using a sandisk 128 mb transflash and usb reader to transfer images and ringtones / mp3s with no problems you can fit a ton of pictures / mp3s on that card you do have to copy any audio files from the card over to the phone memory to use as a ringotne there is a ton of free audio editing software out there to create and edit your own ringtones this is a good way to get around verizons pay-for-pictures / ringtones junk buttons have a nice solid feel speaker phone is loud and voice dialing works very well i had some trouble with the unit turning off unexpectedly but has not happened since i fully charged the battery i have not used bluetooth yet and do not plan to camera is decent for a phone video is pretty choppy all of the applications i have downloaded look great on the display,182,89
2290,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,do not buy this phone this phone is great in terms of rf and use but that is about it everything you would expect from motorola such as camera and bluetooth have been crippled severly you can even use bt to transfer pics or mp3s you have to flash the phone for it to work which is a pain verizon has crippled this phone by disabling other features like multimedia function from their program mobile phone tools so the only way is to use their expensive get it now program stay away do not get this phone til they fix it in the future,102,90
2291,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,i purchased the phone because of the bluetooth technology this technology has been mostly disabled by verizon do not buy if you plan to use this phone with bluetooth very disappointed will sell shares of motorola and verizon as only recourse burned once never again,45,91
2292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this is the buggiest phone i have ever used it has all sorts of problems with bluetooth integration to the acura handsfee link system also verizon has crippled the phone so that you can not transfer files using bluetooth to force you to use their get it now service which is much much slower in addition to the fact that you have to pay for it finally the camera is aweful I have seen better pictures from cheap 640x480 cameras and do not even try to take a picture indoors i am very disappointed that this is the best verizon can come out with in a bluetooth handset why pay hundreds of dollars for this when you can get a better bluetooth phone for use on the cingular network for 50,128,92
2293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,but verizon only had this for the bluetooth i got it when it came out and i was extremely pissed off for a month i could take the lousiest pictures that i have ever seen it was like you pause your vcr on a horribly recorded tape i had another phone before this with at t for over a year and that was not a megapixel but 640x400 well it was less resolution but each picture came out 1000 times better in light and otherwise even outside the fotos come out very bad put it this way i never use the camera anymore even when i say i wish a had a camera to take a funny foto of someone it is a bluetooth enabled phone which works so so with the 820 motorola headset i do not think you should buy this if you need a camera phone only if you need a bluetooth phone with verizon if there are none others around very dissapointed with the motorolla phone it was my first and ia had heard many good things about it which this phone made me forget them and just think of the horrible quality of this phone oh and i heard that there is or was a recall on the first wave of these phones on the camera lens i returned it and i got another replaced for free at least i made motorolla pay for it is crappy phone they put out there and it is quite big for phones out there which are getting smaller every day the v600 is much better and a bit smaller if they had it for verizon i would have gotten it in a heartbeat,280,93
2294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,this v710 phone has had terrible reviews because of it is many bad features and numerous problems verizon will be releasing motorolas new evdo e815 phone to replace this phone very soon i urge people not to buy this v710 phone anymore and wait for the new replacement the e815 looks very similar but has an improved keypad better bluetooth capability better quality camera and a new version of the speech recognition software the e815 has been previewed at this months ces electronics expo in las vegas with great reviews here is something you can read [ ] verizon is expected to release the e815 by may 2005,106,94
2295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,i was a bit iffy at first after reading all of the reviews here but being that this was the only bluetooth phone verizon offered i gave it a try it is an awesome phone speakerphone works great the volume can go painstakingly high as well as low voice dialing is awesome because it recognizes your command without any programming and if you have an accent or whatever can adjust and adapt can also dial by speaking digits aloud i admit the camera by itself does a rather poor job for the 12 megapixel rating so minus a star for that the video shooting mode is pretty cool records sound too for the individual above who could not see more than three names in the contacts list he must have not read the manual as you can put it into list mode and see much more the display is excellent and razor sharp the sound clarity is great and paired with the motorola hs810 bluetooth headset is a killer combo with voice dial you have no need to ever touch the phone which is always in my bag a great phone if you want a digital camera go buy one if you want a good phone here it is as a side note i did not purchase the phone from amazon i bought through verizon as part of an upgrade but bought for same price,234,95
2296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,4.0,positive,the v710 alone provides better speaker phone quality especially to the other end than in conjunction with the hf600 get a simpler charging adapter for the car and something to attach the phone to the dash transflash memory add-on works ok motorola mobile phone tools 30 is problematic it would be nice to know about alternatives to sync outlook how another reviewer moved stuff via the flash memory option it works better as a speaker phone than as a non-speaker phone it seems to be a little quiet when held to the ear compared to other phones but there must be something that can really pump up the volume since the speaker phone is so good the obvious stuff is good if you look at the phone in the store yourself display quality call quality analog backup to digital service have not done much with the camera but I am starting to think that with the way most people treat their phones how is the lens supposed to stay clean and not blur or otherwise hinder images it may really only be good to have for impromptu photos think about are separate pda and phone better even if it means 2 devices instead of 1 the pda vendors have more of a track record with hooking up to the pc are separate camera and phone better for most pictures the camera vendors that made film in addition to digital cameras have a history and prices are plumetting and megapixels and features rising,253,96
2665,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,motorola h500 bluetooth headset review headset used with t-mobile sda and now the t-mobile dash pros easy to pair good sound quality inbound and outbound easy to use quickly connects to phone to answer or make calls cons with glasses it gets loose around the ear and feels like it is flopping around most of the time i can fix it by wedging the headset around the ear before i place my glasses on do not put it in your pocket when the headset is on I have made so many involuntary phone calls it is annoying i even turn it off but most of the time when i sit down the pant pocket fabric pushes on the on / off button and it is on i wish they would recess the on / off buttons to avoid this battery life it claims to have 8 hours but I am not sure I am getting that the battery seems to die much sooner than 8 hours although this is not based on a real test I am comparing it to my previous jabra which could go for days without a charge this one is charged at least every 2 - 3 days i also turn it off every night and during the day to avoid the involuntary calls altough it still happens hope this helps gp,212,0
2666,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,it seems really strange that so many people had such a hard time with this product i purchased one of these for 70 6 months ago along with my verizon / motorolla razor phone and it is works great the set up is extremely easy and turning the phone on and off is extremely simple one button for those who said this is the picture of the h700 i can tell you right now that my h500 it has this name on the packaging and when i connect it to my phone is the exact same model as picturedbuttons and all the only thing i have to say is that the range may be considered short to some people i mainly use it while walking or in my room while I am doing paper work so it is never farther than 20 feet from the phone when you get about 25 ft or farther the voice quality becomes a little distorted and gets worse the farther you are the simple solution to this is to keep the phone in the room you are in or an adjacent one I have had this headset for half a year now and it is never given me any problems it has a very nice stand-by feature that conserves the battery when not in use and the battery life seems to be 2 - 3 times that of my phone the quality of sound is great I am a music student and often play new piano pieces I have written over the phone to friends and family and they never had a problem hearing the full range of notes clearly it is been the perfect headset for my needs the only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the range which is not an issue at all for myself although others may want a longer range,300,1

2668,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i was really excited to get a bluetooth headset for use with my new lg8300 unfortunately while i can hear everyone just fine my callers say they hear terrible distortion deep echoing and generally very poor call quality people have asked me to not call them on this headset it is really too bad with all of the hype and extra selling of bluetooth accessories so this was a wasted purchase as far as i am concerned I am not sure what the other two reviewers were saying but my h500 is exactly like the picture grade a for style grade d for utility,102,3
2669,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the h500 works well with my razr v3 but i can not seem to figure out how to use it with my hp l2000 notebook a connection is established but i do not hear a sound and my voice does not register in the microphone need help on this any takers please thanks,50,4

2671,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the picture on theis that of a h700 i have called amazon a couple of times about this and they have no clue about this they have even said a week back that they will be changing this in their catalog but no changes yet someone from amazons team please care to update me i had to purchase another more expensive headset because i was not sure what i would get well they did say that i was not going to get the headset featured in the picture for sure,90,6

2675,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,shipped fast and nice price but no one can hear me on the thing very well surprising for an oem motorola device oh well it works well enough for what i bought it for answering the phone while I am driving or working and telling whoevers calling to leave me alone laughing out loud,51,10

2682,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,although not the best and not the worst bt headset it worked often times it sounded as if the caller was speaking through foam with a low audible hiss the caller on the other ended heard us fine sometimes they said we sounded far away I have used multiple bt headsets thus the average score it works not the greatest clarity but not the worst,65,17
2683,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this headset does not even go into your ear fully which makes it hard to hear spend a little extra and get a jarba,23,18
2684,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is the only bluetooth i use it has the most comfortable and accessible device that does not rub my ear the wrong way one touch access calling and a host of other features has kept me with the motorola series on this design for several years have tried many but they bug me no end they either hurt my ear or they do not fit worth a flit d r raggy ragsdale,74,19

2688,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i went with the h500 rather than the h350 as i thought it was newer and the speaking might be picked up better it is actually raspy to listen on and my recepients say they are having trouble picking up my voice garbled and going in a out,48,23

2694,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this is not my first time owning a motorola bluetooth it is my favorite one the thing is it is not being sold in store anymore hence my purchase online when i ordered thisthe description said new however when i got it i noticed that theon it was faded and there was a scratch on it I have already contacted the seller and I am just waiting for a resolution I shall update my review once i have a resolution aside from the cosmetic flaws the bluetooth works fine it is clear and very easy to set up I am hoping i can get it replaced with a new one like i ordered update 12/28/12 hey kim we apologize for the inconvenience but it seems that we have just ran out stock in those new we can offer you a partial refund for your troubles please let us know what you rather do jayden when i placed my order it said new and they send me a used one their response is they have run out of new ones really then they are talking about giving me a partial refund unacceptable first and last time I shall order from this seller like i stated before the bluetooth works it is just used and that is not what i paid for my rating has nothing to do with the product it is all about the seller and the shady way they are trying to conduct business you can not advertise a product as new and ship something that is clearly used i understand that there are used products in like new condition or good condition however this was not the case you purchased 1 of motorola h500 bluetooth wireless headset soft black new,286,29
2695,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like everything in this bluetooth but it would have been perfect if apart of having a voice command asking you what number you want to call it would have a voice command telling you who is calling everything else is very good good volume clarity and reception,48,30
2696,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the bluetooth dose not connect to the phone when it should it takes too long for to connet so in my mind it is a piece of junk,28,31
2697,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,with this headset all you could hear was static never even the sound of a voice was disapointed in the product from the beginning the packaging was just the headset charger and instructions wrapped in plastic wrap just received the headset back from my son in law and am returning it,51,32
2698,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i used to have a motorola h500 which worked well for my phone unfortunately i misplaced it so i eventually bought another one via amazon when i got it it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound i thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away it did not this was suppose to be a brand new headset it is defective and i did not return it immediately so I am giving this supplier a 1 star,80,33
2699,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i had boughten this as a presnt to mymother because she was always on the phone due to work she loved it at first it was very simple to connect to your phone but when we went to try it out it did not work as well as i had hoped i had called her from the home phone and there was mainly just a lot of static i could here her but not very well when she had handed me the bluetooth headset i could hear very well but the other person on the other end of the phone line heard the same static i had previously we are still trying to fix it and might end up sending it back,123,34
2700,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,one seems to want a charge often but they both work with the phones well since they are for driving laws very suitable,21,35
2701,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,ordered this and loved it used it so much that i have already wore it out found another and purchased it,21,36
2702,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,works as intended but the volume is absolutely too soft to use in the car / noisy environment i find myself holding the bluetooth to up the volume which defeats the purpose of a headset in general I had advise going with something in-ear,41,37
2703,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought the h350 which works great but i found another place that sells it for a much lower price and free shippingis nice although,27,38
2704,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i have been using motorola blueteeth for some time now i prefer the kind that have the flip mic boom that automatically turns off the headset when closed for soooo many reasons however i kept having issues with the mic eventually ceasing to work at all i could hear the other person but they could not hear me at all i had one headset replaced on warranty but after the warranty ended on that headset it too ceased to work one day so i decided to try this headset the motorola h500 for the most part i can hear the person on the other end of the line just fine although i will admit that sometimes having the phone in a pocket is a bit more of a problem that it has been with other products however i get almost unanimous complaints about the quality of my voice to the recipient at the other end it works and is tolerable to some people who get used to it but i have almost had to stop using the headset so that people can understand me obviously this kind of defeats the purpose of having a headset the other major issue i have with this headset is that even if i turn it off before putting it in my pocket it will often press against something in my pocket long enough to turn itself on and the proceed to call someone unbeknownst to me with the flip boom this was not an issue but it is something to keep in mind with this model i plan to speak to motorola in the next day or two about the microphone audio quality maybe i just got a lemon but other than the eventual end of the microphone i much prefer the h810,299,39
2705,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have owned several bluetooth ear pieces over the years all different price range and brands first of all there is no point in buying any brand other than motorola none of the others regardless of price measure up secondly there is no point in buying anywhere but amazon no one not radio shack best buy office depot or any other chain comes close to the price available at amazoncom now for the h500 it is as good as the h800 i owned that died in a house flood and much more aesthetic than lower priced models it was easy to pair with my blackberry and like all motorola models is extremely simple to use if you want a medium priced well functioning easy to use bluetooth headset this is the one to buy,134,40
2706,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,it works took me a little bit to figure out how to fit it on my ear but once i got that down no problem,26,41
2707,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i would not buy this product again it does work although but with your handset in your pocket things start to get scratchy pay a few more bucks and get a 700 series,33,42
2708,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,ordered thison the suggestion of a friend he was very right it works great and is very comfortable to wear,22,43
2709,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i liked it so far i did nt face any problems when the charge is less the voice clarity seems to be less,23,44
2710,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,bought this blu-tooth to replace another that was uncomfortable the outside the ear design works great for me light weight i hardly notice it is there,26,45
2711,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,this bluetooths quality is comparable to it is relative price you get what you pay for there is a large amount of static and a lot of back ground noise present when using it what upset me the most about it however is that the ear hook has broke after about a week,52,46
2712,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the one i got was ok but I had rather a different one i could hear others and others could hear me fairly well sometimes i needed to speak louder than usual the worst problem with it was it did not stay on my ear securely the unit sits on the outside of the ear with the loop that goes above the ear but if i turned my head quickly it would swing out slightly and then bounce back on to my head and the person you were talking to could here a bump i do not like worrying if this one will fall off my face,104,47
2713,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,motorola makes a good product but there are better bluetooth devices out there i found the h500 not comfortable it does not fit around your ear properly it falls easily off your ear and the reception is not all that good,39,48
2714,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought this for my wife to use with her motorola w755 phone it was a great buy she is very pleased with it the sound is very clear and it has great battery life also it was very easy to set up we put off buying a bluetooth because of the cost but for about 20 including shipping why wait any longer,63,49
2715,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,it acted as thought it was muted when it was not i tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones the person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it i did try to turn the mute off all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard,63,50
2716,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have owned this headset for about 3 years now the great thing about it is the clearity of the sound and the fact that i can also play music on my phone and listen to it through the earpiece it can get a little uncomfortable and the battery life is really short i use it while driving so my usage is not very long if your like me this will do the job,73,51
2717,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,got this headset because my old one was hurting my ear something awful one of those that you have to ram into your ear to get it to stay i love this little thing it is very comfortable it just hangs against your ear and almost feels like it is not even there usability is easy it just simply does it is job wonderfully,61,52
2718,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this product was good till a few days later when the i make a call the other person hears alot of back ground noise and interference went after my refund not that good,33,53
2719,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,my husband is enjoying this headset he recently dropped it in water and dried it with a hairdryer it still continues to perform correctly,24,54
2720,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,I have seen others for a higher price but this is a good product volume could go a little higher but I am a bit hard of hearing anyway,27,55
2721,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,for under 20 this blow the over-priced jabras out of the water i can actually hear other people talk without holding the ear piece in my ear battery lasts a couple of weeks without recharging,35,56
2722,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bougth this handsfree because i need to use the phone when i drive and works well and the battery charge duration is high,24,57
2723,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i can not even rate him on the product because i have not even recieved thethat i ordered from him in the middle of april i do not know what the hold up is but i sent whomever a email and i still have not heard back from them either customer service with these individuals is not really up there for me,59,58
2724,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i had brought the pink motorola ear piece and when a friend saw mine and asked how it worked i said comfortable and great they wanted me to order them one so this is the second order of this product,40,59
2725,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i got this for my boyfriend now that ca has the hands free law while driving he loves this earpiece it is way better than the plantronics one i bought for myself on a lightning deal and it was cheaper sometimes his phone does not get reception in our apartment and he will actually use the bluetooth because it gets better signal so this earpiece actually improves is phone in bad reception areas best purchase I have made and the shipping was super fast it arrived in only a few days,87,60
2726,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i have used this bluetooth a couple of times in good reception areas and those times each person i talked to said i did not sounds as good as i could on a bluetooth on my end i hear alot of noise background like an airy sound motorola makes better bluetooth devices so do not waste your money on this one you get what you pay for,63,61
2727,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have never used bluetooth devices before so i was a little worried since this one was so inexpensive it was super easy to install and i have not have any problems hearing or being heard during a conversation i am very happy with thisand i would suggest it too my friends,53,62
2728,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied with my blue tooth i purchased from amazon the length of time i ordered and recieved it was quick also the blue tooth was new in good condition i am very satisfied with amazon i have ordered more items and got them quick and in good condition,51,63
2729,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,it works well with my motorola phone clear and easy to use the only problem i have is that it pinches my ear and after wearing it for a while my ear gets sore i only wear it when i am driving so i can deal with it,48,64
2730,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the price was right and the bluetoothworks very well i have no problem recomending it harry,18,65
2731,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i really like this headset i use it for my phone and ps3 it works great i love it i have not had a problem with anything,26,66
2732,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,functions ok not great ok it is older technology biggest flaw I am going to is poorly designed main control button if it was recessed it might be ok as it is the button is easily engaged unintentionally even in the moto belt clip case specifically designed for this hardware it accidentally activates and you are left wondering why your phone says connected but you can not hear anyone good price here much less than i paid years ago decent value worked fine w / moto razor synced up with my new blackberry no problem if you keep it somewhere when it is not on your head where it will not activate spontaneously it should get the job done,115,67
2733,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,ok so i have had several nice bluetooth headsets in the past I am a heavy user and needed a spare so i picked up this one because i could not pass up on the cost savings and the other reviews for this product were decent after 2 weeks all i can say is if you are looking for a good bluetooth pass this up and she shall out the 40 or more dollars to get a better one cons several times my connection has dropped mid-call for no reason about 5 times over 2000 minutes of use should you ever drop that call there is no way for you to reconnect without hanging up on the call and dialing that person / conference back you can not have the volume turned all the way up which is sometimes necessary to hear properly that is conference calls the other person will get their own feedback pros price it does work and call quality is clear it is still better than using wired headphones when it works,173,68
2734,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this is a fairly good bluetooth headset very easy to use and it feels comfortable when placed on the ear audio quality is good as well as the mic the earpiece although felt a little bit flimsy and would not stay on my ear properly the one thing although that i had a problem with was the battery life on the headset i got barely 2 full hours of talk time before it started beeping like crazy which meant that i had to charge it soon,86,69
2735,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,as mentioned by others i have zero problem hearing or being heard with this unit it is easy to use compact and fits in my pocket without problem my razr likes it as well my only problem is that my fingers are fairly beefy and the volume buttons are tiny for my fingers still i manage with care to make the thing work for me with few problems overall I have been extremely pleased particularly given the price much more than one would have expected for this very low dollar amount,89,70
2736,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i got this product fast the first day that amazon said that i would i took it out of the package clear she shall bubble and pluged it in to charge comes with a black motorola charger for the two hours it asked for and went to my phone told it to find it it synced flawlessly i have been using it for a day now placed three calls and received five no complaints everyone could hear me and i could definitely hear them i own an i335 from boost if your looking for a low priced headset you can get this one,103,71
2737,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,it is fine but tends to come on easily in the carry case people i speak with complain of tinny sound,21,72
2738,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this blue tooth head set orks great with my motorola phone only problem is it is backside hook is not feixible if it does not fit your eye lobe size you can use this fortunately it fits mine almost so i can use it if you are buying a blue tooth make sure you try it on before you buy it,60,73
2739,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,this blue tooth is a great deal for the price it works very well and i can hear people loud and clear I have had no problem with them hearing me and it fits very comfortably in the ear it is worth buying the only problem is it turns on way too easy because of where the power button is if i have it in my pocket it answers the phone all time even when I have shut it off many times I have answered my phone and could not hear anyone talking then i hear a strange sound coming from my pocket just to find that my bluetooth answered even although i had turned the power off and i do not wear tight jeans extremely annoying but it was a great price so i think I shall just leave it in the car from now on i do not regret buying it,146,74
2740,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i will be honest for the price i was not expecting too much it is sooo comfy on my tiny ears it sounds so clear and everyone hears me just fine well worth buying,33,75
2741,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this unit sucks threw it in the trash i should have read the other reviews before i ordered,18,76
2742,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i bought it cos was cheap i sold it already it did work as i expected,16,77
2743,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,they shipment was very fast and it product was wonderful would order from them again,15,78
2744,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the motorola h500 bluetooth is bulky and has a poor sound quality i wold not recommend it,17,79
2745,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this items was horrible the sound quality was poor with static and the bluetooth hung off the ear falling off i returned and would only recommend purchasing bluetooths with adjustable ear and not ordering online go to a store to try on the product,43,80
2746,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i purchased the motorola h500 because i had another one just like it i was not as happy with this one when i talk to other people they tell me they hear a hum throughout the conversation I am not sure why it is doing that I am not sure if anyone should buy the same one i did,56,81
2747,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,to own a bluetooth headset the right fit is essential for me this one lacked comfort maybe it is the shape of my ear but it just never felt sturdy on my ear switching from one ear to the other is very simple although pairing is very easy as well volume is quite low for me even at it is highest level when talking to someone they usually tell me that they can not hear me clearly as if I am very far away i can not hear the other person very clearly either unless i push the headset against my hear with my hand kind of a bummer when you buy one to be hands-free when a call comes in the headset makes it is own sound to notify you which is nice however overall i do not like it there are better headsets out there so i suggest you pass on this one,145,82
2748,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i have two of these models one has the more talk time both are not very good i can hear people fine but others have a very hard time hearing me i even tried it on a razr new chocolate lg and now an env2 it is not the phones it is the headsets do not buy this one or any on that looks like or similar to this,66,83
2749,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this headset was comfortable easy to pair easy to use looks nice and has a simple design and setup i also had no problems hearing the other person on the line however the person on the other line said i sounded like i was down in a well haha so overall it is not crystal clear quality for the other person especially if they are not on a landline however this is a very simple headset that gets the job done it is also very reasonably priced,84,84
2750,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i owned one of these before the same model and for some reason this one has some much static the other person can not hear you i am very sorry that i lost my old one and tried to replace it with this one i wish there was a way for me to return it,55,85
2751,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i only bought a bluetooth headset because of the new handsfree law in california i only charge it once a week and it lives in my car for the rest of the time i have had it for about a month and there are no problems with it,48,86
2752,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i have been using this headset for a month and basically am happy with the purchase it is easy to use and works reliably the only complaint i have is the ear hook is a bit loose and tends to fall off if imy head to one side while talking,51,87
2753,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,title really says it all this is a decent product for the cost works fine minimal needs,17,88
2754,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought this unit to replace the nokia unit i lost over a holiday I am not fond of fancy features and originally bought the h350 at best buy for twice the price of this h500 i have a nokia 6103 and it intitally took about 5 tries to link it to my phone but it works fine now voices can be heard clearly simple answer / call button and so far the battery life is better than expected I have only had it a few days although so time will tell volume buttons are straightforward and the blue status light is a nice touch can be distracting to some there is some slight crackle and distortion even when in close range to the phone possibly from static electricity or other isolated em interference where i was using it but it was never enough to be troublesome it is light clips securely to the ear is symmetrical for left / right wear has a soft coating and I have been wearing it all day without any discomfort i bought this directly from amazon and had it in 3 days overall a fine unit at a great price,191,89
2755,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i bought this headset so that i can use with my ps3 and play online at 1st it was great no problems after about a week of use i started to experience more and more complaints about static also it disconnects wayyyy to much i would say to go for a wired headset instead overall although it did what it was suppose to do,64,90
2756,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,product is fine only problem i talk at a good level for people to hear me over the blue tooth and they have trouble hearing me and frequesnt clicks and pops occur besides that great product,36,91
2757,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this is a reasonably good product at a very reasonable price less than 30 here on amazon i would feel less impressed if I had paid 75 at a verizion store it was very easy to set up with a rzrv3 works fairly well long battery life my only complaint is that it is very easy for me to hit the answer button a fraction too long and get last number re-dial instead that being said i am happy with the performance for the price and would recomend highly for a first timer or non-techie,100,92
2758,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,first time i answered a call i could not believe the clarity on the headset it is easier and faster to answer a call with a click than searching for your phone i wear glasses and one is thin rim and one is thick I am able to use both with my headset and have no problem i highly recommend the h500 yours truly mr orta,63,93
2759,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,I have ordered a few of these before for me and my mother inlaw they worked great but these last two i purchased have taken a serious nose dive in sound quality voices comming through the headset are now very distorted and i have to ask people to repeat themselves alot I am only keeping mine till i can find a better one then I am tossing it my wife was so frustrated with hers she will not even touch it,77,94
2760,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i recommend it to anyone that wants a cheap bluetooth head set it is a little bit loose on my ear but it works perfectly,25,95
2761,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i purchased three of these from amazon for my two sony ericsson w580is and one samsung a737 all three paired quickly and correctly the only problem was that there was constant buzzing heard by the person receiving the call from all three cell phones as a test i paired all three of my cell phones with my existing samsung wep200 bluetooth headset instead no buzzing from any of the phones i ended up returning all three h500s and purchased the wep200s instead i do not know if the three i received were defective but for sure there were not compatible with my cell phones,104,96
2762,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i get tones of people complaining that I am muffled or asking if I am behind a cloth i also get the question asking how far away from the phone are you a good bluetooth is one that the receiver of the call can not tell your using,45,97
2763,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,not the worst thing around but still a bit awkward sometimes i would have difficulty turning it on / off as the device would bounce to another command on the multi-function key also while it was comfortable it was not very stable I had put my sunglasses on or pull them off and have to readjust the devices placement or risk it falling off it always felt a bit unstable anyways unless i did not have my sunglasses on but living in southern california sunglasses are a daily necessity,84,98
2764,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i would have liked to have knowen that the blue tooth motorola h500 was peace of carp and did not work for carp befor i bought it i found that the prices on amz are inflated i was looking at grills and seen a charcoal grill for 13500 i found the same grill at our local store for 2499 so i do not trust amz anylonger,65,99
2765,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,the price was right but i would go with something smaller next time does not sit on my ear too good last a good amount of time,26,100
2766,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i bought this headset thinking it would not be as good as some others but when i got it and gave it a go it works great sometimes there has static that comes through and wind causes problems if you have your windows down while you are driving other than that it is a great headset,52,101
2767,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is an excellent headset for the price the controls area easy to use and the microphone is great you do have to talk up a little but not that much my only complaint is that if i stick it in my pocket it has a tendency to turn on and make random phone calls,55,102
2768,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,it was a gift for my husband I am very please and so is he thank you mercedes,17,103
2769,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this bluetooth was my first and worst i could not hear alot on it and it did not stay on my ear for nothing i would stay away,26,104
2770,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the only upside to this product was the ease in pairing it with my motorola q perhaps i have abnormal ears but i could never manage to successfully wear this headset i tried it on both ears but it never stayed still it was always flapping around on the side of my head because i never got a firm fit i had to turn the volume all the way up to use it but it still was not loud enough if you wear glasses or have small ears assume you will have the same problems I have owned the product for nearly a year and have used it about 4 times in total absolutely not worth any price even if the phone store gives it to you for free,128,105
2771,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,while i will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit if you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times but if you want to turn it off that is a whole different story powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function i have frequently called someone just by trying to turn off the device the button is also entirely too sensitive I have had the device in my cargo pants pocket where this would be very little pressure on the device and the unit has turned on and actually called someone other issues are the charging indication is not real clear and there is not anyof knowing how charged the battery is and the device is not quite as comfortable as other devices that i have used it is bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money,219,106
2772,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i love the convenience of this product however the people i speak to using this product report a constant buzzing they frequently ask me to pick up the phone and turn off the bluetooth i also have difficulty figuring out if it is on or not i will think it is on and make the call only to figure out the person is on the handset and when i try to activate mid call it hangs up on them 75 of the time,82,107
2773,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this bluetooth sucks i have to yell for people to hear me people always complain of hearing static from my end it is easier to use speakerphone on the handset rather than using the headset,34,108
2774,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i actually bought this headset to pair with my ps3 for online chat i have to say syncing it was a breeze and i did not experience any problems i have not tried it with a phone but i have the h550 paired with my lg vx8700 and i love it i was able to pick this headset up at radio shack for 20,61,109
2775,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,in contrast to the other katillion ear buds that basically do not work or are frustratingly uncomfortable this little gem is easy to use and nice to wear i misplaced my first one and bought another highly recommended,38,110
2776,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,light weight easy to use one charge last very long that you end up forget it needs power,18,111
2777,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,I have had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear it appears to wobble around the ear and leaves me with the feeling that it is going to fall off at any time i wear eyeglasses and the fit is very poor there are many better headsets out there that fit more comfortably and do not leave you wondering what is going to happen,75,112
2778,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i had one but ordered this one for my husband to give him freedom while driving and doing chores around the house he loves his as much as i love mine and now i do not have to share,38,113
2779,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought this to replace another unit that was hurting my ear one of those that wrap around and have a small rubber piece that goes inside your ear it is very light and comfortable to wear and with easy access to volume / answer / end / mute buttons sounds good and holds it is charge well the trade-off between this type and those that wrap around your eat is that the former can flop around if you are leaning to one side and/or jogging / running but who talks while doing that on the other hand i prefer this kind because nothing enters your ear and they are more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time i use mine when sitting at the computer and/or doing other tasks around the house or while driving / walking it works great in any of those scenarios,136,114
2780,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,love this headset as stated above i returned the plantronics model that everybody was raving about the only model more archaic than the plantronics 510 would have to be one of those hideous jabra models the motorola is the headset i wish I had bought the 1st time around it is suprisingly comfortable and does not take long to forget you are wearing it there is no intrusion into the ear canal allowing full air circulation and unhampered hearing of your surroundings the earhook is slim and does not interfere with wearing sunglasses which is something i can not say about the plantronics 510 pairing was a snap with my sanyo 7050 mil-spec phone i was willing to spend more for a headset however this one meets my needs I am happy,128,115
2781,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this is the best bluetooth i have owned sound is clear and i rarely lose the connection like i have with previous units highly recommend it,26,116
2782,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i ordered this product expecting a new one as mentioned but instead i received a used product with a flimsy packing they did not even send me a sales receiptthis product looks like a refurbished one which was not mentioned intiallyotherwise it works ok,43,117
2783,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,purchased this headset for use with the ps3 and it works flawlessly with most games the only issues i have had is with it going to sleep while playing resistance if there was someway to program the headset so that this feature could be turned off it would be nice matches the ps3 inand has worked both with my computer and cell phones bluetooth feature so a very reliable headset good battery life clear reception and a great price make this a must buy,86,118
2784,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i have to say that this is my first bluetooth product so i have nothing to compare it to that being said i will put in my 2 cents on this one my biggest complaint is that is does not fit tightly to my ear kind of flops around and i have a hard time hearing sometimes i only use it in my car so it does what i need right now but i would not wear it anywhere else for fear it would fall off it does hold a charge for a good while and people seem to be able to hear me ok so it does have some good points i am very petite so maybe a bigger person would have more luck with the fit,128,119
2785,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my wife for the convenience of having her hands free while driving or in the kitchen or working in the yard my first bluetooth was this model but when i used it people complained that the mike picked up too much ambient noise and had a noticeable echo other than that one complaint everything else worked fine the range was as advertised as well as the talk and standby time the battery charged quickly and lasted for several days depending on how much i talked of course and it paired easily with the motorazr v3 m i upgraded to the h-700 because of it is noise suppression chip but was very disappointed with it the range was horrible and had to deal with a lot of static the noise suppression chip is worthless i retired the 700 and I am using something else now the h-500 headset is not the best one out there but for the money it is better than the h-700 hands down,167,120
2786,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,motorola h500 bluetooth headset soft touch black [ motorola retail packaging ] i love this bluetooth headset hands free is real good,24,121
2787,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,it is a good blue tooth but i can not say that i am overly impressed it sits on the outside of your ear not too firmly therefore while driving and turn your head quickly it shakes itself loose and is annoying the range is not too good as well i get alot of interference when my cellphone is in it is holster on my belt i usually have to bring the phone closer to the headset to get good reception i also tried using it as a earphone for an mp3 player / pda i have the sound quality is not good enough to listen to music otherwise it is ok i had a moto bluetooth i bought a few years ago and i am just disapointed that it is performance has not chnaged much,131,122
2788,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,I am so glad to have this bluetooth everyone should have one today there is not excuse to drive holding the phone in your hand when u can use these headset they are a must have and they are not expensive,40,123
2789,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i have been wanting a bluetooth headset for a long time i finally decided to invest some money into one and this is what i found it has worked perfectly ever since i received it in the mail the shipping was very prompt and fair overall because of amazoncom this was a great buying experience with a great product,59,124
2790,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i received the product a few weeks ago i immediately realized that it was not going to sit well on my ear and ever since then i have had trouble hearing from it i have to consistently push the bluetooth headset towards my ear to hear better i should have gotten the plantronics,53,125
2791,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this headset seems to be the preferred headset of my friends however whenever I am not in a dead-still silent room people have told me that I am completely unrecognizable this is especially the case when I am in my car granted i drive an acura rsx which is not known for it is quiet ride but nevertheless i need something better i tested it out once listening to messages that i left on other peoples voicemails and it sounds like i was in an underground cellar surrounded byso if you are going to be using this only only while in a dead silent room this is the way to go for ease of use if you are going to use it any other way try something better i still am personally researching what a good headset would be i may try the plantronics 510 or another more expensive plantronics i hear that the jawbone sounds good but is very poorly constructed,158,126
2792,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,the headset did everything i needed it to do for 30 less than what verizon was going to charge me for it so i call it a win-win on all fronts check it out,33,127
2793,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i got this from a company called globalizer out of the package i was able to charge it and pair it with my phone but the sound quality was poor and the device did not work as well as the one i got from the verizon store and ran through the washing machine for example it would not pickup phone calls or disconnect them using the headset button had to open the phone for those operations the company allowed me only to return the device at my expense for a replacement the sound quality of the replacement is better but it still will not pickup or disconnect using the headset button i also have difficulty getting starting and ending the bluetooth connection my advice it to purchase this unit at a store where you can easily return it rather than buying online,143,128
2794,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,the motorola headset is no the best headset i have used but is ok the sound quality is not enough to rate a 5 star but i can give it a 4 star,33,129
2795,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i really wanted a bluetooth headset when i got my sch-u740 phone seeing a deal like this i could not pass it up easy to setup and sync with the phone i only have two problems with the headset 1 whenever i press the headset button to recieve a call there is a slight delay in answering this might be a problem with the phone and not the headset 2 it moves around a little too much for me sometimes when I am taking a turn in my car the headset will move a little bit same thing when i turn my head other than those little problems it is a bargain,109,130
2796,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,similiar to other comments the headset does not fit well too loose and flaps a bit when turning my head there are also times where i need to press the headset to my ear to hear the other person this can be annoying on a long conference call and takes away the virtue of being hands free,56,131
2797,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,for the money the hs500 works well the only thing that an expierenced user may notice is that the sound quality could be a little better but overall it is a good model for the money,35,132
2798,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like this product for it is obvious convenience and ease of usage the only reason why it is not getting 5 stars is I am use to the speaker to be a little louder and the maximum volume on this just is not enough and i find myself pushing it against my ear which totally defeats the purpose of handsfree besides that i really enjoy having this since i am a daily commuter if you plan on using this while driving then the volume issue may come into affect but it is really a personal preference if you are planning on using it mostly in a quiet environment then it is perfect range is great also,110,133
2799,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,worked as advertized usb charger great you do not need additional chargers works with other usb device chargers with same connectors clear sound and good controls for answering and volume,29,134
2800,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,this headset is lite-weight and fits snugly on the ear the sound quality is excellent,15,135
2801,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this is probably a very good product as most motorola products are the one which i received however did not stay connected to the phone and it would dial the last called number on it is own it also would beep in your ear all of the time i sent it back and received a prompt refund including my shipping costs,60,136
2802,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,there is a lot of background noise the person on the other end has a hard time hearing what I am saying,21,137
2803,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i tried the unit to my surprise i thought it was cool but the person on the other end did not there is this terrible buzzing noise going on maybe the one i have is defective other than that i would recommend the product,44,138
2804,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this bluetooth worked ok for me but it just would not fit right for me it had a very loose fit so i exchanged it for the motorola h700 which is smaller and fits much better,35,139
2805,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the product hardly stays fit in the ear and both sound and microphone qualities are not so good i would not recommend it,23,140
2806,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,it works fine but sometimes it just stops linking my calls and i have to re sync it with my phone honestly sometimes i feel that i was safer in the car talking on my phone by my ear either way it is still really cool when it works,46,141
2807,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i am extremely happy with the headset i received and e-tronics has such great customer service it was no joke a pleasure doing business with them thanks,27,142
2808,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,headset is great in the car or in the house when you are outside in the wind or at a noisy location it blows for my usage it works fine i originally bought this from the t-mobile store for about 2x the price on amazon i lost it so the better price made my anger from losing the headset a little better,61,143
2809,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,overall a great product i have the motorola razr phone so i originally bought the matching razr headset also made by motorola but as soon as i opened the package one of the volume buttons did not work i of course returned it and then decided to do some research to find what headsets had the best performance while researching i found that other people had encountered the non-working volume button issue with the razr headsets so you might want to stay away from those i ultimately decided on this headset based on these aspects light weight good battery life and good reviews durable good volume ease of use longevity the looks are pretty good too i read many reviews on all different models and overall what i read about this headset was that it was pretty reliable and people were pleased with it plus the thing was like 30 with shipping i use it all the time no problems yet and no complaints,163,144
2810,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,very good headset the battery does not need to be recharged too often which is very convenient good sound quality the earhook is a little loose but that is not a major issue,31,145
2811,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,after a small amount of screwing around the h500 connected with my nokia n75 without a hitch i find that if you firmly place the ear loop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fits firmly and does not come loose i agree that the volume could go higher however in a quiet room it is adequate I am told that I am clearly heard on the other end of the connection this is also in a quiet room small and lite i think this a rather nifty piece of gear,94,146
2812,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,great product to buy for price i really recommend this product it was shipped promptly,15,147
2813,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,both my wife and i own these and we are both annoyed enough with them that i went out and bought her an old-school wired headset the other day to replace hers i dropped mine about a week in from four feet up onto pavement and the ear-clip chipped making it fall out from time to time definitely not rugged construction this unit picks up all kinds of background noise and garbles the voice so that you have to shout slowly to be understood at all in addition about 60 of the time when placing a call you will be able to hear the person you called but they will not be able to hear you at all and you will have to redial to get through,127,148
2814,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i recieved a defective h500 which i can not blame amazon for only motorola and the dealer amazon sent me a new bluetooth express delivery and i had it with in 3 days after i recieved the defective one they also paid for the shipping cost for the defective model i just want to commend amazon for their great customer service also the device works great there has a slight echo but i knew that when i bought it,77,149
2815,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,once i got used to wearing it i do not drive without it it was a great investment on my part i had priced them through cingular and it was double the price i am very pleased with my purchase,39,150
2816,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i use this in the car and people have trouble understanding what i say i always must shout to be heard it picks up a lot of backround noise it also mutes itself on answering and i get more hangfrom people who called and can not hear me respond try another model this was my first bluetooth headset purchase and I am looking at a different one,67,151
2817,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,i bought this for my husband after i had gotten a bluetooth headset and loved it i got a different one palm one treo and i loved mine his is not good the piece behind the ear is not nearly as adjustable as mine is mine is moldable so you can sqeeze it and play with it until it fits the back of your ear this one is just what it looks like you can not quickly switch from one ear to the next on this one either i also liked mine because i was able to program different rings for different people or groups of people on my phone then when my earpiece would ring i could hear the different rings and know who was calling me without having to get my actual phone out of my purse his phone does that too but the headset only rings the main tone not the different rings it also picks up tons of background noise much more than mine when he has in his truck he has an old 1972 chevy all you hear is the loud engine if you are looking for just a basic headset that does not have many features then this is fine but if you want more for your money do not get it mine was the same price as this one,218,152
2818,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,first alittle backround i live in albuquerque new mexico and they just inforced a no driving with out a hands free device i would not have purchased a bluetooth headset other wise i hardly use it other than when I am driving the headset works and does it is thing but the volume even on it is highest setting is still to low to have the radio on or the windows down as a whole the headset works and does what it is supposed to,81,153
2819,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,the sound quality is good however pairing is a problem many a times if the headset is fully discharged then you have to pair it again with your phone and it does not always works in the first attempt the biggest problem is the fit on your ear i have average earlobes and it never fitted comfortably i always had a feel that it will fall down this is especially a problem while driving as when you are taking a turn and looking on your sides moving your head fast you feel that the headset will fall off this is the most annoying thing it is not very sturdy product too the small little thing that fits in your ear it broke after two months only it simply fell on the floor in a store and the damn thing broke it can not even stand a simple fall from such small height man-height i would strongly suggest to find something more robust sturdy and one which can fit more better on your ears always first try in a store and make sure that it does not break easily,185,154
2820,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,wonderful transaction the product arrived quickly and was exactly what i wanted highly recommend the seller,16,155
2821,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,motorola puts out some very good products but this one motorola h500 headset was a real disappointment it is compact and easy to sync to a phone but the volume is way way too low to be useful in most stituations particularly traffic i have adjusted it a number of times to the highest setting and it is about half the volume of other bluetooth ear pieces i have good price poor buy,73,156
2822,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this headset fit great in my ear it is look is very cool but a few flaws 1 volume buttons are not easy to reach once the unit is fitted in your ear 2 using it in windy conditions may get you in an uncomfortable conversation hello are you there it feels like you are within a hurricane and i do not mean only outdoors you maybe inside your car with the a / c on and if it is blowing right at your face you will get this kind of problem,85,157
2823,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the headset produced static that could be heard by anyone i called they could not hear my voice over the static awful i bought this for the cheap price and would have given it to my daughter if it was merely not as good as i wanted it was awful and i returned it for credit,55,158
2824,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,yes it matches my phone excellent head set i hear them and they hear me what else do you needmotorola h500 headset over-the-ear wireless bluetooth,33,159

2829,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,did not particularly like this product have had the h850 and the h700 bluetooth headset in the past and both operated much better battery life was short in this model,29,164
2830,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,[ ] when i received it it came with insructions of what to do it was no problem setting it up once i put it on it was light weight and i could hardly ntice it except sometimes it became loose and the link between the ps3 and the headset died i could hear people but i could not talk back also before using it i had to go to the menu for the ps3 to pick up the connection this only took a couple of second but i could have lived without it in other words this product is good with a strong connection but at times the link is dropped and your call may be dropped as well,118,165
2831,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,honestly i recommend this product since their acting is very good the duration of the battery is excellent it is a very good purchase les recomiendo este producto a todas las personas que busquen un buen bluetooth su desempeo es muy bueno es una excelente compra,46,166

2833,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i use this with my computer phone the quality is in and out for the sound sometimes it is great sometimes it is not my friends also complain of a reverb if i have the headset volume up too high the upside is that it does work for a good distance so i can leave the computer and not worry about loosing the signal probably would end up spending more next time to get a higher quality headset but for my uses right now it works just fine,86,168
2834,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,bought this ear piece for my on-the-go guy back in january and he loves it he says it is light weight and very practical since he is always on the road perhaps it is too light-weight although they have been a few times when he has been heading to the shower or to bed with it the plus for me i can still talk to him when hockey is on cuz he does not mind being on the phone o men,75,169
2835,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,I am very happy with the motorola h500 bluetooth headset it is easy to use and very comfortable to wear the one button to place or answer a call makes it easy to concentrate on driving still having both hands on the wheel and both eyes on the road while using the phone I am also very impressed with the clarity and sound of the ear piece i can hear the caller clearly even with the radio on and the microphone makes it possible to speak in a normal voice and still be heard i recommend it highly to anyone who uses a cell phone while driving no matter how often or infrequently you make calls,113,170
2836,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i received thisdoa i went through the process to send it back for a return it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received any form of correspondence from the seller,35,171

2842,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the h500 that i purchsed stinks i get nothing but complaits from people that i am speaking to that it is garbold and can only hear every other word i can honestly say that i never been through so much dissatisfaction with a product ever maybe this bluetooth earpiece was not designed for my razor phone even although they are both made by the same company hey motorola do us all a favor start testing your products before you sellem,77,177

2844,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,the black headset we have had some problems with there is an echo and when it is not echoing we still have a problem of the volume on the other persons line they can never hear us we also have a pink h500 and that one works great there are no problems maybe we just got a bad one but other than that it is easy to use and it is small,69,179
2845,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,i bought the motorola h500 bluetooth headset soft touch in black because i like to have both hands free while driving the headset does not always remain on my ear it may just be my ear shape it can be difficult to hear at times i just wish i would have looked into other options rather than following the bluetooth trend,61,180
2846,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,great deal great price works great clear sound very comfortable lightweight in fact i dropped mine in the grocery store parking lot and it was crushed i am looking to buy the exact same model i was so pleased,40,181
2847,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought this primarily to use with skype it works mostly good and it is b3etter than the h820 that i own however with skype the quality drops a little bit i am sort of satisfied with it but i still get static sometimes the bluetooth connector that came with it will not connect i had to buy a cheap bluetooth connector by logitechg,64,182
2848,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,fast friendly service i ordered my blue tooth headset and had it lightning fast i am very pleased with the product i recieved it is as advertisted i will do business with this company again as the need arrives,39,183
2849,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,while this device connected well with the razor cell phone it does not hold to your ear this inconvenience makes it somewhat useless,23,184
2850,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i could not live without it i had alot of trouble with the corded ear pieces because they really hurt my ears this product causes no pain i can usually hear just fine unless the person on the other side also has theirs on then i have to turn up the volume with this you can flip the ear harness and use it on either ear i have voice dialing on my phone and can use it with this also love it it can be a little tempermental some times but that means little when compared to the convenience,99,185

2854,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,the motorola h500 bluetooth headset looks pretty cool however it does not perform very well when phone reception is not at a maximum most of the time i can hear the people i talk to just fine but my friends tell me that i sound fuzzy when i talk despite it is shortcommings this headset is especially handy when you want to talk to someone while you are driving a standard transmission vehicle,69,189
2855,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,as good as if not better than the older moto bluetooth hss a little tricky to get to bond the first time with v551 phone dell axim and pc bluetooth but after the first time no problem no noticeable intereference when using excellent standby time a week for me sound volume and clarity excellent background noise is muted on the mic can not use it to listen to mp3s on the axim although also can not use it for skype on the axim either,83,190
2856,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,thisis good works good for me only complaint may be that whoever ur talking to may have a hard time hearing you sometimes other than that it is good,30,191
2857,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,sometimes it works sometimes it does not when it works it works great when it does not work about 10 of the time the older h500 i had before i lost it worked all the time this is the second newer one I have had and they do not work as well better than nothing i guess,53,192
2858,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,with this headset i can type or do housework even drive and keep my attention focused where it needs to be i do not know how i got along without this,30,193
2859,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,this is my first bluetooth headset purchase i think this is a good entry level piece it works just fine functions as it should if you do not put the earpiece on just right then you may have some issues with clarity and volume both on your own side as well as your caller also it may flap a little if you do not get it to just just right when you put it on and that can be irritating for the price although this is the best deal and value i did not want to spend 100 on a gadget in case i did not like it this was a good choice now i know i made the right decision i liek my bluetooth but am not in love with it it works great in the car if allowed where you live it is perfect for long rides i can not stand it although when people use it in the stores while shopping,157,194
2860,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i received thisfrom tiger direct one of your sub sellers the piece came to me very hygienically dirty had ear and face oils on it very heavy actually disgusting where the blue tooth folds together very dirty the rubber piece that seals the ear from the outside was torn i called tiger direct and they had no issues with me returning it the girl gave me all the right info to do just that the unit worked well so i cleaned it with q-tips and glued the ear piece i really did not want to go through this mailing thing back and forth if you folks are going to sell used products you should have a quality control plan i am not happy and hope you guys will take care of this for the future,136,195
2861,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,i recieved the exact product at the time i expected and was told it would arrive i am completely satisfied with my purchase,23,196
2862,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,this is my first bluetooth headset and while I am impressed with the technology i was definitely not impressed with the design of this headset it does not secure very well to the ear which means that the headset flops around on the ear requiring so much re-adjustment during conversation that it negates the moniker handsfree,55,197
2863,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,easy to use not too bad looking would purchase again and recommend to others,15,198
2864,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,was a greatfor gifting and the person who has received it is pretty pleased wit it,17,199
2865,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i purchased this unit to use with my motorola v3 razr cell phone so that i could talk hands-free with people while i did things around the house it replaced my previous headset a motorola hs810 which i let get exposed to water whoops despite the higher price tag on the hs810 i feel this is a better headset it is very sturdy-I have dropped it on my hardwood floor and it still works just fine there is no unfolding boom mike with a hinge that wears out the controls are simple-hold down the call button to turn it on or off tap it to answer or hang up mating the device to my phone was simple and took seconds and i have not had it drop a call yet the microphone seems to work very well-I have never had anyone complain that they could not hear me and I have used the unit outside in windy conditions of course there are some negatives i wish the volume was louder-i have it turned up all the way and it still sounds a little faint the earpeice is tight and secure but it also pinches so long calls are going to be uncomfortable it is also not as eye-catching as some other bluetooth headsets if you want a workhorse headset that is dependble reliable and sturdy this is the unit for you it is a great value for the price,230,200
2866,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,no matter which manufacturer or what model it has become impossible to get a positive opinion on a bluetooth headset these days everybody just keeps whining about range read up on bluetooth technology will ya crackle low volume and disconnects I am glad i took the user reviews for the h500 with a grain of salt overcame my fear and got this headset for my nokia 6230i pairing was a cinch in over two weeks of use i have yet to experience a disconnect volume and clarity are pretty darn good range is excellent for bluetooth and battery life is amazing 4 days to a charge on average with fairly extensive use i have tested this headset while on foot outside and while driving my car no problemo my suggestion to the nitpickers complaining about these headsets state the make and model of your mobile phone in your reviews it could very well be that it is your mobile phone that is to blame for your poor experiences specifying the type of phone you use will enable potential buyers with the same phone to steer clear while the rest of us can go ahead and enjoy the wonders of 21st century technology by the way i am technologically savvy have had bluetooth headsets for over a year now and if you have not guessed it yet am very very happy with the motorola h500 highly recommended,233,201
2867,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i like this headset because it is not big bulky complicated or ugly it has a volume up and down button and an on / off button just what i wanted nothing fancy but still looks nice easy to use and comfortable,39,202
2868,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,this was my first bluetooth headset and what a mistake it does not fit close to my ear and i am constantly pushing it into my ear it feels like it will fall off at any time the biggest problem however is that it turns on with the slightest pressure i have recalled many people not knowing i have done so it is very frustrating when you are trying to make a call with the phone you think that the connection did not go through until you realize that the dumb headset has turned on in your purse i bought motorola because i expected it to be better than a less known brand it is very disappointing,116,203
2869,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i found that it will not connect easy and drops will not reconnect unless i turn phone off i had a hs820 my puppy eat it wow what a mistake with this one motorola very very sad always support there stuff,41,204
2870,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,i purchased a family plan for my partner and i and we got these for headsets within 3 days we exchanged them 3 times each none of them worked even the verizon salesman could not make them work we were never able to dial out using voice commands and it kept turning itself off and on and in addition it was very hard to hear incoming calls and they constantly would fall off we dumped them and bought plantronics voyager 510 model g and they work fine do not waste your time and money on the h500 motorola what has up motorola,99,205
2871,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,the headset itself works and dials as advertised i have never had a problem with the recognition by the phone or with people hearing me major downside to this headset if there was a zero option i would use it my problem is the constant turning on and off of the headset the slightest pressure turns the headset on or off or worse yet dials the last person you called over and over and over again my brother had to turn his phone off one night because over a dozen calls were made by my phone becasue the bluetooth headset redialed this was with the heaset sitting on the counter next to the phone without anything touching it because of that i have not used the headset in over a month and left it uncharged without a charge it has not called once in that time go figure that one do not get this headset,155,206
2872,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i bought thisrecently and it took longer to ship than expected overall i think this product works well it is not a high-end bluetooth device but it is not cheap either the volume works great for me i actually have it on a medium setting because the volume all the way up is far too loud the only complaint i have is if another person is on a bluetooth or speakerphone it sounds as if i am in a tunnel,80,207
2873,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,i just received my bluetooth wireless earpiece yesterday and i am pleased to say that i really enjoy it it came sooner than what i expected i received exactly what was pictured online the bluetooth is very comfortable i have not had a problem with it falling out of my ear i would strongly reccommend this product to everybody since i just got the earpiece i can not say how long the talk time is on it thats why i only gave it 4 stars,83,208
2874,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,from all the previous reviews i am assuming that there might be some compatability issue between the headset and some phones or maybe some of these just come bad the one i recieved works great i can hear people just fine especially with the audio setting turned all the way up I have noticed that when i am in a loud room often people have a hard time hearding me but in the quiet of my car I have never had any complaints for me this headset has been worth it is weight in gold,92,209
2875,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,pros eye candy it is a cool looking headset cons audio level at it is highest level is low i had to push it against my ear to hear better it did not feel very secure on my ear slight head movements can make it move around / off the ear people i called sometimes complained of an echo,59,210
2876,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,3.0,neutral,my biggest problem is that the headset feels like it is falling off of my ear anytime i move I am afraid I shall lose it at any moment reception seems okay to me but sometimes people complain of an echo on the other end of the call which only occurs when i use the headset,54,211
2977,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,programmed in a foreign language and could not figure out how to make it work in english,17,0
2978,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,got this phone to replace one i have on att phone came in as t-mobile but that did not matter should still work did alright for about a month then boom the entire phone started going haywire ring tones backgrounds volume everything started going crazy had to pull out an old phone for the wife so she could receive calls and messages this is the first chance i have had to make a statement about the phone,75,1
2979,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,great phone even in a market where 2 years makes the last model seem laughable i have yet to find a phone that has such a good feel to it not too small to use comfortably yet still nice and thin i only wish that the ringer could be turned up a little louder,54,2
2980,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,this is the worst product i ever recevied product do not work made a report and ever email or even try to assist me sorry bad product,27,3
2981,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,the razr we purchased is so perfect i will never buy a non-unlocked phone again the phone is brand new and at the low price i can not believe we did not do this before the company did send a dead-battery originally but they made up for it by overnighting a replacement,50,4
2982,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,this phone is fantastic it takes care of all my needs phoning scheduling keeping track of people and data and more while traveling around the world it is sturdy and does not damage easily or initiate functions by accident easy to use and fun to use i love it and this is the second razr v3 that I have owned my only complaint is that it creates a completely different entry in the phone book for different phone numbers for the same contact my old razr v3 t kept them all in the same line,90,5
2983,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,this was purchased for my husband who does not want anything that is difficult to operate he likes it good clarity of sound and easy to use,25,6
2984,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,i am very pleased with the purchase i made i received the phone brand new from the seller and it was shipped to me within the time frame mentioned i was advised by a friend to view the site for unlocked phones and was quite surprised at the variety of model phones,52,7
2985,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,first of all i received an email telling me that the original silver one i ordered was not available would i accept a grey one instead these things happen so i said no problem the phone that arrived was not working the screen inside and out was dead i was given a return address and had to ship the thing back myself i can understand if i just did not want the phone but to eat the return shipping fees to return an obviously defectiveis something the seller needs to cover i feel completely used and will never do business with this company again this is the reason that i normally only deal with amazon shipping the gear as they will do the right thing and cover return shipping for defective merchandise too bad the same can not be said for this seller,143,8
2986,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,i am very happy with this phone it does everything i need it to do it is a good size and easy to use,24,9
2987,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,5.0,positive,perfect i wanted an extra phone for my trips out of the country it worked perfectly and still does could not be happier,22,10
2988,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,this is our second razr v3 so we are already familiar with the features and i was happy to find the same model still available we occassionaly travel outside the us and this phone has worked great elsewhere in the world we got tired of jockeying sim cards so will leave one set for the us and the other will be our travel phone when we need it the phone arrived promptly but i orded black and got silver the box and instruction book were labled for a black phone and the cd had obviously been used envelope wrinkled cd scratched so i think the box may have been cheery-picked over time the phone itself seemed to be unused so we will keep it and do something ourselves to distinguish it from our other silver razr,135,11
2989,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,the phone worked fine in india upon arrival we went to alltel booth where they installed a prepaid chip you need passport picture a copy of your passport local address and phone number i could call anywhere instantly,38,12
2990,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,have used razrs in past with good luck but this one broke within 6 months and amazon would not replace it so i would not buy another phone from them again,31,13
2991,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,4.0,positive,i have been a razr user for the past 3 years the new phone i received worked just as well as my previous one it was unlocked for sure it has worked with my sim card as soon as i put it in it has been the same case for my father in india as well after i gifted it to him he is quite happy with the phones functionality he was noticing that the batteries need charging every two to three days which apprently is unlike his previous phone a nokia i think that seems to be the only concern,101,14
2992,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,1.0,negative,i bought this phone because it looks like a nice phone i had big problems with the phone it did not work properly the phone would not hold a charge-the battery would die after making two phone calls unfortunately i had to return the phone and get my money back,50,15
2993,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000SZROBA,3.0,neutral,I have had this phone for almost a year and really did like it in the beginning the sound was excellent the button placement and size made dialing and texting fairly easy i was very happy with it then it started to fall apart the connections from the screen to the base started to go wonky the screen just randomly goes black and seems to like to stay that way if i squeeze and push the screen in just the right way i can get the picture to return but that seems to be working less and less most of the time i am unable to see who is calling what a text message says and i can not hardly use it to text to anyone the rest of the phone is in great condition but what good is all that when you can not even see it,146,16
2994,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,i purchased this from another store but it worked perfectly i could even talk across the room and it was comfortable wearing it for hours it could be worn on either ears and the hook could be molded to fit your ears curvature the only problem was that the hook broke overtime because of usage the headset still works,59,0
2995,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,this headset is great it is small and easy to use will purchase again if ever needed i have small ears and this headset actually fits very comfortably and does not feel like it is going to fall out all of the time,42,1
2996,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,this is not a bad little headset i picked it up cheap for use with my ps3 it pairs up easily and the sound quality is as good as any other headset I have used if i had to do it over again although i doubt i would buy this model for gaming there has no mute function which is not a must have but it is very convenient for coughing or answering a phone call the biggest downside is the aaaa battery aaaas pricey little buggers especially if you buy them in a retail store amazon sells a 6 pack for 6 that is the cheapest I have seen if you are looking for a ps3 headset you might want to have a look at the soon to be released socom headset it looks to be ideal for gaming as it should be,136,2
2997,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,1.0,negative,this head set paired quite easy with my motorola v3 but the aaaa battery is very very hard to find and expensive as i talked about 30 - 40 minutes with my cellular phone everyday i do not think i could afford to buy aaaa battery so frequently i am going to return it,52,3
2998,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,this is an excellent value works well with sufficient volume and never needs a charger paired with my samsung phone easily and the menu recognition works fine,26,4
2999,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,it is a decent product but i rather have a bluetooth with a charger instead of having to continually replace the battery,22,5
3000,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,1.0,negative,the one i received from unlockedcellphonekings came is a ziplock baggie and had a 3 month warranty this was at the very best a refurbished product,26,6
3001,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,1.0,negative,when i bought this headset a couple years ago it was the cheapest one on the shelf i assumed all bluetooth headsets were the same i should have read the fine print before i bought it the entire problem with this headset is that it uses an aaaa battery you read that right not triple-a quadruple-a these batteries are hard to find and expensive cheapest ones on amazon are still nearly 1 apiece good luck finding them if you run out while you are on the road oh and good luck finding rechargeable ones not to mention a charger that will work with them and you will have to feed them to this headset it will still work as the battery begins to drain but i found call quality dropped significantly after just a couple hours of use you will be able to make calls but there has no guarantee the people on the other end will be able to understand them but really the entire battery issue makes this an absolutely worthless product if you use a headset a lot you would spend less money buying the most expensive headset you can find than if you get this one,197,7
3002,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,2.0,negative,not overly impressed with thispros cheap easy to connect to phone uses a regular 4a battery instead of a charger which i tend to misplace plus you do not hav to wait for it to charge if it is dead just pop in a new battery cons sound quality is low there is static on the line it is a bit heavy and awkward on the ear verdict wish i had just spent a bit more and gotten a nicer one,81,8
3003,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,this wireless bluetooth is exceptional for the cost the battery dies fast and i am having a difficult time finding this size battery aaaa in regular stores,25,9
3004,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,i needed a new cell phone and live in california and it is hands free here I am not big into needing an almighty phone and have been a virgin pre-paid user for some time now this headset will be left in my car to be used only when i am driving so it is 10 price was perfect for me i have had it for a month now and the battery is doing fine i did buy some spares and keep them in the glove box it took sometime to figure out how to turn it off but figured out that my cell tells me when i turn it off and on sound is good not great it fits my ear fine,120,10
3005,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,2.0,negative,spend the extra cash and buy a better one battery does not last for more than a couple calls,18,11
3006,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,3.0,neutral,it is great except it takes aaaa battery can not find much of those i wish it was rechargeble but other than that it is great,23,12
3007,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,4.0,positive,cheap and easy to pair was hoping that it was able to stream music over it but it can not be done,21,13
3008,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000UPBPUO,5.0,positive,inexpensive sound pickup good reception good light fit a little flimsy i do not really like things growing out of my ear but it comes in handy to roam,28,14
3179,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,i like the way this works but it is a bit bulky and hard to open i think thinner leather a smaller clip and an easier flap would improve things but it is still good,33,0
3180,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,the case seems well made but the little things are either not thought through or not manufactured to spec the fit overall is reasonably snug but since the bezel on the note is so thin there is precious little non-screen real estate on the sides and the case could have benefited from more stiffness in that area as it is it just bulges to the left and right the bottom strip also bulges in the middle the microphone on the note is a small hole on the bottom of the casing the case has a round piece punched out for it but it is not quite centered on the hole you have to wiggle the phone and/or stretch the leather from time to time to keep it open on the other hand the cutout around the usb / charger connector is huge at least three times it is width there is no i repeat no way to connect the earpiece or headphones to the top jack when the flap is closed apparently designers did not expect note owners to listen to music or the radio while the phone is in their pocket or to have a long conversation hands-free nothing that 5 minutes with an x-acto will not fix of course also this concerns only the vendor not the product prime members should not put their trust in the two-day shipping i ordered theon friday night received a shipping estimate for wednesday and it finally arrived on thursday six days can not count as two under any definition of the term,257,1
3181,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,does everything it said it would do nice leather case good protection for the phone case is black leather there are pockets for credit cards the case is constructed such that it allows all buttons and functions accessible,38,2
3182,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,to be perfectly fair this is technically a very good case offering high quality construction with plenty of functionality i actually found it nearly perfect on a recent trip to washington that being said i own the ceramic white galaxy note and this case actually stains the back battery cover right in the middle there is a pale dark stain from the interior of the case I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to my electronics and this is driving me nuts i actually had to order a new battery door from amazon again great case beware if you own the white note,105,3
3183,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,part of my normal routine in the morning is to get in my car and drive to work if you have a similar routine you will need to know that the maleon the back of the case that slides into the female groove on the belt clip pulled out of the back of the case there is a metal bushing that thethreads into the bushing pulled out as well i only had this case for 2 weeks when it happened i would not consider getting into my car to be abuse so i am hopeful that boxwave recognizes this to be a design flaw it may be that for the samsung note there needs to be more reinforcement i reported this to manufacturer over a week ago but still no response i have four more stars to apply to this review should they decide to do the right thing,152,4
3184,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,this case is a perfect fit for the galaxy note it is extremely attractive functional and protective I have already dropped it and it withstood the test excellent product i like the vertical flap because it comes with a removable clip the clip is handy but is easily removed so the case fits nicely in your pocket excellent product,58,5
3185,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,would be nice if the discription tells that it is not real leather i only bought this case by thinking that it is actual leather and the price not worthet at all hope it will be halpful for someone,35,6
3186,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,i bought this case twice at different times the first one had a problem as a snap in the back was cracked only a month of use i then ordered the second one in hopes that the first one had been defective however the second one only lasted a few weeks as the case did not fit my phone completely it looked so weird as the case appeared too small for the phone finally i had to take it off from the phone for a better look this case is overpriced with the design and bad quality of this case the listing price for this case is not worth it,110,7
3187,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,i found the case to be very well constructed and it looks great the case is well padded but the phone in the case is still very thin and close fitting the only two things i would change is first have an opening for the headphones to plug into and second the opening for the volume on the left side will never line up properly and it always is a bother but i never give up so the simple fix was i removed my phone pushed the top of the leather opening up and inward putting a small amount of super glue in the crease and it is out of the way it does not effect the looks at all and it is easy to use the volume rocker button i found all of the other openings lined up perfectly please remember that with all leather cases you must seat the phone properly in the case this could be corrected at the factory but i do love the case i ordered this from amazoncom by next day delivery and as always i received it the next afternoon this is why i use amazoncom so often they always deliver as they promise and everything is well packed and in perfect condition,210,8
3188,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,this is a great case for my samsung note unfortunately i got an extended battery so now it does not fit but if i ever go back to a normal battery i have this in my drawer ready to go,39,9
3189,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,i understand that this case was really designed for the international version of the note but it really is I shall fitting for the most part not a great deal of thought seemed to have gone into things like the audio jack and mic openings i could have lived with all that but what i can not abide is the fact that it broke within a month what good is genuine leather if the plastic components are cheap the piece that screws into the case and holds the belt clip broke rendering it useless to me would have gotten more use out of the 30 by using it as tp,108,10
3190,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,initially looks excellent after five weeks clip started getting loose after eleven weeks clips got broken while getting into car needs to have a better clip for 30 i would not buy similar product unless has a decent return policy,42,11
3191,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,great price for a great product shields my phone from the elements and love the old school belt clip it even has a spot to store memory great job,29,12
3192,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,i purchased thisbased on the excellent review i read on amazon i used it for maybe a week and i noticed that the clip would not keep it in place especially when in the car and getting out it dropped a couple of times inside of the car but when i got out of the car one day and dropped on the asphalt i realized that it does not fully protect the phone from the bottom the other thing with it is a described by others that you can not use a corded earphone to listen to music or to talk becuase the way the flap on the case is it will not allow you you would have to keep the flap open then it would not serve it is purpose,127,13
3193,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,unfortunately i can not use this case because i can not use my phones volume rocker whenever I am on a call it is very annoying that i have to take the phone completely out of the case whenever i need to make or receive a call this is not to say that there has no opening in the case for the volume rocker in fact there is an opening for the volume rocker the problem is that the opening is not big enough and/or it is not properly aligned so whenever i try to use the volume rocker it simply does not work because the case is always in the way very annoying,105,14
3194,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,you have to be kidding me thisis at best a 2 to 3 star product it is not high grade in any way but really when you have a product as large as the note and are thinking about attaching it to your belt you should be shot anyway fashion disaster,52,15
3195,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,this is a great case in theory but the design is just not there it does not fit the note in a snug manner so you are constantly having to move it around to gain access to the power and volume buttons additionally the four buttons on the front face home backare partially covered by the case making it difficult to use would not have been a big deal but when i wrote customer service i received absolutely no response at all whatsoever fortunately i contacted amazon directly and they gave me 100 of my money back and allowed me to return the case i still have not heard anything at all directly from this vendor although,118,16
3477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,the elegant design metallic case quality display overall operability of the phones standard communications and convenience features and even an amazingly clear built-in speaker should please any user not inclined toward heavy text-messaging or web-surfing and all of this pleased me until my phone stopped working after 2 months instead of starting up it just began flashing a white screen for a few seconds got a replacement and 2 months later that phone died an identical death ordered a new replacement as this was mandatory given my mobile service agreement and in 2 more months I shall get back with you getting back with you phone just broke again same problem although this time it lasted an amazing 4 months worse news is t-mobile is forcing me to take a fourth one before i can upgrade to something that may actually endure for awhile my fifth replacement phone is on the way can not wait,152,0
3478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,the sierra wireless card is flimsy and has defects there is some glitch that when it updates it is software it kills the wireless unit I have had 4 of these replaced now the biggest rip off of all is that sprint warehouse says it is does nt receive them back and sprint charges you 100 after 15 days this time i mailed it back with postal certification to prove it was received by them sprint customer service says they acknowledge there has a problem but they have to just send the information higher into their management chain i also had a sprint lotus phone widely known for being defective and yet sprint still sells them to this day sprint has ripped me off bottom line I am posting this as a warning to others avoid sprint,131,1
3479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,if i did not have a contract I had cancel and find another way to get internet service i really really hate this broadband service i like in a city so there is not reason for the terrible service i get level of connection is given in percentages 0 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 the only place I have ever gotten 100 was in an airport at my house it is frequently at 0 or 10 most commonly at 40 at 40 you can not watch video you have to have at least 60 for that which i rarely get i called sprint and someone actually told me that they can not guarantee service inside where the he shall else am i going to use the internet on my roof my contract is up next year i think and after 5 years with sprint i am going to change providers i want to have an internet connection that works consistently in my house and if they sent me and countless others a product that they can not guarantee will work in the place that most people use it then i am finished with sprint,190,2
3480,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,3.0,neutral,i got this phone to replace an old one after trying many other phones whose battery life was not what i expected i like the phone except that it has dust under the screen can not really see much of the screen out of doors or in the sunlight because of the dust called t-mobile who will not replace it because it is out of their 30 day warranty and nokia told me to go to t-mobile the phone is only 4 months old so I am not real happy probably would not purchase another nokia,90,3
3481,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,1.0,negative,do not buy this phone i bought this phone 3 weeks ago through t-mobile and the screen on the front has cracked i did not drop it or put pressure on it it was sitting on my table and when i flipped the phone open it was cracked now i can not see who is calling or the time to fix it will cost over 70 and to replace it will cost me over 100 not worth it,77,4
3482,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,i rather like this phone the internal screen is very impressive however the phones reception is not that good I have tested 2 different t-mobile phones in the same area and this phone has the worse reception the phone is very good-looking it does not look durable although the keys do not feel comfortable if you text a lot they are not very responsive so you can not type very fast,67,5
3483,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,3.0,neutral,this is a pretty good standard flip phone come with the usual camera but this has flash photo quality is not too bad but what can you really expect from a cell phone built in mp3 player and radio need the antenna headset which is provided both that cam be played through the speakerphone built in bluetooth an expandable micro sd slot a button on the side of the hinge that opens the flip phone for you and mini usb connectivity to your computer wire did not come with my phone it has a few games that come with the phone but they are all demos the only problem I have come across for me at least is the hinge i had bought the phone on 3/28/09 and the side of the hinge cracked about a month later some may say that i had dropped the phone i can assure you that it has never happened right now I am in contact with nokia since t-mobile will not replace my phone because it is was over their 30 day policy i notified them on the 32nd day i was two days away my review will be updated once i get an answer from nokia regarding my problem other than that the phone was been great for me the 1 month I have had so far update ok nokia replaced my phone and it was covered under warranty customer service was really nice and kind to me over all i had a good repair experience one one gripe although i sent them my original phone box and in return i got back my phone in a flat rate box from the postal office i would think as a multi billion dollar company that they would return my box it is just something minor rating stays as is,302,6
3484,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,this modem replaced my sierra 597 that kept dropping signal in an unreliable sprint 3 g service area this 598 modem is much more stable and with the external antenna connection gives me 4 - 5 bars of signal strength it is connected to a cradlepoint wireless router that makes our rural home a great hotspot and downloads movies to the roku box,60,7
3485,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,perfect product high quality can not go wrong with this product as i have used it for 2 years and have had no problems,21,8
3486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,3.0,neutral,I have used one of these for about 6 months it is not as fast as they make it about to be or so i thought for the past 6 months i used it in airports hotels and more and it is definitely not high speed at times it seemed like a fast dial up service does anyone remember those days however last week i treated myself to an ipad and bought a cradlepoint portable router phs 300 a great little device that allowed me to attach the 598u so that i would not have to fork over another 30 to at t the speed has tripled since setting it up through the cradlepoint device not just for the ipad but for my laptop so if you want to see any decent speed you will have to spend another 100 best news i was able to get the wifi ipad which saved me 130 on that,149,9
3487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,lots of great features but it takes about 20 minutes worth of swearing and yanking to get the back cover off that means good luck getting to the micro sd card and the usb is not a standard shaped port when you are trying to get the cover off it likes to pull up random functions like voice recognition so then you have to stop what you are doing and exit out then when you get back to business it starts randomly calling people the nifty screen on the outside is delicate mine broke in my pocket you can not save received photos and videos to sd other than that pretty good but when you are dealing with one of it is weaknesses you will blow your top,122,10
3488,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,i have had mobile broadband through sprint for three years it was finally time to get a new modem and i chose this one i am sorry i did it gets no reception inside or outside of my house this little modem is getting sent back to sprint as soon as possible,49,11
3489,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,I have had wireless from sprint for 6 years now never have i had a problem traveled down the entire east coast and only dropped service once even worked well in the mountains i just recently upgraded to this modem works just as well had a higher rated modem for two days from sprint but had problems returned it and got this one instead had no issues with sprint this works well and would highly recommend it is cheaper than home based internet and less problems and better service,88,12
3490,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,4.0,positive,i have this card and it works ok the service where i am in tucson gives me about 40 to 60 percent i did buy a antennae from [ ] and it works awesome with this card it is a booster antenna w / cables for sierra aircard 598u i get 80 100 percent with the antenna plugged in,56,13
3491,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,i do not know what the previous reviewers expectations are but the device will only work as well as the service connection for your area i live in an area where we had only dial up or satellite for internet available to us until this and let me tell you the blazing speeds i get with this comparatively make it well worth it to me in a rural area i think within about a mile of the tower i get consistently 2 mb coverage it works perfectly runs probably easily 12 hours / day and I have had it for 10 months the only time it has gone down everything in my area is down including landline and cell phones actually that happened a couple days before thanksgiving everything was down but my sierra wireless was still delivering dial up speed connection,142,14
3492,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,5.0,positive,so I am the type of person who really takes care before making a purchase such as a cell phone because i intend to own it until it is no longer workable however i bought this phone back in november on a bit of a whim because my old cell phone which endured for more than three years had finally broken to the point of no return and i love it it is modern easy to use five-fave compatible and offers a lot more space for storing pictures and music than my previous phone the camera takes nice pictures the sound is good if you are looking to hear a little music and your ipod is dead and there are really cool pre-set themes you can choose from my only contention is that the flip action is not especially smooth but I am used to the slider phone i had for three years before this happy cell phone hunting,154,15
3493,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001QFZKN0,2.0,negative,got this phone through our cell phone provider and the screen has a noticeable crack in it now only 2 months young we were told that this is sturdy but can not figure out how the inner screen cracked although the outer plastic did not and it was not dropped either not made as well as older nokia phone models seems to have cheaper plastic very disappointed we would not recommend this phone due to it is lack of quality materials,74,16
3494,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,i bought an htc tilt 2 when replacing a blackberry bold 9000 end of contract / changing to a new phone it was the flavor of choice and had a number of things i wanted i had it for three weeks of the time all the windows features worked fine did not have difficulty with freezes or other things that people reported i set up my email and it failed numerous times would not automatically send / receive without going thru hoops anything sent was visible for 1and anything received was also visible for 1there was no auto-delete function invoked i was on the phone with at t for 6 hrs over the course of the last two weeks they agreed there was a problem i took it into an at t store where their store management reproduced the problems down to the last one and said he agreed too lacking the email function this smart phone is not such a smart phone and not worth the box it came in i replaced it paying the difference in with a blackberry torch I have now had it 3 weeks the torch and have had zero problems and have not had a need to call tech support not even once one other thing that should be changed the keys and the backlighting make for difficult use of the keys unless the room is dim keyor backlightshould be changed good luck with your purchase or find something else,251,0
3495,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,this is a really good device i have had many cellphones and pdas and this is one of the best ones i have ever had it is durable has good battery life and an easy to use qwerty keyboard the tilting action makes it easy to see what you are typing with no glare the video resolution is good and sd card makes it as expandable as you want you can switch out cards if you start running out of room or want to keep some files private i highly recommend this device i have used it in a busy medical practice loaded with references and resources and with the google mobile apps bar i am on the internet in a flash and can access the web or my google apps luckily it is pretty much drop proof,138,1
3496,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,4.0,positive,as the title suggests i consider this smartphone to be a good work horse a previous poster listed a few features on this device I have expanded some of the detail on that and added some other info tether as a modem very helpful and less expensive than buying a standalone aircard full keyboard there is a soft keyboard you can type on without having to slide out the keyboard everytime you need to type something can open edit save microsoft office files word powerpointon an iphone you can only view not edit screen tilts helpful to reduce glare create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking without additional cost helpful tips for windows mobile periodically windows mobile devices experience registry corruption the best resolution is to perform a hard reset on the device clearing out the memory and essentially freshly building the device by doing these periodic resets in my experience 2 times a year is necessary the device remains responsive and less buggy there is a lot of functionality built into the tilt that is handy it is one of the better windows devices for navigation using a bluetooth gps bug the device can do quite well guiding without the necessity of having to buy a singletasking handheld navigation system,226,2
3497,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,this phone stinks i doubt i will buy another htc product it has been nothing but problems since i purchased it at a much higher price i can not wait to replace it,33,3
3498,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,why buy these 250 phones and get stuck with a 2-year contract when the phone does not last even a year it is almost like bait and switch by at t they stop carrying the particular expensive phone in less than a year so when the phone dies in a few months at t will not have to exchange it with a new one for you but they got your contract for 2 years with a cheaper phone in exchange before wasting your money on a new expensive at t smartphone ask yourself if you are ok with having to warranty exchange your new phone with a used refurbished one in less than a year,108,4
3499,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,5.0,positive,i had one just like this before someone robbed me so i know what i was buying yeah this is not an iphone or a new phone with android but with a few hints you can make of this old smartphone it was released in 2007 works pretty damm well i install the windows mobile 65 and the performance of the phone improves a lot much faster without freezes I have installed a cooked version of the phoenix iii with touchflo i have the newest opera mobile garmin xt foursquare youtube and the performance is quite well the battery life is acceptable using wifi or the 3 g networks 1 day fully charged I am from chile and the purchase and shipping were faster and without problems,124,5

3501,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,1.0,negative,it usally takes a lot of headache before i leave a bad review I have had my share with this phone I have been fighting with it since about july of 2010 since my previous tilt was having problems it was pretty old but it worked i thought that replacing it with a tilt 2 would be a greatwrong the tilt 2 is / has slow locks up freezes all the time poor keyboard layout stupid magnet in stylus really I had like to slap the engineer that thought of this you will see the issue when you have got a case with a magnetic catch will not work with my redfly thanks a lot m voice dial / command is a joke and a bad one at that predictive typing is nonexistant pokcket ie another bad joke it is horrible pocket outlook crashes or freezes all the time sometimes it just stops working and does not get new email so htc and micro oft you did a great job converting me to be android user an no i will not be replacing it with a winmob 7 phone,187,7
3502,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,2.0,negative,I have had and loved other htc phones this one does not live up to it is brand at all i bought two for my girls this past christmas and they have had nothing but problems despite being long time cell phone users part of the problem is the crappy windows software but even if that was not a pita the hardware is already falling apart and it is just mid-january the tilt feature broke the first week in one of them i bought extra batteries for them and it is a good thing because the battery life is almost non-existent also they are very bulky so if you want a fairly light or small phone this is not it,115,8
3503,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001TL0Z72,4.0,positive,phone is a very good a bit heavy but makes up for it is speed and keyboard very adaptable to large fingers very good buy maybe buy one for a friend,30,9

3510,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,i used this product to install a clarion cx-501 into a 2010 chev colorado this product did it is job and lined up well in the truck,26,1
3511,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this mounting kit worked well for the jvc double din hd i installed in my colorado it took a couple of reads through the manual as it is not extremley detailed to understand the mounting take your time and inspect the factory mounting you have to remove a number of the plastic tabs from the side mounts it did fit well and secure once screwed in note removing the faceplate on the colorado to access the stereo was easy look for it on you tube,85,2
3512,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,face plate did not fit it was too small for the pyle pldd75bg 7 in double din for my 2005 express cargo van check the metra site and it said this kit was for my van only used the side mounts to hold the pyle in the dash,48,3
3513,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i ordered this to use in a 2003 chevy tracker the faceplate would not fit with the trackers original dashboard radio cover but it did fit the boss 822ua in-dash double-din cd / mp3 receiver with front panel aux input usb sd card that i was putting in the tracker not using the mounting kit faceplate was no big deal the radio fit in the dash nicely and looks fine with just the original dashplate the mounting brackets had many different mounting variations and naturally noone of them lined up exactly right i drilled some holes to make them attachable to the radio then decided if I am going to drill holes i might as well drill them in the mounting brackets from the stock radio which i know will match the mounting holes in the front of the dash so i did long story short i gave this 3 stars because it was not a bad piece of equipment but it was not compatible out of the box with the 03 tracker even although when i looked it up it stated it was,179,4
3514,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,bought this adapter for my new head unit in my 2006 isuzu ascender and it did not fit it also does not fit together properly but even if it did it still would not fit waste of 15,35,5
3515,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,it does what it describes one gripe i have although is that the screws used to attach the headunit do not have any tooling so you must use a wrench and some elbow grease i do not see any significant security in this because if a thief wants you radio he can just as easily take the mounting bracket with it only way i can see improving this product is to make the screws an allen or flathead or something,79,6
3516,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it said i could fit this in my car when i looked it up on amazon i ordered this and found out after putting in the new radio that it did not fit my chevy trailblazer 05 u might get lucky but do not count on it even if the page says it will fit,53,7
3517,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,center bezel did not fit the stereo kenwood dpx502bt i even dremeled it out to be as large as possible still too small i ended up just mounting the side brackets directly to the head unit with some screws i had laying around and tossing the bezel in the trash be aware that the plastic side brackets are made out of fairly thick and hard plastic it can not be cut with a utility knife as stated in the directions you will need a cut-off wheel on a small rotary tool or possibly something like a jewelers saw to remove whatever mounting tabs are not for your vehicle,104,8
3518,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fit perfect with my new pioneer app radio 4 for reference i have a 07 chevy colorado,17,9
3519,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,fit in my 2008 chevy colorado perfectly 1 star for risking breaking it to cut the other model tabs,19,10
3520,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,received kit it came with two right sides so i had to take a dremmal and make it fit said it would for my car stereo unit it did not had to grind the cheap ass plastic down made it work but it took forever,44,11

3524,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,not the best fit with my jvc head unit but i did manage to beat on my rodeos faceplate / dash and got it to at least look like it fit properly laughing out loud,31,15
3525,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,brackets worked fine after alot of cutting the faceframe did not fit although fortunately i did a pretty good job installing my radio so did not need it,26,16
3526,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,fits the truck 2005 trailblazer but would not fit my kenwood ddx3 had to custom mount it materials were pretty cheap and instructions were terrible,25,17
3527,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,cheapo but if you are careful and know what you are doing you can make this work,15,18
3528,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the side plates probably would have worked if the tabs i need had not broke while trying to cut off the tabs that are not needed as directed by the instructions one had no room around it for using a razor blade knife it was the last tab i had to do and a few needed tabs were very close to it that they ended up being broken off i am not sure how i could have been more careful,78,19
3529,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this was exactly what i needed to have to put my double din in my 2003 malibu it even had a factory finish on it that matched perfect with my vehicle interior great product fits perfect looks great,38,20
3530,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,worked great and easy to use once you figure out which tabs to remove product seems flimsy but looks to be rigid enough for it is intended purpose make sure to read the manual first,34,21
3531,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fits my radio installation in my 2005 suburban just be careful when cutting the tabs if you make a mistake you will have to order another kit,27,22

3533,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,once installed correctly this works great and for a good price despite reading reviews saying to be careful about cutting the rights tabs i cut too many and ruined it on one side i had to order a second one good thing they are cheap,45,24
3534,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,works for chevy silverado 1500 hd read and follow the directions and it works well with no rattles or squeaks,20,25
3535,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i ordered a weird sized radio from japan and had to do some resizing with my dremel but all in all it worked out good,25,26
3536,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,should be made from a little stronger material,8,27
3537,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the tabs do not break easily and then when they do you my break anothe you wanted to keep,18,28
3538,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,the only thing i dislike about it is the sides do not snap in securely it would have worked great except amazon misinformed me that the stereo i bought would fit my 06 chevrolet silverado this caused me to accidentally break on side of the bracket,45,29
3539,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,i bought this to install my pioneer appradio into my 2007 chevy silverado 2500 classic body install was straight forward but the head unit sit too low i probably remove and tried to adjust the unit at lease 4 - 5 times with no luck my cousin with the simlar setup with a apline head unit has the same issue,58,30
3540,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,extremely cheap i have installed many stereos and this broke within two days,13,31
3541,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,one of the great pains in the ass of my life you have to carefully saw away all the pieces you do not need to make it work for your particular mount i get it metra can not release a million different variations but seriously some kind of perforations or something would have been so helpful so much work on the consumer end but it got my stereo mounted in the end so thanks but metra you should perforate it make it so much easier,83,32
3542,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,not for the average joe requires a lot of cutting and fitting to make it useful unuseable tabs have to be cut with a saw instead of simple break off,30,33
3543,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,works as advertised on my 04 siverado was kind of pain to break off all the tabs could be a bit more solid,23,34
3544,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,needed a lot of modification to fit just have some tools handy i was not upset because the fit is perfect now but it is not a direct install,27,35
3545,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,perfect after-marketfinish for the 2005 toyota sienna,9,36
3546,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i purchased this to use on a 2003 chevy silverado having to break off the unnecessary tabs based on unclear instructions was not ideal but once i got it modified as outlined in instructions it fit ok there has still a smallbetween this and my factory trim if i were to do this again i would buy a different brand,61,37

3548,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,it works however the curve of the bezel does not match the trim at the top of the bezel where it meets the dash on my 2008 gmc sierra 1500 wt,30,39
3549,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,just like any dash kit from walmart this is terrible quality breaking the tabs i needed to to make it fit the holes was very hard but breaking the ones i needed to keep by accident was all too easy i do not recommend this or sosche,46,40
3550,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,screw holes do not line up right i had to buy a different one,13,41
3551,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,as other reviewers have noted you have to cut a lot of tabs off the kit in order to install it and the directions were not completely correct for my 2003 gmc envoy however it was not hard to figure out what to do and the installation looks good,48,42
3552,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,nothing in this kit works on a 2002 suburban,9,43

3555,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,i bought this to help install an aftermarket radio on a 96 buick regal if you follow instructions which are clear enough it is easy to install and does exactly what it says it will do you do have to cut off a lot of tabs but it is relatively soft plastic and very easy to do,57,46
3556,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,poor fitment for my 2003 tahoe the radio was not centered in the dash bezel right and there was aabout 1/8th inch between the dash kit and bezel there are no adjustments on this kit so i ended up cutting and plastic welding a lot on this to make it right,52,47
3557,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it says it works for chevy avalanche but it do does not line up at all,16,48
3558,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,i had to cut pieces of it to fit in 2002 crv way to much work trying to figure it out,21,49
3559,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this is one of the cheapest easiest kits that can be purchased fit exactly as it was supposed to and i did not even need to read instructions great durability has been installed for years now with zero issues i recommend it,42,50
3560,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,i bought this as it was reccomended to fit a 2004 chevy silverado i guess sure it fits in the sense that the radio is held in there however the radio pushes against the trim and none of the supplied screws worked it is held in place by one bolt on a silverado all over i would not buy this kit for any vehicle spend the extra few bucks for a better version this one is terrible cheap plastic worse instructions i had to cut some tabs off to test mount it so without even putting it in to see if it fits i can not return it garbage steer clear,108,51
3561,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,it is kind of difficult to cut off the tabs if fit my 03 avalanche but it did not fit the double din stereo,23,52
3562,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,this is the second time I have bought one of these and the second time I have had to get my drill and pocket knife out to make it work they are chevy trucks they are not that rare,35,53
3563,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,makes the radio sit too low in my 2005 suburban the display hits dash trim when it opens and closes using pioneer x5700bhs,23,54
3564,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,this kit is terrible in a 2004 escalade the radio did not clear the bottom and sits about an 8th inch out,21,55
3565,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fit the car dash and new stereo perfectly my son is very happy,13,56
3566,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,be sure to buy a saw and sandpaper at the same time have to cut off most of the tabs and cut and sand to make it fit,28,57
3567,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,equipment was as described and was exactly what was needed,10,58
3568,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,works great but it is not intended for a rookie to install these require quite a bit of customization to make them fit perfectly there are not any better options so purchase with the understanding that if you do not know what you are doing it will fit like crap if you are slightly handy then get after it you will be fine,61,59
3569,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,easy to assemble and install breaking the tabs that was not going to be used was not tricky either some people cut them but i find it easier to get it completely assembled bolted down and then break the useless tabs off carefully bending back and forward until it breaks leaving a smooth flat surface make sure you know the tabs you need to keep,63,60
3570,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,this installation kit was pretty bad it said in the manual and on amazon that it fit my car but it certainly did not i had to cut all the corners off and remove the face place for it to fit so double check the manual before buying I am sure it is on metras website somewhere do not just assume that since amazon says it fits it will fit also there are many pieces on the mounting brackets the side pieces that you will not need so it will instruct you to cut the unneeded pieces off yeah right maybe superman can cut that but this thing is made out of the hardest plastic imaginable what i did is took a lighter and melted the parts i needed to cut so they were soft and easy to cut it will stink like melting plastic but at least you will be able to cut it,146,61
3571,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,clockwork install flawless i have yard metra in the past and will use again,14,62
3572,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,another cheap mounting bracket you have to break off tabs to use,12,63
3573,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i got the job done it is plastic not metal,9,64
3574,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it is a double dinn what ever it is for,8,65
3575,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,way overpriced for three pieces of plastic that you have to cut up per instructions to fit your specific vehicle for this price i should have been able to select my specific vehicle and get exactly the mount that fit it instead i had to take a japan blade and cut off five of the six tabs specific to my vehicle also it comes with no mounting screws and neither did my new jensen receiver so now i have to order specific metric screws to make it work installing this new receiver has turned into a week long process,99,66
3576,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,the frame was usable for my 2006 gmc-envoy retrofit project but it took some engineering to cut off all the stuff that was in the way and not cut off too much and a minute later you regret it sounds simpler than it was in practice it came with documentation but it is very poor i understand the cost of printing a decent manual would be prohibitive but why not have higher-quality installation images on their website,78,67
3577,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this made installing the new boss head unit we got for christmas super easy the head unit would not have fit with out it,23,68
3578,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,works great with double din touchscreen reciever in my 2005 silverado,11,69
3579,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,although it said it would fit my year car it really did not so I am a bit disappointed but i managed to force fit it,24,70
3580,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,side mounts worked good with some hole modifications no mounting screws were included,13,71
3581,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,works great besides one side of the mounting bracket was cracked an it did not mount right,16,72
3582,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,excellent product fast shipping great seller highly recommended,8,73
3583,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,according to metra this should have fit my vehicle i bought this for a 2003 tahoe and it did not line up to the holes on the dash i destroyed it trying to make it work wasted money,38,74
3584,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,left a smallat top of stereo but holds it in place,13,75
3585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,instructions a little difficult but figured it out,8,76
3586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,was broken when i received it and made of very cheap plastic would definitely not recommend this just spend the money and get a better product,27,77
3587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,unfortunately thisdoes not comply to the iso double-din standard as well as one would hope the standard width is supposed to be 180 mm my head unit has a big screen in addition to knobs that go right up within 1/32 of theof the unit this metra harness does not fit over the knobs which are inside the overall profile they do not stick out so there has no way to get the bracket onto the head unit the head units listed width is 180 mm which comes out to about 7 3/32 inches i measured this kits internal window width to be about 6 13/16 close but no cigar it is worth noting that many american manufacturers modify the iso measurements to be 7 x 4 taking that into account 6 13/16 is not an egregious miscalculation likely an intentional decision to make the mount fit right up against the control interface of american-made head units which may have some black space around the edges with my japanese head units strict compliance to the iso standard and controls extending right up to thethere has just not room in this bracket just make sure that your head unit will fit in this bracket and you should be golden seems to be made of your standard hard plastic kinda close to abs but not quite and of solid quality manual provides lots of cars and different installation instructions which tabs to cut off for each one,244,78
3588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,just as the description said it would be cheaper that the stores too,13,79
3589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,slots where not aligned with stereo but it did a good job not bad at all,16,80
3590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,the quality was not the greatest and the fit could have been a little better mounting but it worked and looked ok oddball adjustments had to be rigged,27,81
3591,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,it fits perfect in my 2004 monte carlo a little cheap but it did the trick for my pioneer avh-4700bs,20,82
3592,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used this on a 2008 trailblazer and it fitted perfectly a little fragile so we are going to order another one but it is exactly what we wanted,27,83
3593,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this dash kit worked perfectly for our pioneer avhx-5700bhs in our 2005 chevrolet tahoe,14,84
3594,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,this fit and worked well it would be nice if it were aluminum or something more rigid but after install and trim reinstalled it looks factory,26,85
3595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used this on my 1995 buick roadmaster wagon to install a blaupunkt new jersey 220 double din yes you have to take a lot of tabs off but if you follow the instructions and use the stock radio as a guide it really works well i would recommend this to anyone with my car,53,86
3596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,i was happy that i even ordered the correct one for my car however i had to break almost every single tab on each side made me think why can not they just make different ones instead of one why should i pay for it and still have to do all the work it is like the last guy on the assembly line quit that day so this also would not stay clipped in on the side and left too much open space on the top and bottom thank god i have a heavy bag after installing with this,96,87
3597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,for the inexperienced may prove difficult to work with knowledge of what you can an can not do helps greatly,20,88
3598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this works like it should it is the double din install that turned out to be a nightmare do yourself a favor and cut the metal bracket behind the radio or your new radio will never fit kit or no kit i hesitated and tried everything and finally cut it and perfect looks so good,48,89
3599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,not cool says it fits a 2006 chevy crew it do not very very disappointed same on you guys waited to get it had everything removed ready to install and the dash will not fit tight so there is a,40,90
3600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,dis not fit with my 2007 buick rainer or the ssl touch screen,13,91
3601,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,bought this kit for my 2003 yukon and my 2004 avalanche and both had the same problems since the radios and dash are exactly the sameon the top and bezel can not lock since radio is not in the proper location i think the slots on the double din are cut wrong from left to right or the tabs were put wrong on the left and right plates i just decided to modify the side slots so the radio moves up putting it in the proper location because this is my 2nd kit and it has the same exact problem metra please look into this and let us know what you find i can add photos of problems and what i did to correct it if needed or wanted,130,92
3602,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,it is a multi-kit as such there has enough variability in it that it will probably work fine for your application a couple of items to keep in mind although first off after it is in it is secure enough just do not expect a rock-solid mounting typically the plastic has some give to it so you will have to persuade it into the position you need this can be a positive of course as that bit of flexibility will be what you will need to mount your unit squarely second the tabs are not pre-cut or scored since it is a multi-kit you will have to remove the majority of tabs that come on the brackets i used a plastic welder to just slice them off you will be fine using either a small saw or jigsaw just remember that you will not be able to just snap these off this is really what makes it better than most multi-kits I have used before if you want to get a higher level of quality you will have to get something application specific but for 95 of us this should be more than enough,181,93
3603,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,arrived earlier than expected and fits my 03 trailblazer perfectly,10,94
3604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,could be easier to install but it did work,9,95
3605,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,does not fit a double din radio sorry i could not give it less than 1 star,15,96

3607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,really good product am very happy thank you,8,98
3608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,the only drawback of this adapter is that they try to cover too many vehicles with one kit you end up cutting away 75 of the plastic to just use what mates up with your application it worked but could have been a little better if it were designed for my 1995 buick roadmaster exclusively,55,99
3609,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,you have to cut off pieces and the instructions are horrible before you cut off uneeded pieces get the radio out and really look at everything well you can not rely on the horrible instructions which only clearly show one side really stupid,42,100
3610,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this thing is a quick way to mount the stereo it is not bomb proof but does the trick,18,101
3611,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,worked perfectly with my toyota matrix 2004 the manual even includes instructions for toyota matrix and pontiac vibes 2003 and 2004 even although amazon displayed a message stating it does not fit a toyota matrix 2004,35,102

3616,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,was as expected needs some adjustments and plastic is fragile if you know anything about installing radios than this will work fine if you do not maybe want to get an extra backup because you ll probablly crack / break it,36,107
3617,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this kit was a pain in the but to install but once i got everything clipped of it worked great only reason i am giving it 3 stars is because the instructions told me to leave certain things on and then when i tried to put it in i had to clip like 6 more things off other then that it worked great,63,108
3618,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,for what it is it works it is plastic and has a little give to it if you need it just remember that it actually is made for many different vehicles in a wide year range so you will have to dremel / break off specific pieces of it to fit your vehicle i used it to install a radio for the first time after researching how to do it being a novice for audio installation it took me a little bit to figure out you actually had to break pieces off of it for it to work properly ah well that is my fault and not the product vehicle installed in was a 2001 chevy malibu,113,109
3619,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,metra makes kits for almost every make and model car out there this one was for a cadillac escalade and a pioneer avic-z build quality is good and installation was straightforward it really depends on the head unit and the car but the metra kits include everything you need to make it happen i used the screws that came from the factory hu so make sure you keep those if you are doing an aftermarket hu install you most definitely should use metra,83,110
3620,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,fits perfect directions are simple and to the point spacers where needed for the radio to match up with the dash,21,111
3621,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,i used this kit to install a double din pioneer dvd player it worked perfectly i have installed about 10 different cd and dvd players in various cars and trucks this kit is great quality and the included instructions were well written highly recommended,44,112
3622,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,unless you really need a super universal adapter do not get this it says it will fit a 2004 envoy but it will also fit about a dozen other vehicles i had to cut off all the other fittings before it would fit in the mount hole although it did have the correct mounting tabs,54,113
3623,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,this was used to install a double din radio in my 2002 chevy trailblazer i did not need 98 of the kit only parts i needed were the side tabs shown in the picture they bolt directly to my radio with no surround if i used the surround i would have had to cut up the factory fascia panel to accommodate that surround piece i decided against that and blacked out the metal mounting cage for the aftermarket radio instead amazon is the only way to go with this kit because the kit is dirt cheap buying in a store it can cost upwards of 2500 or more parts worked flawlessly,111,114
3624,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,it does not work on 08 silverado it says 90 and up but only goes to early 07 model will not work on new body style,26,115
3625,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,it is ok but i broke it trying to install it a little flimsy and need need seven more words to finish this review but that is all i have to say,30,116
3626,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,well i accidentally ordered this one when i ordered the metra 70 - 1858 wiring harness for gm 88 - 2005 vehicles the wiring harness worked perfectly but this thing was a pain in the rear-end to get those tabs to break off i gave up and ended up ordering the metra 95 - 2001 instead and it worked perfectly,54,117
3627,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,i got it the same day i got my hu pretty darn fast i must say very easy to install only minor cutting needed to be done to get the fit on my car the only thing i did not like too much about it is that it feels kinda like flimsy plastic granted once in place the hu feels sturdy and does not move around but it did not feel as strong when i first opened it from the box still is not a bad buy if your looking for a cheap installation kit,92,118
3628,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,it was a perfect fit it made the install look clean very easy to install it was a sterdy unit,20,119
3629,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,the plastic on this is very weak and one side broke when trying to screw it into my dash extremely poor quality you get what you pay for,28,120
3630,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,i purchased this because i surprised my wife with a new pioneer stereo / navigation system for her car clearly i need an after market install kit and this fit the bill it worked like a champ and did not break the bank,40,121
3631,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,bought this figuring it would work pretty good with the pioneer stereo i was putting wrong it did not fit in the hole right without breaking off the little wings on the sides to fill space it is not even big to fill the front space that gm has in the dash opening on the 2008 gmc sierra the mounting screw holes do not match up total waste should have measured,71,122
3632,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,you will pay twice as much for one of these kits at best buy to be honest this is not worth more than the 10 it is here on amazon it is just a few pieces of rather soft plastic i used this to install a jvc kwr500 into a chevy malibu 03 the directions are not the best i actually had to cut more of the plastic off than it shows in the manual for my install i cut off the plastic pieces i did not need but then i also took a dremel and smoothed down the areas where i had cut so nothing would catch the sides as i slid it into the dash for my install i did not need the front bezel if you get confused about what pieces to cut just take a look at your oem mounting pieces and see how they are aligned that should give you enough guidance to finish the job,155,123
3633,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,i used this kit for installing a double dinin my 2005 chevy colorado since theis made for so many different vehicles you have to cut off the plastic tabs off for whatever other vehicles you are not using it for which kind of sucks and is confusing at first also the instructions are not the greatest i had to read them over several times to make sure i was doing the right thing so i did not screw something up also when i was screwing the bracket into my dash the plastic cracked from the pressure it did fit and get the job done but next time i would pay a little extra for a better kit,120,124
3634,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,3.0,neutral,the old saying that you get what you pay for is so true it did the job however took a lot of manipulation to get it to work and you have to break off the unused tabs and be very very carefull to not break off the ones that you do need,51,125
3635,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,used this product to install pioneer avic z130 bt into a 2003 trailblazer the product provided the necessary side brackets for the mount i did have to remove two unused screw tabs as they were blocking my dash panel from going in i do not find this to be a defect when it works for so many different applications,59,126
3636,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,this installation kit worked out fine installing a pioneer avh-p4300dvd 7 in-dash double-din dvd av receiver with ipod / iphone control pandora head unit in my 2003 yukon xl denali only reason i did not give it five stars is the directions are a bit lacking they are definitely geared towards people who are already experienced installing stereos I have done about 15 in my life not the first timer the guide book leads you all over the book from one section to another and is not intuitive also the picture that shows you which tabs to remove for your vehicle is poor it is very difficult to tell in the small black and white drawing what is what in my case all but 2 or 3 of the tabs needed to be removed or cut off the side brackets it does not tell you how to do this but a set of wire cutters should do the trick they did not need to be perfectly flush in my case also one of the tabs was not needed but was not indicated for removal in fact the left bracket in the image only had two arrows but required about 8 or 9 tabs to be removed recommend you look at your dash before cutting and match their picture with what mounting holes you have available measure twice cut once,225,127
3637,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,1.0,negative,i bought this after looking at the price of the scosche gm1590ab and the price of this at half the price i figured no big deal i just ordered the scosche model because this one broke during installaion the break-off tabs broke off do not waste your money get the scosche product and save your timescosche gm1590ab double din kit with trim ring / iso for 1992-up general motors,69,128
3638,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,5.0,positive,this kit has it all installed mine in a chevy van and it worked like a charm good quality bracket hardware and manual included shows youbydirections going to buy another one again,36,129
3639,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,i used this product to install a kenwood dnx6960 double-din head unit into a 2004 gmc sierra the instructions were easy to follow the product did it is job well and i now have a clean / professional installation in my truck update three weeks after installation i had to remove my head-unit to do some under dash work while doin so i noted that the tab used to secure the unit to the dash had broken off from the right-hand ear i had not forced or jostled anything I have revised this review from 5 stars to two because the product is apparently made of brittle / flimsy plastic il be replacing it with something else,110,130
3640,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,do not ever order from boxwave i have to return myand they are impossible to get in contact with they do not respond to emails not a company interested in making the consumer happy,34,0
3641,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,the white version of this product produces a white haze on pictures taken with flash due to the cutout design it does not integrate with built in iphone functions such as auto correct and tapping space bar twice for period it is a great conversation starter and it does provide a full screen for typing but once you try to use it it makes for harder typing the trade off is not worth it why thiswas on back order for 3 weeks is beyond me the folks at apple had it right the first time,97,1
3642,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,I have had an ipod touch since it is release in 2007 so I have grown quite accustomed to the on screen keyboard of apple products but after i had such a good experience with the bluetooth keyboard for the ipad2 i own the zagg / logitech brand one i thought this maybe a goodwhile i do not hate the product i can honestly say I am not entirely satisfied pros the most obvious pro about this is that it is a full physical keyboard if you type in landscape mode then you already know how much screen real estate you lose when you are typing making it difficult to see having the physical keyboard gives you back all that screen space so really if you are big on text messaging you are totally going to dig this product the battery life of it is actually really good and you can go for quite some time without having to charge the thing considering the keys are backlit while typing this is a plus cons the construction of this product is pretty brittle the keyboard itself is not flush with the assembly and feels like if you were too rough with it the keyboard would fly right off another gripe i have is the placement of the buttons while it is a complete qwerty keyboard the problem likes in the key placement after extensive use you will come to the realization that you are force to shift your thumbs more to the right i found myself making more mistakes than i would like because of this but it is easily overcome with time and patience overall it is a goodreally like i said i do not hate the product it just feels like it could have been done a little bit better,287,2
3643,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,it is a neatfor iphone users who would like a qwerty keyboard unfortunately the one deal breaker was that with this on the phone it no longer can be docked i have yet to use the charging cable my iphone came with as i have docks all over the place to conveniently charge it on however with this I had have to remove it each and every time toit which is not too easy also what another reviewer said about the flash is absolutely right even while taking pictures with qwerty open the picture still comes out unclear and hazy other than these two reasons it is pretty great just not great enough for me also i think it is a bit pricey maybe half the cost would be good say 25ish,129,3
3644,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this keyboard case is the reason i got an iphone however it feels a little flimsy and they should recall it because pictures do not turn out when you use the flash i believe this only happens with the white case and not the black one it does not automatically capitalize or spellcheck but if you must have a physical keyboard then this is the one i recommend,67,4
3645,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,after receiving this in the mail i must say it is not what i thought it was going to be you are basically paying 63 for a plastic case that prevents you from using your flash and has poor key quality the keyboard works fine but the backlight is constantly going away and the keys themselves are very tiny i do not think this was worth what i paid I had say it is worth about 15 i would not recommend this product sending back tomorrow,81,5
3646,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,we bought these for our new iphones 4s and they perform as advertised for someone who is making the transition from a blackberry or other device with a keyboard the keyboard buddy is a nice add on positives include nice backlit keypad good size keys and easy to use function keys downsides include additional size and weight drain on battery life for the iphone although not as bad as feared and fact that use of keyboard seems to disable the auto spell check function on the phone all in all a good device for someone who uses their phone for a lot of e-mails,104,6
3647,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,just received the case fits nicely a little bulky and takes a little getting used to pushing the keys as they are a little tight when taking flash photography it does not work i think this problem may only be related to the white case as it is flashing back the white surrounding the camera / flash i tested my theory by placing black tape along the inside around the camera / flash and my rudimentary solution at best worked somewhat could not get the tape to fit exactly the picture was actually visible so if you want the prettiness of just plain white you are stuck with just taking non-flash photography or take the phone out of the case whenever you want to take flash photography which is easier said than done could be nail breaking in my case it would be nice if the manufacturer had the option of black on white,149,7
3648,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,the product looked fantastic online but i was not as happy with what i got the box was a bit bashed although it did come 2 days before expected delivery date and therefore was very prompt overall I had say it works great but has a few kinks auto correct does not work when using this and it is annoying to type on it when using an app that will not turn sideways also mine has the problem that if i do not use it often after about 4 - 5 hours of non-use the bluetooth disconnects and i have to reconnect it so this means that every night obviously not texting in my sleep so it is not being used the bluetooth disconnects also this happens during the day if i am not constantly using it very annoying although it has some problems i am quite pleased with the product and have gotten numerous comments on it people wondering what phone i have in fact i received a comment the first night having it at a restaurant so my point is it is quite a good conversation starter i would recommend buying it but only if you are okay with the problems i have mentioned other than those it is a great case quite easy to type on and the backlight is nice,217,8
3649,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,the keyboard itself is great keys are nice to type on love the shortcut keys backlight is great for typing in the dark but the major problem is that the cutout for the camera and flash causes the flash to create a haze in all photos you take with the flash on if that did not happen then i would have kept it sending it back to amazon now,67,9
3650,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,a gift for my grandson which he requested he liked it that / s all i can say about it so don know what else you want,25,10
3651,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,i bought this for my boyfriend to use with his new iphone because he is has a passionate hatred for touch screens but these days that is pretty much the only kind of smartphone available i was pleasantly surprised with the quality and the look of this case it was not nearly as bulky or awkward as i had expected and i like the keyboard layout space bar centered instead of off to the side it was easy to pair it with the iphone and the backlighting is pretty cool and he really loved the feel of the buttons the fact that they were raised and had a rubberized coating but then when he started using it we both noticed a problem with the s key at first it just seemed a little sticky and added a ton of s s whenever he touched it example thankssssssssssssssssss then a few hours later it just stopped working entirely he has been trying to just work with it anyway in hopes that it will just kinda fix itself but it has not yet and so i will probably most likely be returning soon for 70 i expect all keys to be functional,196,11
3652,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,this keyboard was probably the best purchase for my iphone that I have ever made it worked wonderfully and the keyboard was just the right size for me i will say that if you have bigger fingers then this product might not be for you but it never wore out and i type a lot of texts messages during the day the backlighting worked great as well the only thing that was tricky was knowing when to plug the keyboard in to charge but it did last me about 2 - 3 days and that is with it constantly being on and used very impressed and happy with this product even although i do not have that phone anymore,114,12
3653,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,i give it a three as i have not yet purchased this case but have all intentions of it i also think that a lot of the complaints are unfairly placed people complain of keys sticking andstains and stuff like that they also say the bluetooth does not work well these people also say how they let there kids play with there phone or they take it to school so obviously it is going to get some wear and tear also if the keys stick it should fall under the warranty i have contacted no wave and they got back to me later that day they have decent customer service if you have a little patience if the bluetooth messes up try resetting your phone fully charging your phone and the case and then attempt to reconnect them a friend of mine owns one and that usually works thank you for reading,153,13
3654,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this is a decent keyboard case but fell low on my expectations firstly this case can get dirtied really easily on the back do not put it next to any pens pencils markers or crayons even with the slightest dot of those and it will be on there permanently no matter how much you clean it even with a hard soap scrub secondly the led backlighting is a fail the light is only supposed to shine through the keys but the plastic the keys are placed in is very thin so you can see the lights glowing through the plastic everywhere in weird places giving a bade effect another problem with the led backlighting is that you have to press a key to light it up temporarily a better way to have the lights turn on and off is to have a trigger when you slide the keyboard in an out the problem i have with the above issue is that when i am in a dark place let us say at night in bed i can not see the keys so i have to press them randomly to light it up and then delete those characters i pressed again i have to repeat this process every few seconds when i want to type and pause and gets very annoying overall the keys are good and the case looks very appealing and are responsive i like the integrated lock and home buttons in the keyboard too,244,14
3655,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,it does not feel great feel a bit flimsy the keyboard itself it feel like if it is gon na break cuz of no support the weight is all in the iphone right so when sliding it out it somehow is difficult to type / text with an ease prone to breaking i got it returned liked the concept need more work on it,61,15
3656,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,bought this for the wife after she switched to the iphone she had a keyboard on her previous phone and just did not like the iphone touch screen this predict was easy to install even for the technically challenged easy to use lighted keyboard and does not require recharging very often great product only negatives i can see is it adds weight and thickness to the phone,66,16
3657,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,first unit was bought new from online retailer unit worked as long as usb charging cable was attached once removed unit shut off battery defective unit replaced and similar problem battery charge only lasted a hour or so thinking the units that retailer had were bad one was ordered directly from boxwave via amazon that unit had intermittent working keys on the keyboard i would not recommend this product as 3 out of 3 were defective,76,17
3658,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,the keyboard would not work properly but that was not my problem with the product it was the actual company i contacted customer service and they did not get back to me till 4 days later they do not have a phone number to contact them they could not even see in their records that i had already sent their product back when they finally contacted me would never never order anything from boxwave ever again,71,18
3659,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,the virtual keyboard keys are a little to small for me and my smart phone makes me feel a little dumb you know always spelling a word before you can finish your sentence spell check is good and sometimes i need it but not with ever word the keyboard buddy allows me to text with ease it makes the phone a little thick i can live with that just what i needed,72,19
3660,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,since getting my iphone last may i have never repeat never been able to text an a without hitting the caps key and never been able to hit an m without deleting the previous letter everyone told me that i would get used to it and adjust so either i was defective or the phones keypad is not made for my size fingers size 8 gloves short nails having me believe that any man with much bigger hands and fingers would not have trouble with the iphone keyboard after searching for many alternatives the boxwave keyboard came into view and offered backlighting a decent sized space bar located in the middle of the keyboard and best of all raised keys so touch really comes back into play with texting the additional bulk has not deterred my from carrying my phone in carpenter jeans nor an already crowded purse and the bluetooth connected is great i recommend this for all iphone owners who look up to see that their text is not what they thought it was and is instead jibbery glibberish,181,20
3661,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,it neat and it works it does not have any awesome features but it is still pretty cool the keys are a bit small but it is what it is,28,21
3662,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i recently purchased this case from seller and it was brand new never been used the box was a little beat up but the case is beautiful and is easy to use i only have two problems with it after a week or so the case faded pretty fast and looks really dirty even after keeping it in a case the whole time the way the material is makes it hard to keep clean and now i do not even like to take it out of my pocket second thing i found is the p key does not work all that well after a week you have to press extra hard on it to get it to work if someone could tell me how to restore the material on the case i could live with the one defect of the keyboard,139,22
3663,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,it is supposed to be a keyboard but does not have a question mark also it is a little clucky than anyone would really like to be honest but it doesnts have a full keyboard,32,23
3664,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,this case / keyboard works just fine everything functions well my only complaint is that it is difficult to hold / balance as the top where the phone is is so much heavier than where the keyboard is makes it uncomfortable to hold while typing functionality is fine i do not know how one would redesign this to fix this i have become accustomed to using siri so i do not have to type at all,71,24
3665,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i purchased the white backlit iphone keyboard case it worked well but was not worth the money it was very bulky and top heavy when i put my phone in my pocket my jeans stained it blue in areas,39,25
3666,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,not worth it wanted my new iphone to work as my old htc evo shift but it did not to bulky and i do not like the full touch screen very much i i phone is not all that bad,38,26
3667,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,i was thrilled with theof a regular keyboard against touch keyboard on my iphone it is a more comfortable way to type for me the addition of the keyboard adds a little bulk to the phone but is very comfortable and lower profile than the one my friend has from a year ago the problem i have with this product is that i have only been using it for 6 weeks and already the markings on the keyboard have rubbed off so now i can not see the functions of many of the keys it does not matter much on the letters but the symbols are gone and i have to guess and hunt for the right ones now not acceptable wear,122,27
3668,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,I have had this for about 5 months and i got to say it attracts a lot of attention from co-workers to complete stranger works great but can be a bit annoying from time to time it takes a while to get used to but once you do it all good i find it hard to get the phone out of the case although and the battery dies to quickly for my liking but overall a great product and highly recommended,79,28
3669,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,the keyboard setup was the only positive about thisotherwise it was to heavy and it would take forever to connect my phone was so heavy it was very odd to old and to put in my pocket,39,29
3670,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,i love having a full keyboard for my iphone 4s but there are a few changes i would like to see numbers / and sign you have to use fn button before and after numbers or and sign so it is no longer a shortcut to text b4 2morrow and more i would like to see a microphone key so siri could be accessed backlighting i do not think it is worth the extra money to buy backlit case it does not light up the keys so you can not type in the dark anyway camera flash i have used the flash with the keyboard closed and open and it works just fine for the 4s,109,30
3671,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,this is keyboard is the best thing since slice bread i know u guys know what i mean the backlight if the keys are perfect for being in the dark not like others the lovely keyboard is in the right place it is worth the money to me,47,31
3672,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,it was a cool case and made good conversation the white got dirty after 2 days and the usb charger port broke after a week because i barely hit it at the wrong angle on my desk I am returning it and getting my money back it was fun while it lasted,51,32
3673,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,5.0,positive,i saw thison youtube and decided to buy it it is 60 bucks and for a otter box i pay around the same price so it was not a big deal i bought it without reading review and after i purchased it i started to read the reviews and the comments on it were not how do you say likable so my thoughts on it were a little shaky waiting on it it took 3 business days to arrive when it did i hooked it up it looks amazing it is really easy to use it took a while getting used to it but by the end of the night i had it down con about it really the only thing i noticed it is a little slippery the matte white is a tad bit slippery but other than that box wave did a good job if you like to be original and you like to have things that no one really has this is a way to stand out i love it,173,33
3674,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,thisis fine but the kyboard does not have a comfortable feel to it and it is hard to get to the top and side buttons on top of that the slide got loose within a week of having it now there is a smallbetween the case and keyboard and a slight wiggle if u do not hold the keyboard and phone at the same time i have the white one terribleliterally on the first day of puttin it in my holster it got thestuck on it and it will not come out for nothing I have tried everything not being able to clean it is the biggest issue for me I am almost fine with it feeling crappy but looking crappy just ruins the whole thing for me i would not recommend you not to buy it but i will say i could have saved the money or bought something else it is cool the first week of having it but after that it gets old dirty and old,172,34
3675,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,did anybody else have trouble with buttons not working my r t o p and k do not work this makes it very hard to type on,27,35
3676,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,i bought it about 4 months ago and I have only used it like 2 times it feels funny in your hand and the keys felt stuck it would turn off and on by itself and was just a waste of money,41,36
3677,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i love the case i got it yesterday and i there is nothing really about it that i do not like i just got to get used to where the keys are but the only flaw about it is my keyboard seems a little loose but besides that it is a great case and i would recomend it to everyone who wants a physical keyboard to use plus the backlite is very usefull in dark areas,73,37
3678,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,i tried using this keyboard for a good week before deeming that it was just too bulky and hard to get used to this case almost doubles the size of the iphone and the keys are not placed in the greatest positions also it tends to be glitchy when it comes to capitalizing letters i would try to capitalize letters with the keyboard buddy and it would turn off the capitalization on the iphone i would highly recommend against buying this product,83,38
3679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,i do not usually write bad reviews but if i can dissuade at least 1 person from buying this product then i will consider that a success heres why i used this product for 3 minutes and decided to return it immediately white finish is extremely prone to marks or stains got it is first stain within the first 3 minutes of having it no thank you not enough room for your thumb to easily access the top row of keys keys do not provide much tactile feedback have to press kind of hard to get the letters to register angle at which it holds the phone in relation to the keyboard is awkward almost like the phone is tilted back a little bit too much overall as some other reviewers have stated this keyboard does add some bulk to the phone i think this should be expected from an add-on keyboard such as this i would say that the added bulk was not an issue for me and if you are hesitant about buying this keyboard for that reason you should not let that consideration affect your purchase decision for the usability issues bulleted above i would rate thisas a do not buy unless there is some reason that you absolutely can not live without the physical keyboard other than that the iphones mediocre and free on-screen keyboard provides a much more friendly experience,238,39
3680,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,1.0,negative,thisis not worth the 60 dollars it costs i was hoping to have an easier time typing however with most of the applications it does not turn it also drains you battery i had to charge my phone 5 to 6 times a day very unhappy sending theback,52,40
3681,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,after receiving this in the mail i must say it is not what i thought it was going to be you are basically paying 63 for a plastic case that prevents you from using your flash and has poor key quality the keyboard works fine but the backlight is constantly going away and the keys themselves are very tiny,56,41
3682,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,i do love this keyboard a lot and i was so excited i got one-day shipping and it came on time the only bad thing about it is it adds a little bulk to your iphone connecting the bluetooth is very easy and quick i just do not like the thickness it adds to my phone I had recommend this to anyone who does not mind a little bulk,67,42
3683,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for a case with the slide out keyboard this is as good as it gets for now the case and keyboard are a bit bulky but they get the job done i find myself taking the case off when I am at work and only using it when at home,53,43
3684,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,the first impression i got from people was this is so cool however after carrying it for a few weeks it does not look white anymore white is very delicate then after a month i started having connectivity issues something the nuu minikey never had i had to keep resetting it with a pencil therefore overall it does the job but has a couple of ticks that might annoy you,69,44
3685,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,this is like the worst design ever it will make your phone super thick and look stupid the keys do not work well either it will sometimes type two letters in one press on the keys and the keys were not placed like a regular keybord instead all the keys were placed in stright lines this make the typing harder because you will always type at the wrong position the phone is really heavy and it is really hard to hold it and type when this thing is on it it just not look good at all do not waste your money,99,45
3686,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,4.0,positive,wonderful keyboard overall but with minor issues using it to type this review and since I have owned a boxwave keyboard prior to using this one I am used to the keyboard layout added features lock button nothing too special about this for me since I am used too locking my phone after closing the keyboard one press function lock takes some time getting used to but better for typing number strings grips on f and j keys for more accurate typing pros finally backlit also has a button to turn of backlight for when you do not need it overall same keyboard layout some keys have moved but better overall for typing cons white model has issues with photography and flash considering painting the inside cutout black could have been tested for this issue white model can also get very dirty and cleaning can be an issue after two weeks the edges are browning due to the soft plastic material removed keyboard music controls one of my favorite features of the original has dissapeared overall great product i get comments about it all the time i love using it over apples touch keypad would have gone with black but my iphones white and they match quite nicely,210,46
3687,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,so i was really excited to get this keyboard for my iphone when i got it i put it on my phone and automatically noticed how hard it is to type it also gets dirty really easy too hard to type definetly not worth the price it is bein sold at,50,47
3688,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,great phone which has the comfort of a larger phone mixed with a very easy to use qwerty keyboard the keyboard has nice space and a texture that feels like the kindle with the touch of a button the qwerty turns into 1234 or ect just a need phone highly recommended,52,0
3689,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,the messaging features are nice typing text messages is not so much of a hassle with the keyboard also the screen is quite pretty i have found the morphing keyboard to be a great feature when receiving calls the phone works over half the time but it sometimes resets when i attempt to answer calls also at other times it lights up when a call is coming in but will not actually finish the process and start ringing so i do not know who actually called until they tell me later I am beginning to kick myself for signing a contract for service with this phone and i suspect that it is going to be a pain in the butt until the contract is up,122,1
3690,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,I have had this phone for a couple of months it is pretty cool in the way the screen and keypad can be used in either portrait or landscape however the keys do not have good tactile feedback i have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately it is voice recognition software is worthless so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial such as in the car using an earpiece do not bother the camera and camcorder work very well and the quality of the pictures and display are really good the battery in this phone does not last near as long as my old lg however this phone has many more features so i think the battery life is acceptable it is got a sleek design and it is fun to use however i do not think I had buy another one because of the usability issues,149,2
3691,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,the real standout feature on this phone is keyboard i made the mistake of assuming that the mp3 bluetooth audio would be at least as good as my original lg chocolate from 3 years ago especially since verizon just copies it is old os onto everything the bluetooth stereo is almost unusable very tinny no way to adjust the sound profile if you plug a wire in it sounds great but not very useful phone call quality is ok it has a spot for upto 16 gb card which would be perfect if it was useful as an mp3 player if it was not too late to return it i would also the voice recognition is not accurate or useful something else that used to work flawlessly with my 3yr old chocolate,130,3
3692,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,calls are fine battery life is terrific compared to the lg phone i just discarded nearly identical software found on every other verizon phone I have had yet the standard issue ring tones on this one are pretty bad great camera however no support bluetooth file system profile nor support for marking multiple photos for push meaning that i have to push each picture painfully and slowly one by one to my pc via bluetooth so i should be done pushing the 100 or so pics i took today in about 28 days lovely also end key is right next to the space key if you inadvertently tap end while using the mobile web it exits no matter what / where you are and it is absolutely maddening while you are trying to learn the keypad layout time on the front display is permanently set to 12mode i do not think I am going to keep this one for long,156,4
3693,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,this is a excellent phone great talk time excellent standby very user friendly i may state it takes a little time to get use to but so does it when you change to new anything the only down fall is the top 3 keys when your texting when you have large fingers besides that i would recommend this phone to anybody my wife and kids go through phones like water so had many phones but this one is very unique exspecially with the flip screen the pictures are excellent minus not having a flash i can live with that because in low light still takes excellent pics the flashes on all other phones are a joke those are only good for a couple of foot so take how you want but i recommend this phone for anybody men or women is is very unique only gripe is for my wife could be in different colors but my gripe is 3 top buttons could be different thanks for reading jeff,169,5
3694,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,pros creative use of buttons big screen qwerty keyboard cons does not sync with outlook clunky user interface muddled audio in ear piece / speakerphone i really have to give credit to samsung because of the creatively designed keypad but i do not recommend this phone overall the phone user interface is not simple and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you are on for example there has an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm i guess I have been spoiled by almost always owning nokias as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces aside from the clumsy ui the biggest thing that killed this for our family was it is inability to sync contacts and calendar events with outlook maybe there has a way to do it with a combination of myverizon and usb cables but it is not worth the effort especially when i can switch to a nokia that takes care of it as an aside i switched to at t a week later because of the poor phone selection at verizon also verizon disables any bluetooth syncing capabilities with outlook even for the few nokias they offer overall the phone is designed creatively but it is hip design does not make up for it is poor ui and lack of features that were essential to me,231,6
3695,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,i got mine for free with the purchase of my wifes blackberry with the understanding that this is not a full computer it is a great tool tpo give you quick access to the internet i really do not like working on lap tops so only own a desktop this leaves me limited in where i can have access to the internet this thing gives me access everywhere i have wireless in the house and i use the broadband everywhere else because it is only a netbook it does have it is limitations if you are looking for a full featured machine this is not for you but for quick access to the internet and most files it is great,116,7
3696,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,overall i like the phone for it is call quality i love the keyboard and find it very easy to type text messages i have not used the camera or the bluetooth features i can access my email accounts easily the main problem with the phone is that locks up when i attempt to use the mp3 player i have an 8 gb microsd card with all of my music on it i hook the phone up to my car radio to play it everything was fine for the first month but now the phone locks up or freezes when it is in media mode and the only way to unlock it is to remove and then replace the battery very annoying the phone has also turned off several times when i was attempting to answer a call,134,8
3697,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,has some real ram issues it is really unusable it takes a good 3 minutes just to run a program i got mine for free for signing up for fios and i feel like i got ripped off i thought it would be a nice little thing because we only have 1 computer in my house but really this can be used for nothing more than a paper weight do not buy i had to give 1 star because 0 stars was not an option,84,9
3698,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,let me preface this review with a disclaimer i am not a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash i need a basic phone and want a few bells and whistles i replaced a basic lg cell phone with the alias2 on the recommendation of a friend i immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays although i swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page pros i love having dedicated keys for voicemail bluetooth and voice menus the rotating keypad is just too cool for words and although i do not send many texts i use the notepad all the time the qwerty keyboard is very easy to use even with fingernails it is nice to know i can check email and have internet access if necessary although i probably never will the camera is great and i like the editing options for pictures the screen size is generous and easy to see especially in landscape mode it is easy to use sound quality is good nice long life of battery charge cons the default backgrounds although those are easy enough to change some functions are difficult to find on the menus that is how i found the voicemail key could not find vm on a menu the ring is not loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket but I have never found a phone with a loud enough ring there has not a button on the outside that will light up the display to check the time you have to open the phoneyes there is it just takes a few seconds for the display to light duh this phone was a good choice for me and I am very happy with it,293,10
3699,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,4.0,positive,i have been using this phone for a few days now and i like it i am not a big gadget phone fan preferring a simpler device that does just what i want the voice quality is acceptable and after a short learning cycle is easy to use the alias 2 allows me a novice texter to send and receive text messages with no real hassles the keypad is a great size even for my larger fingers i would have given 5 stars except for the learning curve required to figure the phone out not that this is bad but it is definitely different than the older phones i was used to,112,11
3700,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,my daughter and i both got the lg env2 about 8 months ago we are currently waiting for our third version of this both phones of our first phones failed within 5 months keys stopped working on outside dropped calls goes back to menu in middle of texting calls contacts at random times and much more we got new ones which were refurbished phones from verizon they lasted a few months before failing with similar problems plus now i have almost no volume even although it is maxed on the setting we are waiting for our next set of new phones to arrive later this week can not wait to see how long these last the upgrade to a different phone is not an option until you have been in the contract one year and can only upgrade one phone then,135,12
3701,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,i loved my samsung alias as most alias owners do i decided to purchase the alias 2 on faith assuming that samsung had simply updated certain features of the original i was mistaken the first thing you will notice is the size the alias 2 is taller thicker and wider than the original if you are like me one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it is super-slim design i would say it is about 50 bulkier than the original while the original slid into your jeans and disappeared the new one will stick out like a sore thumb i suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera / camcorder but i never used that feature too much in the first place ultimately i would say this is the reason i returned the alias 2 but i also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen when texting you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers / symbols / punctuation marks that you need in fact the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters the empty space is a theme on all screens in fact in either orientation as i said i found this annoying maybe only because i became so used to the 1000 figures / symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad i ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original i will keep my new every 2 discount until verizon comes out with a very good android or apple finally relents with the iphone / at t exclusivity,273,13
3702,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,this is probably the wrost experience i had with amazon and it costed me 7200 both my phones from amazon arrived inright time but without activation i called at t and they could not locate our phone numbers so had to call back amazon and learned that they have not activated our phones amazon customer service took good amount of time to do this meanwhile i missed by billing cycle with old cell phone company this process took about a week and not to mention the sim card delivered was not working and amazon had to ship again,97,14
3703,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,5.0,positive,i just got this phone a couple days ago and i am in love it works great texting is a breeze great size,23,15
3704,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,1.0,negative,i love the e-ink technology the qwerty keyboard is great for texting but that is the highlight the huge drawback if you need to make calls with the bluetooth is that the voice activation system is useless my old phone worked flawelessly in this area but with the alias 2 if i say call john smith if it responds and many times it does not it will say did you say dial 123 or some other number or name that is nothing like the one I have said it is incredibly frustrating i do not want to look at my phone as i am driving that is why i rely on the voice activation / bluetooth to make my calls without voice activation working properly i am looking at my phone scrolling through my address book and just generally distracted instead of focusing on the road so disappointing,142,16
4585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,bought this for my i pod 5th generation since the audio jack was broken works great sound quality is also great downside needed volume control headphones on the bright side my phone charger works with this device d,38,0
4586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i got a used ipod touch 2 g only to find that the headphone jack is on the fritz figuring this to be a common problem i opted to keep the ipod instead of return it there are a number of solutions for the problem which include replacing the headphone jack self repair or shop repair or get an audio solution that utilizes one of the ipods features bluetooth wireless headphones or speakers which can be expensive but nice or find an audio line-out that plugs into the connection pins at the bottom of the device i have a sonoma audio device that works just fine for this purpose it seems a little bulky sometimes the adapter i am reviewing here is much smaller and less obtrusive but it has a couple of caveats first when plugged into the ipod the volume can not be adjusted with the ipods volume controls you need to have a volume control on your headphones or on the device you are connecting to or use an app that features volume control also it appears that it does not function as a mic-in at least not with the mini-mic i tried on the whole i think it is worth the price easily you just need to know that you will need to have a way to control the volume since the ipod volume control will not function,229,1
4587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this product works very well however you must handle it with care mine cracked open after handling it a little roughly,21,2
4588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,seeing how few reviews there are for this great product i felt compelled to write a fair and honest review this little adapter is so worth the money i never realized the headphone jack on my ipod touch audio was not optimal i previously had purchased the monster thximini8 1/8 stereo to rca stereo adapter and thought the sound was clear but low volume i hate having to monkey with the volume on the ipod and the receiver i read online about using theconnector for audio but did not realize this micro usb adapter even existed let me tell you the sound is so much an upgrade and it is really easy to use just plug the micro usb adapter into your ipod plug in the headphone jack into the adapter and it even includes a usb input slot to keep your ipod charged while hooked up to your receiver how cool is that the adapter itself is shiny black maybe about half inch long and wide and simply works i originally was skeptical because of the low price and there is another one here that is priced much more and basically the same thing now the volume is controlled strictly by my receiver and has nothing to do with the ipod i do not know how durable it is but i do not plan to plug and unplug the adapter I am leaving it attached to my 1/8 35 mm adapter at all times and only plugging the combined micro usb line out and monster 1/8 to rca into my ipod whenever needed,260,3
4589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i bought this to enable charging an ipod touch in my car with a micro usb adapter and to improve the signal from the ipod to my tape adapter in my car stereo is device handles both of those tasks like a champ and for a great process making it a terrific value update it was too good to be true and broke not too much after i wrote the above even although i was very gentle with it sigh,80,4
4590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,I am a sound tech and a dj and my goal is to get everything down to mix / line level i do not have to worry about what the volume is set at i just hit play and that is it it is nice in an environment where people bring their ipods and people request for you to play a song i thought it was a little pricey for this adapter but it does exactly what i need,73,5
4591,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,usb did not work for power or transfer,8,6
4592,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,does not fit snuggly have trouble with it falling out unable to purchase anything similar to this in the store although thankful that it is available from amazon as my ipod would be worthless without it,36,7
4593,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,did not work as described at all money down the toilet another amazon scam,14,8
4594,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,technically it works but in practice it does not latch into the ipod connector and so is useless in a car,20,9
4595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,it has no latch so it is constantly getting pulled out of the idevice by the attached cables making it unusable in a car buy this only if the idevice you intend to plug it into and the cables plugged into it will not be moved while it is in use,51,10
4596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,falls out all if i move my ipodfound one made by fiio a couple months later from china real cheap that does not fall out all the time,28,11
4597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,i have two of these and love how they can be used with a bluetooth adapter to connect to my car stereo i now have bluetooth in my 1951 chevy pickup,31,12
4598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,it works great the only thing and i did not know this is that it overwrites the volume control in my ipad 2 so there is no way to adjust it it is one volume level for everything but i can live with that,40,13
4599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,easily is detached from ipod could have fixed with a simple clamp on the side also no volume control is available so it blares constantly on some songs and others not loud enough but it serves it is purpose,37,14
4600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,the only real problem i have with this device is that when you insert it into the pin connectors it seems to slip out of it rather easily and there is not anything to keep it locked on place which is not a problem if you are using light earbuds but i like to use big diaphram headphones and it tends to slip out other than that the quality is great and i am glad i made this purchase instead of spending more money on a new generation ipod,87,15
4601,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i was annoyed that the only way to tell which way is up is to try and connect it or to examine the orientation of the prongs once you have connected it once although you can just remember that the micro usb port on the back is oriented upside down from what you would expect it was missing that little symbol that you find on apple connectors that let us you know the upside also it was not as tight fitting as I had like but connectors rarely are i guess it did perform as advertised i was able to use the line out to use my headphones as the audio jack on my ipod is toast for some reason i did not like that i lost all control over the volume but i was expecting that from other reviews so i went with the flow strangely the app i tried to use to boost the volume said there was no volume information I shall try another app only way to fix that permanently is to replace the audio jack which is a pain in the ass due to the way the ipod is put together really retarded to use glue instead of screws to hold the screen on i guess apple does not want you messing with their hardware yourself I am waiting for my battery to completely fail and I shall do just that at the same time I am also able to charge it and plug into my pc so that is mainly what i bought it for i received it in the allotted shipping time frame so i was satisfied with the purchase construction could be a little less cheap but you get what you pay for,279,16
4602,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i used this product to play my old i pod that wouldent work in my car with my aux plug it is a great product but please note that it is not a tight fit for the i pod and you may need to rubberband it to your device to get it to stay on i use this in my car so it does not bother me,66,17
4603,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,as everyone says it falls out but i thought I had keep it in with an attractive rubber band turns out this covers up the ports on it also most importantly the sound through it is terrible tinny no base sounds like it is coming through a can not a good choice if you plan on listening to music through it i ended up getting a kinivo bluetooth receiver for use in my car costs a lot more at 40 but works great give it a look,85,18
4604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i works very well and is a great solution if you ipods audio out port is broken or if you want to charge your ipod with an micro usb cable the only issue is that the connector lacks the side grips that most 30-pin cables have this causes the connecter to disconnect from the ipod if it is not moved carefully the other connections are very sound pun intended and hold up nicely moved other than that this connector was a great purchase and after a few months is still working for me great solution,94,19
4605,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,small and effective best describes this product better sound is achieved through this product with minimal distortion from the device,21,20
4606,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,it works well but this model pops out very easily look for one that stays in the port more securely,20,21
4607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this device is just what you would expect it sits very loosely in the port but it gets the job done i was hoping to be able to use it with my lifeproof iphone 4 case but it does not fit,41,22
4608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,been using this thing in my car for like ever works great especially if your headphone jack does not work anymore,20,23
4609,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,i got this because the earbud jack on my ipod broke if you are in the same boat do not get this you can not control the volume it is way too loud,30,24
4610,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,well since my regular headphones jack broke in my ipod video and repairing is not worth it i bought this little accessory to buy my ipod video some extra time before ending in the ipod cemetery-museum although the product works and theis very good these are the problems i have found the volume of the ipod does not control the headphone volume at all if you use this connection so there has only one setting of maximum volume by default that you can not change the connector itself is all the time coming out the ipod so the music stops suddenly this is specially annoying when you connect the ipod to the aux in the car or to run with the ipod in your pocket since every bump or minimum move makes the connector lose it is sound from the ipod something as simple as two little buttons on the sides to release the connector like some apple chargers have would have fix this looks like there has nobody working for the qa dept of this company the piece came out chipped on the side so not very happy with that either i have heard there are similar products that are better for a couple of bucks extra and comes with the side solution for the connection so do not buy this unless you want to find yourself annoyed by these issues every 5 minutes,234,25
4611,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,as others have mentioned 30pin side is a somewhat loose fit into my iphone 4 but it works just have to be careful not to have any pulling motion on the cable when in use product did do what i was looking for charge my iphone through a usb cigarette lighter adapter and provide output to my car aux input jack,60,26
4612,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,i bought two different ones since these were so cheap the other one i bought had a locking mechanism which keeps it from falling off when the wire is slightly pulled well i got what i paid for,38,27
4613,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,i wanted to use to replace my headphones jack of my ipod but turns out you can not control the volume with this [ however it was cheap soooooo eh,29,28
4614,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,it was ok i can listen to my music the only down fall is it dose not clip in so i have to watch what I am doing while listening to it but other then that great plus i can charge it at the same time if need be with a cell phone charger which make it osm because i alwayz have the wire due to charging my cell,68,29
4615,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,pro lineout works and the device charges microusb attaches securely uses microusb con lacks latching tabs so this thing falls out easily like at the slightest provocation a little too big to use with most cases really needs the spring loaded tabs found on most charging cables in practice this is quite annoying to use,56,30
4616,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,my audio output is messed up bad thought of something like this amazon gave me this works great charger and all there was just one thing about it that is a little bit irritating you can not change the volume of your ipod or iphone when it is plugged in,48,31
4617,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,if you have an iphone or touch with a busted earphone socket and you are not into microsoldering this is the rig for you you may need an external volume control if you are feeding into an earphone and you will need a microusb charger it does not have the hooks to lock it into the 30 pin port i use scotch tape,62,32
4618,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,i mostly bought this because i only wanted to keep my microusb charging cable in my car i figured that with this plugged into my ipod i could just charge either it or my phone from the same cable sadly for whatever reason it caused my music to stop whenever i plugged or unplugged my ipod and the audio jack which i did not technically need did not have a nice tight fit so i took it out of my car and use the adaptor to charge my ipod in my living room it still gets two stars because i am still using it for something but i would not buy one again,110,33
4619,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,this adapter is exactly what it looks like it functions well is very durable and works with every idevice i own it is also a very quick fix for those pesky ipod headphone jack failures it seamlessly kept my ipod working in the car until i had time to fix the headphone jack,53,34
4620,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,accidental sent to my old address and they fixed it and it got to me super fast thank you so much my i pods head phone jack quit working instead of sending back to apple to fix it which could take forever and cost a ton i bought this and now my i pod is working great again thank you so much,61,35
4621,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,nice output good for use on home sustems without a dedicated ipod connection and with th enew generation mac products having a new connection it is well worth skipping the dedicated connection,32,36
4622,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,good option if your headphone jack stops working like mine did kinda dulls the sound a little but if you can not afford to go buy a new ipod this helps fix a broken port problem,35,37
4623,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,my daughter broke her headphone piece off in her ipod the piece was removed but you still could not use headphones we saw this and thought this was a cheaper solution than buying a new ipod she loves it she can hear her music again laughing out loud,45,38
4624,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this product is just alright it does a job but not very well this product comes out of my ipod / iphone a lot and the whole reason why i got this was because my 250 ipod classic was broke because the headphone jack was broken so i could not hear anything out of my headphones so i bought this and it works but not only does it come out of my ipod easily there is also no volume control so the music blasts through my headphones at 100 even when you turn the volume down or set a volume limit on the ipod so basically i am back to square one i would not reccomend this if you are looking for the same solution that i was but if you are looking for something to use through the car stereo then go for it,143,39
4625,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,thisworks as described i used this adapter on an ipad2 ipod touch 2 and 3 and an iphone 4s it worked on all devices there have been no problems wi the charging function depending on the type of device case there could be some interference i use a speck candycase for the phone and there was only slight interference the ipod touch 3 has an earlier version of a speck case and the thin plastic around the 30 pin connector broke the biggest complaint is that the adapter does not have the latches to secure it to the device and it can pop out if the device is moved while the adapter is in place,117,40
4626,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this works well if you are sitting still but if u are active this is a pain the device does not lock onto your apple product i manage using a little scotch tape to keep it on but beside physical problems ipod output jacks do not support it is main volume it is just plan loud i would recommend getting a volume control if you are going to use the head phone jack but i also recommending getting a adapter that can latches itself to the ipod even if cost just a little more,93,41
4627,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,i received this product 2 days before expected it works great i bought this as my ipods audio auxillary does not work on the left speaker unless i hold it in place this was a fabulous substitute also i realized that my phone charger fits the mini usb and charges the ipod also no need for the additional charger i love it i took it on a hike with my dogs as soon as i got it according to some previous reviews it comes out easily i was a little worried that it would come loose and I had lose it but it stayed put for the entire 1 hour walk up the hills and through the woods it was great i really do not think that it is loose at all i love it,132,42
4628,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this is what i wanted and does the job reasonably well the only trouble is that unlike the apples adapter it does not has the catches on the plug and easily slip out,32,43
4629,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,this product does exactly what it is supposed to but it will not stay connected to my iphone there are no connecting tabs like with iphone chargers,27,44
4630,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this is an ok product it works fine but it does not allow for volume control i also wish it had the little locking tabs on the connector to hold it into the ipod would be a good buy if your headphones or listening device has it is own volume control,50,45
4631,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this product technically works for what i needed it to do which was to bypass my broken headphone jack however the volume is very low when i use this thing and it falls out really easily,36,46
4632,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,my xbs port for my headphones stopped working on one side it worked as a new port for them now i do not have volume controlsomething in the adapter is making my i pod nano do this i know this is true because the other port has volume controlbut i did have to pay a costly repair bill or replace it,60,47
4633,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,this is a good product but it does not allow you to control volume this sets it at full volume so the music gets really loud not the best solution for a broken headphone jack,35,48
4634,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,generally will not write reviews but was compelled to write reviews it would have been a great product if it would have stayed inside the connector it just comes out too often too easilty,33,49
4635,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,it may not be anything special it does the job obviously you can not control the volume out on the ipod adapters like this so if you are using headphones expect volume at full do not ever hit the adapter when plugged into the ipod mine bent and the prongs bent also nothing some tape will not fix,55,50
4636,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this connector does exactly what i hoped except for one annoying thing since it has the line out built-in it does not allow the headphone port to be used i bought this to reuse my micro usb connector for my old palm pre it does that just fine but i also use a wired headset when talking in the car i hate bluetooth headsets do not like having another thing to charge so this adapter messes with my setup otherwise the power adapter portion works great,84,51
4637,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this product is complete rubbish after 3 days of having it the thing stopped working no matter what iphone / ipod put it in the device would not register it being plugged in also there is no volume control it sticks out miles from the ipod and looks really cheep,47,52
4638,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,i purchased mine at amazon for 799 excellent product for that price it gives the user line out audio quality plus the ability to charge and sync the iphone / ipod device,30,53
4639,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this adaptor does not have the 2 pins on the sides that hold a typical cable into theconnector as a result the adpator is constantly falling out or the right audio channel stops or the left or no audio and the iphone speaker is activated you can not pick up the iphone or the adaptor will start slipping remember that the cables on the end weigh quite a bit this is worse than useless might even short out theoutput,82,54
4640,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,good for the money does the job got confused with micro usb connection i was expecting mini usb all good so far,22,55
4641,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,the headphone jack on my ipod touch quit working so i purchased this product to see if i would be able to use headphones again on my ipod and it worked,31,56
4642,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,i bought thisbecause my ipod headphone jack was broken beyond repair in fact i repaired it on multiple occasions only to have it break again thiswas appealing because it allowed headphones to be connected through the usb port this product is good if you want to connect your ipod to a stereo with it is own volume control with optimal sound in the case of headphones using thisdefeated the purpose because now my ipod is stuck on the highest volume setting possible with no way to adjust it so this is a good product for stereos but not for regular headphones now i am on the hunt for headphones with their own personal volume control unrelated to the ipod itself i doubt i will be able to do this so a new ipod is now on my wishlist,143,57
4643,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,this did not work with my daughters itouch we plugged in a pair of headhphones into the new adapter and it worked but there has no way to control the volume going into the headphones the volume was full blast and there was no way to lower it the adapter disables the itouch volume controls the volume was on high and she could not even wear headphones because it was too loud it would have been nice if the product description stated this fact very disappointed,84,58
4644,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,this was just what i was looking for and more all i wanted was something tiny that would allow me to only carry one charging cable with me i use an android phone that takes a micro usb charger and i wanted to be able to charge my ipod on the go too this does the job perfectly it also allows me to play music in a much better quality then the standard headphone jack for plugging my ipod into a stereo if you need either a charging adapter or a eq free audio jack then buy this adapter the only down side at all is there is no latch to hold the adapter into the ipod this is not a big deal for in your car or on a desk but in your pocket it can because this adapter to come loose i rate this a 9/10,148,59
4645,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,thisis great from a standpoint of never needing to pack an extra cable however fails in that it lacks any form of locking mechanism unlike the actual ipod / iphone cable this means that if the slightest tension pulls on your cable the connector will come loose and lose connection making it almost unusable as a carconnector,59,60
4646,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,my ipod aux port only plays 1 channel after so much use so i got this so that i can get both channels left right speakers to play in my car and charge my ipod with a micro usb port the same as my phone while i use a cassette adapter but i do not like this product much because you can not adjust the volume and because the connection to my ipod is flimsy not my ipods fault the products fault and it falls out easily update the unchangeable volume that it plays at I am going to is around 80 maximum volume in my cars both 2003 lexus es300 and 2001 is300 and probably most toyotas because toyotas make lexus this volume was too loud and distorted sound quality i was afraid this would damage my speakers in the long run and so i have stopped taking this thing around me and so this purchase was a waste of money for me the result of this product may not be the same for everyone who purchases it but i provide you with my case to help anyone out,186,61
4647,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,1.0,negative,take the 799 you would spend on this and put it toward the sendstation pocketdock if you look at this thing the wrong way it will fall out of the iphonesit is totally unsecure a waste of money,40,62
4648,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i was looking for something like this convert my old palm pre micro usb data cable into a workable iphone 4 data cable this adapter does the job just fine it is not fancy nor does it lock in place like original iphone data cables but for the money and the ability so reuse an old cable from another phone is priceless now i can keep a data cable at work and one at home i have not tried the line out port and honestly I am not too sure what it is for i really do not have any use for it so i can not give any review on it hope this helps,111,63
4649,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,before getting thisi had been plugging a couple different stereos into the headphone jack of my ipad and ipod touch that worked ok but finding the right volume setting for the line-in connection could be a bit tricky now with this i do not worry about the volume of the ipad just the stereo it is easier and i think the sound quality is better,65,64
4650,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,moved to iphones from palm and bought two of thesemicro usb line out adapter connector for apple iphone 3 g 3gs iphone 4 ipad 2 ipod allows me to use my old car chargers and has the bonus of better audio out as well,46,65
4651,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i have purchased this adaptor to save the 35 mm jack in my iphone as i use it to connect to my old company car stereo that has no bluetooth support so by only plugging the charger connector i would be able to do both things charge iphone and listen to music with only one connection at first i thought that the sound quality would not change from one to other type of connection but the sound quality of the signal generated through the lower connector was awful distorted and the use of this connector disables iphone volume control as i have also carried out a test with a docking cradle that i could purchase locally with pretty much the same function with the same results i can not affirm that this is an issue of this product in particular but as far as i am convinced this kind of connection will not work properly for this type of use maybe there is some kind of configuration that should be carried out although my last shot will be a bluetooth adaptor i hope it works now as far as the product finishing and other quality aspects i have no concerns about it it looks good fits correctly and i have got none of those messages about the product being incompatible with iphone 4,222,66
4652,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,the adapter is well built and the micro-usb and phono jack ports work well but the appleconnector is built without the clips necessary to hold it into a device iphone 3gs for me this causes the adapter to pull out from the device with the slightest touch interrupting charging and music playback if you use this in the car like i did a sharp turn can even make it disconnect i would not use this adapter for any use where you need to hold your phone or pick it up it is only good for stationary settings like outputting to a stereo even then picking it up to pick a song will because it to disconnect,117,67
4653,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,3.0,neutral,this is a realitively cheap solution when compaired to genuine apple brand accessories for a person wanting to add a line out jack on their ipod iphone as other posters have stated the 30-pin apple connector on this does not lock in place and easily falls out when being handled forget about mounting this thing anywhere it makes it dangerous in a vehicle due to the tempation to try and fix this while driving use some sense and wait until you stop to fix the plug or browse for a new song for that matter in any case you must provide you are own 1/8 stereo cable to connect to you are vehicles aux port on the stereo also you will need a 12v dc to usb micro charger if you intend to charge you are device asside from the very big problem of the adaptor falling out it works sounds pretty good and does charge just fine,156,68
4654,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,5.0,positive,bought this adapter on a whim and it has not disappointed me it charges syncs and does audio as well it does not hurt that it is priced well and eliminates the need to have the iphone cable with me at all times great buy,42,69
4655,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,2.0,negative,when i read the reviews of this adapter i have to say that it looked good so i decided to try it first looks were good the product was in good condition when i plugged it in to my ipod it worked fine problems i had you could not plug your headphones all the way in you had to put them about 3/4 of the way in also the connector does not lock in place this means that if it moves a little bit it will fall out of the ipod i would have been fine with it if it had the locking prongs and if it did not break within 10 minutes of listening to music I had have to say those were some of the worst 8 I have ever spent,129,70
4656,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,took a dremel to this unit since it would not fit into the apple iphone4 bumper but after that it works like a charm and for very little relative to other products,32,71
4657,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,i bought thisto access the line out from my iphone you get better sound quaility from the line out than you do from the head phone jack when you use the headphone jack you are sending a signal that is meant for headphones and is variable so that you may increese or decrese the volume for the headphones when you plug something into your aux in on your stereo your stereo is set up to receive a line level input when you use thison your apple product iphone 4 in my case you will get a warning diolog box telling you that this is not normal you can dismiss this and listen to your music with better clarity the only difference is you can only control your volume from the stereo or amplifier itself the micro usb allows you to charge your phone with any standard usb to micro usb cable i would give it 5 stars if it had a solid wire coming out instead of having to deal with the micro usb connector the price is fair would be better if it was amazon prime no extra shipping costs,198,72
4658,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041F3A02,4.0,positive,my ipod took a spill down some stairs and the headphones bent the audio jack in such a way the connection was never complete causing some sounds to come through but not others i did some research and bought one of these guys to see if it would solve the problem since i can not really afford to have the ipod repaired it works great I had say the sound quality is actually better than before i would not hesitate to give this product a five star rating except for two things the product falls out a lot and wiggles in the slot and the lack of volume control required me to buy another cable i justtaped it in place and it works great,123,73
6114,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,all of the reviews saying this is cute and fits well are true upon arrival i was perfectly happy with this case but within two days the edges started peeling where the image is sort of laminated on it now looks like a mess oh well at least it was not pricey,51,0
6115,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,does not offer much in the way of protection i thought it was going to be textured but it is just flat all around a big old meh i like the 99 cent silicon cassette tape cover better,36,1
6116,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,the design is printed into the plastic so there has nothing that should wear or peel off over time i do not particularly like this style of case it barely covers the phone has no lip that comes around the front of the screen to protect the phone when setting it face-down on surfaces it is made of that plastic that has a slightly soft or velvet feel to it even although it is not coated with anything it is nice just a little more grippy the design is really adorable i love that it says 01134 so cute if you are looking for a really minimal hard snap-on case and you like the design you would like this case it is just not what i was looking for i thought maybe the buttons would be shaped in the plastic more or maybe feel like rubbery calculator buttons but the design is simply in the flat plastic it is still high-quality and very cute although,158,2
6117,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,this case looked great for about a week but the camera image completely wore off it is now just an ugly black case this is a horrible product,27,3
6118,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i love this case it is so cute and fits really well on my phone it is actually kind of hard to get off without fear of damaging it just make sure to clean your phone before you put it on and you should be all set i really love the look of it and actually the case is not super smooth plastic like other snap on cases so it has a bit more traction not much although,77,4
6119,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i love this case i think it is fun quirky and everyone compliments it i only give it 4 stars because i wish it covered the screen as well but for the amount you pay it is an awesome cover and great for protecting my phone,43,5
6120,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this case is absolutely wonderful gives your iphone 4 a perfect retro camera look got exactly what i was looking for the case has got a matte finish to it fits perfectly and have no trouble accessing the exterior buttons on the side go for it,46,6
6121,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this was the perfect gift for my husband he is a photographer and his phone now displays his work of art i would recommend this to others,27,7
6122,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,this is a very unique looking case however it does not do much to protect your expensive investment will spark a conversation although,22,8
6123,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,if you are looking for something unique this is it if you are looking for protection for your expensive phone keep looking,22,9
6124,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,hard plastic allows for it to slide in to your pocket easily and it was one of the best cases that got the most recognition it is paint ob held up well and only until the end did it finally start to break up,43,10
6125,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,awesome cover for my iphone 4s i got a lot of comments and people even asked me where i got it from does not protect phone at all,28,11
6126,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i love the image look shape and feel of the case but the image peeled off like a sticker after only about a week total bummer,26,12
6127,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i was highly disappointed with the quality of thisi absolutely did not put it on my phone the picture of the camera is fuzzy and pixelated horrible quality embarrassing,31,13
6128,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,the photos do not match thei received these ones are not original i ordered these products because they were original and they were under the fred and friends and all i got was something that looks printed out and homemade very very low quality i do not recomend this seller,51,14
6129,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,iphone retro camera case does not look like it does in the photo the photo is more realistic and more 3 dimensional the camera case i received was cheap looking and looks like the image was flat and pixelated i think i overpaid for this case,46,15
6130,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i got the radio cover as a christmas gift in less then a month the paint started chipping after leaving a trail of chipped away radio everywhere i go i scratched the rest off I am hoping the case itself will last me until the new iphone is released,49,16
6131,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,definitely not what the pictures shows it looks like someone printed out a picture of a camera with a printer that was running out of ink and glued it to the back of a cheap flimsy iphone case no thank you to cheap to resale so i will be giving this away,52,17
6132,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,the snap cover does not stand proud of the front glass it is fit does not feel secure it is glossy so offers no more grip than the glass the phone can slide up and down about 1 mm which is disconcerting when you go to press the lock button on top the graphic looks cool although but i think i will return to a better snap case that has some texture and covers the front edges it is a shame it was not made better i have a lot of other fred products that i like a lot,95,18
6133,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i think the case looks better thicker and a little bit cooler on line once i received it was thin and some what cheap looking it is a good fix if you break your favorite one i guess so just okay,40,19
6134,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,i personally do not like this one it was good at first then within the first week the paint stared chipping off,22,20
6135,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,the calculator design is great makes your phone seem like a vintage calculator great for tricking your friends or breaking thehowever protection wise not so great the cover is made of really weak plastic and does not offer much protection for your iphone personally i cracked it within a week,51,21
6136,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,for the price you can not really complain as a photographer it is a great signature fo rmyself and people love it the black paint wears easily on the edges and itsnt built for a long life is not really bulit for more then just looks however it was fun to have,50,22
6137,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i purchased this case in the calculator design it is cute and a bit of a conversation starter after a month or so one of the sides broke off i constantly drop my phone and this case provides little protection so I have had to switch if you are looking for something cool get this but if you need to keep your phone safe I had pass,65,23
6138,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,this is a great case works well for work u can set it down and it look like a office calculator this product needs a little help it does not hold up to excessive use with in two days started to rub off,43,24
6139,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this awesome retro case was the exacti was looking for I shall just say that if you are looking for an iphone case that protects the front of the screen then this is not the case for you this is just a backing case but i love it nonetheless and have not had any problems with it but then again I am a nazi about taking care of my things i have made it a point to secure this iphone baby at all times to ensure the glass does not crack,88,25
6140,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i find this to produce a nice retro camera look the graphics are high quality and durable on the phone i get compliments on it i have a 4s and the room for the buttons is fine,37,26
6141,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i saw the other reviews and thought i was being very careful to protect my case but within a couple of weeks it was very scuffed and dirty will probably end up throwing it out if you are buying it for novelty value be aware you will not get much use out of it,53,27
6142,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,love this product it fits perfectly and the graphics are beautiful it is very nostalgic for me but none of my much younger coworkers have anywhat a transistor radio is,32,28
6143,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,all aspects of order handling and delivery good but product has one minor flaw in my opinion it does not quite come all the way to the front of the phone the mark of a good slimline case to me is an almost imperceptible lip over the front so that the phone can be placed face down without the screen coming in to contact with whatever surface it is placed on,70,29
6144,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,i purchased this for my iphone 4s and it fits perfectly no hassles what-so-ever i can access all buttons and use the usb charger with the case on I am not for sure if the case is made well sure it feels strong but is it strong enough i guess I shall find out when i eventually drop my phone anyhow my only real complaint is the camera sticker / cover is not sharp and rich in detail it is not pixelated but simply looks blurred or the cover used came from a scanned image kinda upsetting but i have no intentions on sending the product back or buying an alternative case / cover also my phone did not arrive in the package as pictured above it was opened and bubble wrapped,125,30
6145,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,this is a hard plastic cover that fits snugly but allows room for the function buttons i had a transistor radio when i was a kid so i love the way the case looks very clever product shipped quickly and was reasonably priced,43,31
6146,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,i was under the impression that this was more than just a photo reproduction on a flat glassy surface that aside the design is upside down if you want to use the volume button to take photos holding the phone horizontally the design on the case is upside down from how you are holding the camera iphone it should be right side up in alignment with how you would click a camera button the photo of the man in the picture is a misrepresentation of the product i received,89,32
6147,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,the case is very cute which is why i bought it in the first place the back has a non slip surface which i also liked however it is only been a month and theis starting to peel off totally ruins the effect of the case,47,33
6148,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,i like this cover works perfect for my iphone 4s the only draw back is i thought it was matte but it is actually super shiney and gets finger prints on it very easily I shall probly end up gifting it,39,34
6149,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,the case is good for the price the case does not cover the volume buttons bottom or top of the phone,21,35
6263,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,i did not receive this product when i ordered it for the 1st time when i contacted the seller they sent me the protector again this is a pack of 2 screen protectors the screen protector had scratches when we looked at it carefully on opening and there was a sticker reading peel it here this sticker did not come out easily and gives a sticky appearance at the screen corner not worth buying she shall out some money and buy a good screen protector,84,0
6264,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,5.0,positive,greatjust like they describe fit like you say would recommend to anyone who is looking for a screen protector for their 101 tablet,25,1
6265,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,thiswas shipped in bubble wrap packaging which was great took me a bit to put this thing on instructions were not very clear and i still have bubbles in it but overall this screen protector does it is job,39,2
6266,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,as with many people I have done lots of these screen protectors so I shall cut to the chase here as of the date i bought these these films were just slightly too large none of them could be installed without trimming i did end up trimming about 2 mm off the long bottomand rounding those two corners and getting a reasonable install albeit not perfect moreover the films are high-gloss which look fabulous until you touch them they not only show fingerprints they cling to them which means that after using your tab for five minutes your screen is covered with fingerprints to my estimates about three times as bad as the screen alone with no film and that became too much for me to handle i ended up pulling it off and going with a different product that said bluemall is a fantastic seller and takes good care of their customers so buy from them with confidence I have bought many sold by bluemall items on amazon and their service is fabulous it is just this particular product that i have issue with,185,3
6267,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,is durable and can be cleaned but dust flies to it once dry so you need to apply it right away i had trouble getting all the bubbles out and am usually pretty good at it it looks good when the tablet is on but when off you can see the covering overall it works great for the cheap price upate i cleaned the sheet again after a few days and let it air dry then moved to a room where the air was settled to apply this time it worked great and i got most of the bubbles out,100,4
6268,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,does exactly what they say it will do cover your screen and protect it it is very clear and works great,21,5
6269,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,3.0,neutral,it is bigger than the tablet so i had to cut it quit dificcult to do it nex time i will not buy nothing from them,24,6
6270,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,it worked great the hole for taking pictures was not quite big enough a leather punch took care of that,20,7
6271,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,5.0,positive,great for keeping my screen newwill recommented to my friends and family i may order some more myself got here fast to,22,8

6275,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,3.0,neutral,it was way too big for the tab 2 101 and it was very hard to install i ended up buying another one from else where because this on was not that great great price for a not so great product,40,12
6276,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,i had to cut lt down and i thus ruined the first one i needed seven more words to sub mit review,22,13

6278,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,i would have given 5 stars if there were spots cut out for my tablet s built in speakers thank you,20,15
6279,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,the stickers 2 on the protector could not come off completely rendering the protector to be useless and it also does not stick to the screen surface,27,16
6280,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,4.0,positive,the screen protector works well it had good fit and finish it installed easly with no problems it has really protected the samsung,23,17
6281,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,shipping was desent did not take long at all but when i recieved the product i was not impressed the packaging was bad and the screen protecter it is self was pinched in two places so when i put it on u can see the creases created by the pinch i was not happy with product will not buy again,57,18
6282,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,the screen saver was larger than the screen and covered the speakers we had to modify it to fit also only sent one so if there was an issue you would be paying for nothing,35,19
6283,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,this cover is not the right dimensions covers the speakers on the side and dies not cover top camera properly you get what you pay for and return would cost more than purchase do not recommend,36,20
6284,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,5.0,positive,this was the perfect place to buy great screen protectors and they are very inexpensive and they shipped them earlier then they said,23,21
6285,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,the fit really is not quite right it was a bit too long and covered the speakers a properly fitting protector should leave the speakers exposed we initially installed ours upside down so i can not speak to other issues such as bubbles and more,42,22
6286,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,the first thing i noticed wrong was that the 10 screen protetor did not fit my tablet big size have to cut it little bit no good covered speaker,29,23
6287,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,5.0,positive,this is the very good product for it is cost perfectly fits to my samsung galaxy tab 101 real good purchase very happy with it i got perfect screen protector for gt-p7510 with very low price thanks for the great product i whould recommend this product for tab gt-p7510,48,24
6288,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,1.0,negative,this product is awful first of all they sent me screen protectors that were too small second two of them had pull tabs on the same side rendering the product useless lastly when i tried to see if it would fit there were bubbles everywhere if you try to push them to the edges the screen gets scratched,58,25
6289,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,they were exactly as they were described the fact that they swivel is nice i am actually going to order more because i lost these too,26,0

6291,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the ear loops do not hook to the jawbone as well as the original they fall off easily especially when trying to put the device on,25,2
6292,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,they come apart too quickly and will not stay on,9,3
6293,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,these were inexpensive replacements for the earloop that came with mine and my wifes jawbones they work at least as well as the originals and for me even a little better the earphone has a ball joint just as the originals had to allow you to customize the fit to your ear,52,4
6294,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,exactly what i needed for my jawbone bluetooth got another brand before but the clip was too large for the ear piece and kept coming loose this was the perfect replacement for my other jawbone ear clip that came with my bluetooth packaging was secure thanks for a great product,50,5
6295,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,they do not swivel like the original ones did and quickly broke i had to put super glue on them so i could continue using them,25,6
6296,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,yes i ordered 2 sets glad i did because one broke the first day but having extras i was safe and the jawbone blue tooth is no good without the ear piece,32,7
6297,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,this is a truly inferior product both ear hooks broke with the first 2 days of use completely unusable and should not be bought by anyone wanting more than 1 days use a complete ripoff,35,8
6298,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,the plastic this manufacturer uses is too brittle both my earloop hooks broke within hours of using them one cracked on the partial circle that snaps around the bluetooth and the other will not stay together at the ball joint they fit on my jawbone icon which was my main concern when ordering so they would have what i need except the quality in manufacturing is very poor i would look at other manufacturers,74,9
6299,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,not good wasted my money they both broke within a week of receiving them this is one time i should of listen to previous post they where to flimsy the clip would not stay on the bluetooth e,39,10
6300,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,broke as soon as i tried to adjust it properly on my ear,13,11
6301,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these broke after only a few minutes of use i do not recommend several reviews mentioned this i should have listened i recommend buying directly from jawbone the original clip that came with my era lasted over a year it is a shame i lost it,45,12
6302,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these break within a few uses had to send replacement to husband away on a business trip he has gone through 5 in the last 2 weeks,27,13
6303,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,will not stay on bluetooth too loose to keep it from falling out of my ear,15,14
6304,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,great price you can not find these in any store,9,15

6306,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,does not work nearly as well as the original comes off all the time of the ear piece but better than nothing,21,17
6307,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,the only problem is they are too loose from the bluetooth,11,18
6308,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,purchased my jawbone icon bluetooth and just in case the earloop broke i decided to get these for my husband and i they are sturdy and feel better having made this purchase,32,19
6309,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,these clips are as handy as they are easy to leave somewhere unintended the units i received performed every bit as well as the original perhaps better,27,20
6310,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,keeps falling off my jawbone bluetooth better to get oem which is what i did that stays on pretty well you can see the difference in performance even although they look identical,32,21
6311,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,for the price the product is good the mfg price was very high works well on my ear piece would recommend it to anyone,25,22
6312,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with these i lost the original that came with the jawbone and while these look the same they do not stay on well at all it usually pops off when i try to put this on my ear and can not remove it without it coming off i would not order these again since they will not last they need to attach better,64,23
6313,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,my wife has small ears and likes the fit with her jawbone icon quality seems as good as the original that was lost,23,24
6314,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,harder to use than my previous one i could not tell from picture that they were stationary no swivel and do not fit well not worth the return shipping price to return will keep as an emergency spare,37,25
6315,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,help me to deal with my bluetooth much easily to answer calls when driving i used to have different ones but did not like at all because i have problems to placed on ear,33,26
6316,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,very dissappointed in quality clip that attaches to the ear piece is not tight enough and constantly comes off the ear piece when taking on or off,27,27
6317,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,too small and will not stay attached to the earphone you get what you pay for i would not buy them again,22,28
6318,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the loops are not deep enough to stay on the jawbone it is always pulling away from the jawbone i am always afraid they will fall off and i will not know it,32,29
6319,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the movable joint is very loose it does not stay in position this is not the same as the original that came with the bluetooth shipping however was great,29,30
6320,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,there good on my jawbone for a little while but i did find a better one a little stronger not so pron to braking,24,31
6321,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,i thought these would be more the like oem product they are a different type of material and fall off the ear bud often they work,27,32
6322,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,the round clip is not strong enough to stay on the earpiece all the time it comes off every time i try to adjust the earpiece on my ear,29,33
6323,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,i only wish jawbone had made these more substantial and adjustable as i have small ears I have lost 3 of these so far and sure do wish the price was lower,31,34
6324,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,waste of time this junk jawbones initial design causes the need for these in the first place which is required to keep the device on ear they fall off easily and are often lost then you get this cheap plastic junk which does the same thing will never buy a jawbone product again and recommend against it,57,35
6325,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,i do not know why but these do not stay on the headset it is difficult to get them to not fall off when you put the headset into your ear and they almost always come off when you remove it they are small and can easily be lost if dropped on the ground outside i had to superglue one on my headset for it to be useful at all,67,36
6326,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,1.0,negative,these do not seem to fit my jawbone correctly looks correct but fails to stay clipped on device when placed in pocket,21,37
6327,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,where the original hook was secure these are fairly loose and do not want to securely attach it is better then nothing barely,20,38
6328,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the ear loops attached to the device however sometimes falls off it does not fit tightly to keep on your ear,20,39
6329,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,2.0,negative,do not stay hooked on earpiece well come off so easily are easily lost very disappointed in this especially considering the cost of the jawbone in the first place,30,40
6330,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,quick shipping inexpensive but loose fit previous reviewer made same comment so i was warned i have a jawbone icon perhaps it fits oithers better too loose to properly hold earpiece in place,33,41
6331,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,earloops were a serviceable replacement for the original icon jawbone earloop that i lost although these loops have the same tendency to disconnect from the bluetooth on removal from the ear if you are careful it does not happen that often by comparison an earloop fromn the actual jawbone website will cost 3 times as much for a single earloop than what i paid for a pair from the amazon vendor,69,42
6332,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the hook falls off the earbud too easily if you place the earloops hooks and the earbud in your shirt pocket pants pocket or purse it can easily seperate otherwise it works well,33,43
6333,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,they are cheap like the original that came with the jawbone but feels like an exact replacement fits well and swivels just above the hook which some of the others on amazon do not has the same tendency to fall off,40,44
6334,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,3.0,neutral,the part that attaches to the ear set is too loose in comparison to the original ear hook that comes with the device,23,45
6335,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,5.0,positive,really great just like new ones that cane with bluetoothjust as comfortable as the ones that came with blue tooth when it was brand new tried to order from where i bought bluetooth but was told they were not avalable just think you can find anything on amazon,48,46
6336,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053EBBH4,4.0,positive,when you need a more secure fit these are a must have for keeping the headset from falling off your ear i do not use these very often since i like to take the headset on and off each time i use the phone if you prefer to have the headset on for extended periods of time you will want to have these they are a perfect match with the oem loops that came with my headset and you need spares as they disconnect from the headpiece and are easy to loose,91,47
6838,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,2.0,negative,I am sure it was just a fluke with this one phone but it did not seem like the battery would charge on it,22,0
6839,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,the phone was said to be new the phone had photos of a prior owner and phone numbers stored on the phone the battery did not hold a charge the phone is in my drawer as it could not be used I have owned the same model phone before it is not the model of phone but rather the,56,1
6840,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,this is the best phone i have had in 4 years two phones i had previously did not last me 6 months i have never had a moments trouble and am considering buying another for another line,36,2
6841,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,this phone sucks it is owned me for a year and I am glad to get rid of it i finally was able to get an upgrade and went with the galaxy 2 skyrocket it is the best phone I have ever owned i suggest you buy that instead and forget you ever saw this thing,52,3
6842,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,2.0,negative,did not even have it for three months and it stopped charging will not hold a charge will not even charge son is very sad was not even used that much just every other weekend when my son was at his dads,38,4
6843,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,very easy to navigate-my grandson loves it-easy start up would have liked it to arrive a little quicker than it did but definitely a good buy,26,5
6844,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,unbelievable i dropped this phone in it is case on a dirt road and to my horror watched a full size pick-up truck run over the phone i picked up the phone took it out of the case and to my amazement it was still working i immediately made a call and it worked perfectly i had a screen protector on it and that is a little scratched up but other than that you would never know it was in an accident the case is in rougher shape tire tracks and dents / scratches from the dirt road but it cost less than 10 so i will not mind replacing that,107,6
6845,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,the charger port was broken it would not charge so i had to charge it thru the old phone in order to charge the battery,24,7
6846,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,3.0,neutral,i was super excited to see people selling this particular phone on amazon this was my first official non-tracphone and i got it for my freshman year of college it worked perfectly for me and i had it for about 4 years before i started experiencing problems with it it seemed like a cord was disconnected or something because it works while closed but stops working when i flip it up this was fine i just taped it shut but then i could not text or call numbers i did not already have in my contacts i read reviews about this phone and there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the charging part of it but i decided getting the phone i was familiar with was worth the risk long story short i ordered this phone was super excited that it was new and still in it is box and put my old sim card in it this new phone does not charge the batteries i have used the charger it came with and 2 of my other chargers and it just does not charge it says it is charging but as soon as i unplug it it goes back to low batterie it is not the end of the world although i have been switching out the batteries and charging them with my old phone and then putting them back into the new one it is a bit of a hassle especially for long phone calls but it is worth it too me to have the phone i want i am sure when this one dies or i get sick of it i will probably upgrade to a better phone but for now i am happy with it,292,8
6847,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,4.0,positive,good phone slipped the att sim card and off it went no complaints great reception for voice calls typing is easy text messaging a breeze smart phone nope great call quality and competent texting phone definitely do the math and take into account the att 3600 activation when you get that free upgrade which includes a new 2 year contract at the higher subsidized monthly rate before you have to sharpen your pencil you will realize this phone paid for itself in under 3 months do not hesitate to recommend it highly if this is what you are in the market for,100,9
6848,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,2.0,negative,like this model of phone but we had this particular phone a short while when it stopped charging correctly now it will charge sometimes and sometimes it will not of course it was too late to send it back at that point ordered a new one from a different site so we will see how that goes,56,10
6849,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,5.0,positive,these are our second round of these phones they are easy to use do great on battery life text internet talk but you do not have the ridiculous bill like a smart phone each phone last about 3 years as our primary phones will buy again when the current ones die,49,11
6850,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,3.0,neutral,the problem with this phone is the battery does not hold a charge always keep it as fully charged as possible,20,12
6851,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,3.0,neutral,phone works fine as long as you keep the battery almost fully charged all the time or it will just quit on you for this reason i bought another battery,30,13
6852,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005SHTQD2,1.0,negative,i bought this phone to replace my wifes other samsung strive that finally gave out after almost 3 years we were happy to find this phone still available for purchase it was sold as new but we had problems with it the very first day within minutes of turning it on it shut off and we could not get it to turn back on we let it charge overnight and the battery showed a full charge but in less than an hour the battery was dead we tried another battery same thing we tried a different charging cord in a different location the phone just would not allow the battery to charge or hold a charge then the phone shut off and we could not get it to turn back on at all we returned it i do not believe this phone was new but possibly refurbished i was very disappointed with this purchase,150,14
6953,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,it seems great in concept but once you clip it onto the vent forget about it when i tried to remove it to move it the clips broke and now it is useless,32,0
6954,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,i loved using this cradle for the phone but it was hard to put on the vent and even harder to make it stay once i did it worked great for about a week but it kept falling apart I am thinking about gluing the thing together and then trying it i like the concept but needs to be more sturdy but for the price I am not complaining,67,1
6955,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,5.0,positive,i ordered 2 at the same time one for me and one for my husband then i ead proir reviews i got a little worried but it holds my phone perfectly as it charges love it,36,2
6956,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,the charger works the vent mount works sure i could pay 5 times as much for a higher quality vent mount that might work better but i do not think it would make a difference this mount grips my phone perfectly to hold it still and nonetheless allow me to slip it in and out it adjusts for just about any phone and it grips with these two little foam pads on each side that probably will not squeez any buttons it has an folding piece in the back that let us you change the angle a bit sure it is a bit loose if you push it up it will dimount because it is made from two pieces and i must admit that while adjusting it i kept making mistakes and endend up breaking one of the clips who cares it still works and i almost feel like i got the charger for free,151,3
6957,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,better than i thought it would be the top clips secured the device on to the air vent there is a part on the bottom of the back that pushes the phone straight up and down the clip on and off part works great but there is a lot of movement if you try to press hard against the screen but overall it is good for the money if it was 30 I had give it 25 stars,76,4
6958,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,a piece of garbage for a car vent mount holder the pieces do not even hold together thank god i did not pay much for it and it was not new although it was advertised as new,34,5
6959,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,this product was ok but not what i expected it is kind of light and it is not strong at all very light can not hold the phone very well however it is will have to due until i find something better mark berry,40,6
6960,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,is ok the actualseems a little cheaply made however it will hold the phone securely through the vent which is really all i need it for i would recomend this product to others especially considering the inexpensive cost,41,7
6961,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,4.0,positive,I am quite pleased with my charger and phone holder it keeps the phone intact nicely and the charger is very nice as well,23,8
6962,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,installation was pretty cumbersome because the clamps do not fit well in the vent once i had it installed the phone kept swirling from right to left depending on traffic also i could not rotate the phone high enough to get a good view from the driver seat i got tired of it and wanted to remove it but even that was hard would never buy it again,66,9
6963,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,the charger stopped working on day 2 and the mount sits in the vent so it slids from side to side while you make turns while driving i threw it out,31,10
6964,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,my review is more for the holder than the charger the charger died after couple months but i was not surprised both only cost 7 what can i expect i like the flexibility of the holder it can fit different phones mine and my husbands and i like that i do not need to change the holder now i got a bigger new phone it sits a bit wobbly on the vents but there is a little stand at the bottom to let the whole thing sit on a solid surface below the vent slots when you go over a bump it can move a bit but the phone is stable in the holder the holder allows me to use my phone as navigation and i can see it perfectly while driving,130,11

6968,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,3.0,neutral,pros affordable easy to use easy to install cons depending on the angle and shape of vent the car vent mount may or may not remain intact another negative point is that the car vent holder is not tight when turned from left to right as a result if you take a sharp turn the product will shift the same direction,61,15

6991,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,i got this stuff with the basic expectation of using it with my galaxy s2 but it appeared total waste the car charger does not actually charge at all and it has co connection with s-2 it looked just like any card charger like old ones so may be that is why it is not charging and the stand is also use less i hoped to use the stand but it comes in 2 pieces the stand fits into the main piece but after that it is not stable i got this 2 weeks back and could not use it for a minute i travel lot so thought to use it as portable car charger and cell stand i will say big nooooooooooooo spend more and buy usable rather this is junk,131,38

6996,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,2.0,negative,the charger works just fine no complaints will continue to use the mount is pretty pointless it is made of two pieces that very loosely fit together it also loosely sits in your vent it flopped left and right with every turn it also fell out many times this is not just annoying when you are using a gps but dangerous when it falls under your feet this was the most that my phone has ever had a fall the only good thing about it is the open / closing mechanism seems decent and the soft grip held my phone well,99,43
6997,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006D7QKBC,1.0,negative,i was originally looking for a car charger and a window mount for my phone but when i saw this i brought it thinking it was a perfect deal until i got theand realize it was a air vent mount the air vent mount may work for some cars or for people that never takes it off but lately people are starting to break car windows in my neighborhood if they even think you have a piece of anything that may be related to a gps the air vent mount was cheaply made and too difficult to take off spent an extra 2 bucks and get a window mount,111,44

7380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,2.0,negative,i was looking for an extended battery without the bulk for my epic 4 g touch for a while i came across this one but was hesitant because there were no reviews on it i was able to find some reviews on xda which were hit and miss on this battery well i have been charging and discharging fully for about 2 weeks and found that the battery is about the same as the stock 1800mah battery with 500mah more than stock one would expect to have about 20 - 30 more battery life but this one come up far short if it improved i will add update but for now i would recommend another battery than this one,116,4

7383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,1.0,negative,had a lot of difficulty getting my phone or external charger to recognize the battery was present much less charge it managed to get external charger to recognize for one full charge after charged it did last longer than my original 1800 mah battery however because i wanted to condition as instructed on amazon page i allowed it to fully discharge before connecting it to a charger again now it will not recharge at all in either phone or external charger now I am hoping for a refund or exchange to see if this was just the one batter a single charged use is not what i was paying for like thebut the battery needs work,117,7
7384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,I have purchased several aftermarket batteries and have been disappointed with thier performance but ever since my s2 upgraded to jelly bean the battery performance as been horrible so i decided to try this battery with it is higher mahs out right out of the box the battery is a bit heavier that the oem batteries that i have which i consider a good sign it is not going to make the phone significantly heavier or anything but the added weight in my book means that there is evidence that this battery really does have more juice in it anyway i was getting 4 - 6 hours out of my phone prior to this and I am back over 8 hours using this battery so I am very pleased with the result,125,8
7385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,took a while to get here but it doubled my battery life without making my phone huge and ugly perfect for the price i paid,25,9

7388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,1.0,negative,i purchase this battery for my samsung galaxy s2 sph-d710 from boost mobile i was trying to find a miracle battery so i do not have to buy the thick battery with a thick cover unfortunately miracles do not happen if samsung did not came with a 2300 mah slim battery is because it is no way to make one to fit using the same cover i fallow direction from vendor and the first week i was happy and impress the second week i was kind of wondering what happen with the 2300 mah at the third week i gave up the battery never gave me more hours or power to say it is a 20 - 30 more life time the reason i gave one star is because after i complain to the vendor they without a question send me a credit i still looking for some company who can build this battery with a real cell to hold the more than 72 watts we need to have at least 20 hours of battery after used the phone like a phone,177,12
7389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,4.0,positive,i made the mistake of not properly conditioning my orginal oem battery so as it was on a normal day without my kids playing games i was lucky to keep a charge beyond 400 pm it was to a point where if i could plug in a charger and use it i did i was considering getting a larger battery that would require a new case adding bulk to my phone however I am glad i went with this one under the same conditions as before and with a properly conditioned battery I am able to maintain a working charge well after I am on my way home 630 pm in most cases when i get home i usually have 10 or so left by the time i go to bed 1000ish the phone is pretty much done assuming a do not use it much after I am home but the combination of properly conditioning the battery and the extended life are just about perfect for my needs during the week on weekends when i hand off the phone to the kids or with heavy use i need to put it on a charger around 2 pm to get throught the day considering that i did not add bulk to the phone and I am not tied to a charger throughout the day I am very happy with it,221,13

7399,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006THW4RA,5.0,positive,i see there are a lot of doubters out there but i had this battery for a few weeks i went through the whole charging and fully draining process 3x and my battery consistently gives me twice the life of the old one of course this is comparing it to a year old battery but it is still impressive the size is slightly bigger then stock but will still fit in your stock compartment get it you will not regret it,79,23

7422,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,2.0,negative,my old cover was broken so i decided to check amazon for a new one i really liked the purple lily design a lot and used my points to order the cover in a hast i overlooked the detail regarding thebeing shipped from hong kong at the time i wrote my original review i had not received any notification regarding the status of the shipment shipped tracking numberand decided to contact the shipper regardig the status he / she asked that i allow more time to receive if i do not receive by the deadline i would be allowed to get a refund for my purchase the cover came week or so later but was not what i expected based on the picture the cover seemed to be a glossy plastic thereceived is a matte white plastic and holds onto all dirt,144,21
7423,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,3.0,neutral,this is very cute functions fine but it is very slippery and can easily fall out of my hands not again,20,22
7424,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,2.0,negative,did not like it because it did not close all the way it is not as pretty in person as on the computer screen,22,23
7425,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,4.0,positive,i really think the design for this phone case is very pretty main reason why i brought it it was also one of the only non-rubber cases so it was not so plain and boring i like it alot and would buy more if needed,45,24
7426,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,4.0,positive,i really like my new purple case it looks just like the picture and for the price you can not go wrong it is made of plastic so do not think it will protect your phone from a hard fall but it is very pretty to look at,44,25
7427,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,5.0,positive,this product is as described and fits exact it is almost unreal quality for the price i paid for this product another plus for the seller is this is free shipping for free shipping normally it would take like at least two weeks for anything to come in but this one arrived on time and within 5 business days,58,26

7430,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,4.0,positive,i received the phone case really quick the design is just as shown on amazon and it comes in two pieces that click together over the phone getting apart takes some tough prying could not use my own fingernail but when dropped on the ground the pieces go scattering laughing out loud can not complain tho for the price i paid i really am satisfied,61,29
7431,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006VXWTW2,5.0,positive,i love the design it looks great on the phone and feels nice to hold the shipping was fast and I am very happy with the purchase,26,30
7448,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,i liked the design of this case it was solidly built and if had a good feel on the phone but the design is applied horribly to the case it looks like a clear case with a sticker on it the design is supposed to go all the way around the sides but it stops short and looks cheap,59,0
7449,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,i was really excited about this case but when i received it it did not look the way i expected the image looks like it was stretched to fit the dimensions of the cover so not only does it look unrealistic it looks pretty stupid the dimensions of a cassette tape are not the same as an iphone so it looks strange when you see it which is not represented by the picture good thing it was cheap,77,1
7450,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,of course this cover is wicked cute who does not want their phone to look like a cassette tape from their youth be warned however that this case is not in the least bit protective there has no bumper of any kind it is purely for looking awesome which it accomplishes well,46,2
7451,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,not what i expected it looked very real in the picture but when i was not so real in fact i do not like,24,3
7452,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,true it is hard plastic and husband works as welder it has taken a lot of abuse ppl really think he has talking to a cassette tape,24,4
7453,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,thiswas causing a glare on all photos taken had to take a black sharpie andon the case around the camera hole to stop the glare other than that it is a good case,37,5
7454,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,horrible received the product thinking i could actually use it for some sort of protection wrong it is literally the cheapest kind of plastic out there the sticker or whatever they put on it does not even go all around the edges / sides of the product once you put it on you literally have to pry it off with something plus the edges of it are extremely sharp which makes it even harder to take off does not even look good unless you are going on a spending spree for things ugly things you will never use you should not even consider this product,97,6
7455,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,not a synthesized cassette like the cute rubberized ones you see out there if you went to a website like cafepress and uploaded a picture of a cassette face to an iphone cover this is what you would get yes it is basically a picture of a cassette on the back of an iphone cover you will not get that are you carrying around a cassette reaction because it is rather clearly an iphone cover and not well a cassette the good it is hard and does not flop off if you really hate that the rubberized cute ones fall off but you just want the image of a cassette without your phone being morphed into one you can buy this case it is not really worth me returning it so sadly i will try to bestow it on someone or recycle it not a fan,141,7
7456,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,it took about 3 - 4 weeks to get to me which sucked since I am an impatient person but that is not really the worst part when i receive the phone case i immediately put it on my phone it did not fit i have a 4s and the case is for a 4 does not matter since the 4/4s are the same size so it should have fit but one side just did not reach all the way around to latch on my phone completely i will not bother returning it since it is a cheap case anyways and identification most-likely have to pay for shipping the picture of the cassette was not all that great either but i expected that oh well with it being so cheap you get crap quality so i would not recommend this to anyone,131,8
7457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,bought this for a friend who needed cases he liked it it is working for him can not complain it is doing it is job,21,9
7458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,love the versatility for those kids who never had to buy a cassette tape this case is perfect for you,20,10
7459,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,i was less impressed with this cover because it just looks like a picture slapped on hard plastic it is look is ok but nothing great,25,11
7460,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,i liked the design I am old enough to remember owning many of the real thing the price was not bad at all and the case arrived much sooner than i had anticipated however the picture printed on the case is slightly diagonal and stretched toward the end it would not be so obvious if it were not for the fact that the numbers are printed there,62,12
7461,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,this product is lousy you definitely are paying for what you recieve the print looked horrible and the plastic would hardly withstand a good fall do not spend your money on this case,34,13
7462,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,this is not even a printed decal it is like a copy-machine copy of another case this thing is a joke the plastic / rubber is also really flimsy the phone will slip out easily,33,14
7463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,do not waste your time and money it is literally a picture on a piece of plastic a very cheap piece of plastic plastic pos,23,15
7464,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,i have dropped my iphone several times in this case with no damage to the phone plus i love the reaction i get from people when they think it is a cassette tape,33,16
7465,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,it was not protective of my iphone and the design on the case looked like it was printed on badly,20,17
7466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in this product of the three covers i ordered this one took the longest to arrive when it finally arrived the cover was very distorted so much so that it does not look like a cassette it made me sad because of the three it is the one i really wanted i would have returned it but i felt it was not worth it because it was 2 i would order another one but i do not want to risk getting another bad one,83,18
7467,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,this is such a fun case everyone thinks my phone is actually a cassette tape when the back side is side up i really enjoy it,26,19
7468,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,it is better than the average cassette cases you see because those are hard to get in and out of your pocket whereas this case somehow still has a soft unique texture but goes in and out of your pocket so easily slim fit does not make your phone look bulky at all but it is just a picture on the back not actual cassette looking which is fine with me arrived 2 weeks before estimated delivery date d,77,20
7469,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,i love this case i show it off to everyone looks so real and was super cheap I have even dropped it a few times and has not cracked or chipped,29,21
7470,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,the design is great i get a lot of compliments on it but it is overall manufacture is just average at best,21,22
7471,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,these cases r to be expected based on what was paid for them they r really cool and my son enjoys his,22,23
7472,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,love it but it is really hard to get case off while on the phone great case although would order again,20,24
7473,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,thisis plastic buy perfectly priced and stylish i would definitely purchase again from same vendor / brand much better than the overpriced store versions,24,25
7474,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,it came weeks earlier than expected and it is a really cool case just a bit tricky to remove overall although great purchase and so affordable,25,26
7475,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,you should not buy this if you have high hopes for a phone case it is just a plastic back to your iphone and it will not provide much coverage or protection fr your phone however i take pretty good care of my phone and this case does it is job for me i was just looking for a cool looking case that would not make my phone feel too fat and would not hurt my wallet this works just fine,75,27
7580,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,first can you really go wrong with the price of this phone case the inner rubber jacket fits very snug on the phone the plastic snap on fits easily around that but i got this one because i liked the look of it comparing this to my last otter box the rubber jacket fits better than the otter box this plastic jacket is a little bit more flexible than the otter box but it stays in place without a problem i would purchase this for my next phone if available cons rubber catches on pocket a little headphone jack cover is a but hard to open pros fits snugly great value charger speakerphone and more openings in correct place does not interfere with power and volume buttons,126,0
7581,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,i received the case yesterday i just took it off today on my way home from work the case is larger than it looks in the picture the phone is very thin and this case makes it bulky and it fits a little sloppy the mesh product is a cheap feeling plastic and all in all this products looks and feels cheap while driving home i tried to plug my aux cable into my phones headphone jack which is covered by a little tab on this case the tab is super flimsy and fits down flush with the rest of the case so every time i lifted it up it kept flopping down and i had to wait until i reached a stoplight to plug it in very disappointed I had steer clear,132,1
7582,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,it look like a great case but when it arrived is was the wrong case for the wrong phone what it explained in the info was not what i got a moto x case with flower print on it not all not for a galaxy s2 and,47,2
7583,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,this is a very nice case for the money i actually bought two of them the first one broke after my son tried to take it off the wrong way but that was our fault,37,3
7584,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,product fitted well and it wad delivered promptly but as other reviewers stated the case is not meant to be carried in the clothes except for jacket pocket or a purse is you carry one so i junked it and got a genetic plastic case,45,4
7585,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,very brittle and fragile it broke and fell apart after some time,12,5
7586,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,3.0,neutral,the hardshell is nice strong and durable but does not fit the phone without the mesh cover it will not stay on and continues to come off very irritating,27,6
7587,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,3.0,neutral,i used this for a few months with much frustration waiting to find the seller where i had bought the hard case for my phone this case looks like it is going to be amazing not so much it did not fit my phone well when i had both parts of the case 2 separate pieces on the phone it would be difficult for my to use my power cord I have since replaced it and will not order one again i do not think this phone fits the skyrocket sii well,87,7
7588,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,i did not want to spent a lot for a case on an older phone and I am pleased with this purchase,20,8
7589,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,i had an otterbox defender case on my phone before this and since the rubber piece was on the outside it srltreched alot and i had to get a new case instead paying alot of money for that case i bought this one and I am very impressed fits on my phone perfectly and all the buttons and everything match up i like that the plastic is on the outside so that way it makes it easier to get the phone out of my pockets the only problem i had was the headphone jack cover it is kinda hard to open and it is very flimsy if i gets annoying il just cut it off but otherwise the case is better then my last one shipping was fast too it arrived within the estimated time so it was not late or early,138,9
7590,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,did not fit tight it was rubbery and got caught in pocket the plug in cords did not fit with case on had to buy another case for phone,27,10
7591,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,excellect case especially for the money we paid one of my sons picked it out and when it came my other sons wished they had asked for it as well,30,11

7595,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,this case is reverse of the other cases hard she shall outside and the rubber cover cozy inside backwards from all the others but it works perfectly,26,15
7596,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,i received a case that was not even for my phone it cost less than a dollar so it was not worth the hassle to try to return,27,16
7597,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,4.0,positive,this is one of the best looking cases out there but it is not of the highest quality after a month of use the matte black finish own the mesh part of the case is wearing away you also have to be careful when removing the case as the mesh part cracks if it bends too far for the price great case,62,17
7598,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,fits great around my phone like the texture so it does not slip out of my hands like my last case did,21,18
7599,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,3.0,neutral,i like the case for my skyrocket just does not provide the best fit needs to be tighter to fit my phone,21,19
7600,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,5.0,positive,great product for 68 i know right this thing has done a great job of sealing my phone protecting it and it is very easy to come on and off for cleaning seeing as how i am going to be upgrading to the s3 soon i did not want to spend too much money on this great case for the cash or cents i should say,64,20

7602,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,it is not what i expected the molding is cheap it falls off the phone looks pretty on the screen not quite right on the phone,25,22
7603,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,1.0,negative,still awaiting my purchase do not understand why it is taking so long never waited this long for any of my others purchases before,21,23
7604,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007GT2T0C,2.0,negative,the case is nice especially for the price about 2 but it did not fit my at and t samsung galaxy s2 as it advertised I am very disappointed i think it is designed more for the skyrocket it would have been a hassle to return it so i just kept it I am just glad i did not pay a lot for it this is why I am leary about buying things online without having to try it out first,75,24
7605,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,not use it yet but sure i will like it the fact that i will not have to carry a mirror with me is appealing,25,0
7606,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,the glare is terrible it also smudges and leaves tons of fingerprints my screen looked terrible i let it be for about three weeks and then threw them away,29,1
7607,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,i could not stand to keep it on my phone it kept bothering my eyes i loved how it looked when i first applied it but as soon as you go to use your phone it is very hard to read texts and more only thing i can suggest is if you bought the case already you might want to put it on the back of your iphone to use that as a mirror,71,2
7608,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i love the mirror screen protector serves me so many more purposes than just protecting my screen it is a mirror laughing out loud,21,3
7609,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,pros very easy to install do not need to worry about bubbles at all you do get a mirror effect cons very severe and annoying rainbow effect make it hard to see the content when the screen is turned on,37,4
7610,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,some people complain about how it looks after it is put on and yes it is a little harder to see buyou get used to it and for me the look of the mirror is more than worth it i love these things,42,5

7613,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,this product came in earlier than it said and the mirror effect works great when your using your phone it is like haveing an ordinary screen protector for the price and quality i would recommend this screen protector,37,8
7614,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,it is really hard to see through the screen if your outside or in an area with alot of light it is really more useful if you are going to use it as a mirror,32,9
7615,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,not what i expected it was way too much glare my eyes could not handle it,15,10

7620,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i love these screen protectors i have an iphone 4s and other than protecting my screen the mirror is actually really great it is not like those weird mirrors that you can barely see yourself in it it is kind of hard to see outside when it is daylight but what did you expect it is a mirror screen either you want a good mirror that looks kinda bad or a bad mirror that allows you to see your screen i do have a white iphone and it looks lavender purpleit is really easy to apply it is like a colorful screen in a way but i love it i no longer have to carry a mirror in my purse i just turn off my screen and there it is,128,15
7621,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,these are honestly kinda dumb they are cool for the first day but soon hurt your eyes and make it tough to see your screen,25,16

7623,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,worked very well but could never see my screen when it was on and my eyes started hurting after using my phone for about 10 mins and gave me head aches so becareful with these,35,18

7629,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,i had to always turn my brightness up all the way and also it made the screen look pinkish purple,20,24

7678,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,4.0,positive,great pros exactly what i asked for cons does not work in the sun / outside even with brightness all the way up and gets dirty easily duhh i also do not know if it is supposed to be over the camera or if i remove that part so now my pictures for my rear view camera are strangely tinted and last but not least there is a rainbow type effect but it is not too distracting i only noticed it the first time i am satisfied and the shipping was quick too,89,73
7679,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,it is a really great product and the tittle says it all but i did not like how it kind of makes you feel a bit dizzy,26,74

7682,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,my opinion about the mirrored screen protectors are for people who need to check themselves out when you are outside you can not see through them and it is impossible to take a picture if there is any light outside,39,77

7689,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,it was not what i expected this is really like a mirror so shiny when the phone is off i like that thing but when you turn on the phone you can not see the screen clearly you can see like rainbowand makes my eyes hurt and tired especially you can not see well outside it is much better just using regular one,62,84
7690,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,his screen protector is unpleasant and hurts my eyes while i used it on my phone every time i got a phone call it would be mission impossible to pick it up of press the green the answer put-on,39,85

7731,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,i gave it 5 stars because when i received this package not only late but it was horrible and nothing like the description the company sent me new ones right off and i got them within a few days the replacement ones were perfect so much better then the first ones i still have then and the one on my screen with the first ones it was hard for me to see the screen without having the brightness fully on but that quickly killed my battery and in my line of work i could not have that the new ones were so different they were perfect came quickly the screen looks amazing and i get compliments on it all the time i honestly bought them for fun but i use it everyday i highly recommend then as long as you keep in mind where your getting them from and if there is an issue talk it out with the company they are such great people to work with,167,126
7732,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,looks better on a black phone very difficult to see what has on your screen while outside on the sun will not purchase again,23,127
7733,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,this case made my screen dark and i did not even use it the mirror did not even worked that well do not buy,21,128
7734,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,4.0,positive,good protectors but makes it hard to see my screen in the daylight they are pretty cool although they are still very functional and save your screen from scratches,29,129
7735,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,makes it really hard to see the screen and it gave me a headache to look at i took it off after a day,24,130
7736,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,works great as a mirror but have not really tested the durability of the protective feature i hope i never do either i use a mirror screen protector on all my electronics and I have only had one incident in which it actually protected the screen a pair of pliers fell on my ipod and it did manage to protect my screen although i had to replace the screen protector after that I am all for screen protectors i buy the mirror ones because it doubles as a compact for me i give it 5 stars for serving it is purpose,96,131

7771,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,it works as a screen guard but I have used mirror screen protectors before by different brands and they were of much better quality in that as soon as the screen goes on you no longer see the protector at all and fingerprints would be very faint on these although when the screen is on there is a constant glare from the protector and a rainbow sheen that makes it hard to see what you are doing especially during the day and fingerprints and lines stick out clearly so i find myself constantly wiping my screen on my clothes every time after i touch it the price is reasonable although and i suppose you get what you pay for at least my phones screen is safe,125,166
7772,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,1.0,negative,i have bought multiple mirror screen protectors over the years and these ones are the worst quality out of them all there are tabs at the top to pull off which should expose the sticky side to put on your phone when i tried to pull the first tab the whole thing was ruined the second side would not come off at all horrible quality,64,167
7773,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,is all good but you can not see a damn thing when you are outside in the sun is the most annoying thing ever not worth a penny,26,168

7775,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,3.0,neutral,i like the mirror reflection indoors you can still see your phone through the mirror cover however in sunlight it is very difficult to see and am debating on keeping it on because sometimes i can not see anything on my screen in the sun it is a good privacy protector although elsewhere,52,170
7776,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,5.0,positive,so mant times if i am just out to run a few errands i just put my phone in my pocket now i take along my lip stick stick and liner too,32,171

7783,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Z5Y702,2.0,negative,these are not worth the money first of all they are not easy to figure out how to attach then they get so dirty and you can not really keep them clean we got 3 and ruined the first 2 trying to put them on then the 3rd one was on for a weekend until it started peeling and looking tacky,60,178

8492,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,2.0,negative,there are too many disjointed parts to these stories it is as if the sex were written and someone thought other things should be added but no one knew what so random phrases were put in such as one lady who says she is helping people through my work but what does she do no one tells you the sensual parts are well enough written but leave you wondering how the protagonist got there as the story really does not suit such activity these are just disjointed sex scenes and the parts in the middle are so annoying they ruin even the sex the non sex parts are terrible and this ruins all the rest which is a shame,120,37

8526,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,the only thing this had going for it was the free price tag i skimmed through the whole thing looking for the hot sex scenes and never really found any i deleted it first chance i got do not waste your time,41,71
8527,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,4.0,positive,good stories for a free download a small collection although imaginative snippets of personal interaction between in other words if you are interested in a quickie pick this one up,30,72

8531,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,this book was just boring and i did not enjoy it at all it was very disjointed and was not even very erotic thank god it was free otherwise i would have wasted good money,33,76
8532,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,5.0,positive,i liked this book although i am ashamed to admit it i found it humorous because sex is really not like it is portrayed in the book it was a good book,32,77
8533,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,2.0,negative,many of the stories were weird they were not very erotic even when they did contain sex they all seemed to really be about woman sexual liberation the modern cover suggests a modern read but they all seem to be very old fashioned settings too,45,78
8534,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,4.0,positive,despite being more directed at a female audience it was still pretty good the stories were good and the excellent writing kept me hooked and you simply can not argue with the price all in all it was a pretty decent book,41,79

8538,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,3.0,neutral,entertaining but not too serious just enough erotica that a married woman needs it will stir emotions that you may have forgotten you once had,25,83
8539,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,5.0,positive,this amazing collection of erotic stories is one of the best I have read so far in any format print or otherwise the stories here do not just sizzle they burn and in some cases they burn enough to expose some surprising aspects of human nature if you read erotica regularly you know that some talk purely about sex the kind that makes people refer to erotica as porn and some use erotic language or stories to transcend that and talk about love and life this collection is the latter i particularly loved the last story it was hot quick and surprisingly poignant if there has any free erotica worth getting this should be it do not hesitate and press that button now highly recommended,123,84
8540,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,short stories were stupid and some almost juvenile sex with a chocolate dildo glad this was free and i did not pay for it i deleted it without finishing it,29,85
8541,Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,people seem to be attracted to reading pornography because it is often excused as not evil due to the spiritual ignorance of the masses for most people think of pornography as a movie or picture that involves ongoing copulation or even as softcore as removing the little blackouts from off the nipples well allow me to correct this ignorance fornication involves more than this for our lord jesus christ describes to look on a woman to lust after her is to commit adultry with her in the heart now take this same concept and consider your wicked immagination lusting after delights that are not your own nor should be do not covet is the command so consider getting your own husband or your own wife and not burn in your lusts for it is better to marry than to burn if your are one who takes pleasure in reading erotica or should i say pornography you should consider this in the same wicked fashion as a whorish movie or some prostitution house in the slums of town it is as although a man would walk into a strip club and desperately empty his wallet just to be let down and empied of his soul in the end these pornographic stories do nothing more than excite the lusts of your flesh and seperate you further from the god who created you to glorify him through holy living jesus christ can redeem you and save you call upon his name to be saved cry out for his mercy in the depths of your darkness for this purpose he was sent down unto us so that we can be set free of the bondage of sin [ ] turn from idolatry eroti is a false god [ ],293,86

8562,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this pathetically short story has a lot of problems not just incorrect word choice one does not bundle into someone for example but general lack of research and care taken by the author her description of water sports theand what he does to her are not particularly graphic there is no emotional connection nor did i feel the characters struggle of enjoying it and not enjoying it honestly i feel like the author needs to read more smut and then get an editor and then publish sloppy short and not particularly passionate,93,0
8563,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,does the word bidet call to mind flowery french ambiance where everyone trips all over themeselves to carefully observe the rules of etiquette and fine upbringing well forget that and brace yourself this is burning hot fiction that is literally dripping in passion from the get go the author takes us by the hand and guides us down little imagined corridors of domination and submission that involve all sorts of hardware and spraying attachments the imagery is dead on and you will squirm in your chair as gina opens herself ready and willing for all that maximum has in store for her short and almost unbearably hot,106,1
8564,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,i love aphrodite hunts writing style this is extremely naughty which would make most women blush but because it is so well written you get drawn into the story and the scenes are very dirty indeed this full-on style may not be for everyone but if you love authors like zoharah jay the erotic diary of a bored housewife the complete 6 volume series of compelling and erotic adult short stories who write intelligent but still very sexy short stories then this one is for you,91,2
8565,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,aphrodite hunt gets down to business immediately no beating around the bush a blond dude makes a co-ed sit on her haunches on a bidet rim holy double-p so much metal is used on her she can hardly walk if almost-painful master-slave play is your thing you would love it,49,3

8567,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,I am not sure what to think about this story yes it is short and it only gives you a glimpse of what the full story would be like it is kinda hot a little weird i did not like some of the descriptive words that were used they threw me off a bit all in all it is an ok read if you need something quick,62,5
8568,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,very abrupt no build up just got to the point very very very very very very very quickly what was i expecting in seventy some pages,26,6
8569,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,not to my taste which probably colors my opinion of the writing fair i imagine someone who likes that sort would rate it a bit higher but i can not imagine anyone rating it as great literature still i guess i got what i paid for it was free,48,7
8570,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,explicit sex story only about 40 pages read in an hour and continues with purchase of next book this was a freebie to get you hooked to buy the subsequent books sad that it could not just be put together to make a whole regular book,45,8
8571,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,the writer obviously has never seen a bidet i have had them in my bathrooms for 35 years simple cleansing and nothing like described in the book,27,9
8572,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,a decent erotica book but could have been much better with more character development,14,10
8573,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,interesting start to the series makes you wonder if all of the sex is worth the main female character getting in makes you want to buy the rest of the series to see but I am not convinced yet,38,11
8574,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,ok i know people get into the bdsm scene and all but this was just a foul mistreatment of a girl she was willing i know but still foul the ending was suggestive of even worse just boo,38,12

8577,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,okay that headline was not a true sentence from the book but it is what it sounded like in my head weird clit-run material for women w at least better taste than the shades of grey fan-fapperettes out there,37,15
8578,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,not any exceptiomnal material and I am not asking much but have some purpose to the action here pretty much exectly what it says for mega-bimbo to take on various adonis undergrads and who can not speak but mostly gruny come on you b how about some gratitude how about some emotion besides endless peak orgasmic metaphysical experiences,59,16
8579,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,this book is steamy steamy steamy and creative the bidet concept is great for this who are interested in reading about the bdsm world this is a quick powerful read that you will really enjoy if you are into power play this book will surprise you with what the main character is required to do but it brings you into a fantasy realm that you may not have ever considered it is heavy on the humiliation but that is what books can be for enjoying reading about things you would likely never do in real life just keep in mind this book is not meant to be reality it has an alpha male a submissive female and an intense story it is fiction and if you can enjoy it for that you will like it,132,17
8580,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,very short story defiantly written so you have to buy all the small books to get the entire story,19,18

8584,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,not worth it at all reading the stories from playboy are somewhat better than this and it is nothing but a teaser just not a very good one so no i will not be buying the rest of this book,38,22
8585,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,sexy but short and missing something I am going to try to get more by this author and see if things are better in another story,25,23
8586,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,that is right young ladies strap on those feather panties because it is time to squash your self dignity and respect and at the same time become the most popular girls in college the unfortunate down side is you will be branded an easy skank but a lot of women can live with that label right millions of women do it every day buy to get into this high profile club you have to be on display during your initiation so yeah it will not be your little secret because every one going to that college has a front row seat to your debunking congratulations ladies because any one can join and any one can watch because in this school we are all a bunch of depraved over sexed lunatics it makes me wonder what they do when men try to join laughing out loud,140,24

8589,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,seriously hot co-ed bdsm action or should that be bidet-sm explicit and full of action this story is a real turn-on and great to find a bit of bdsm with a few novel twists I shall definitely be coming back for more,43,27

8591,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,really ridiculous fantasy about sex and what men and women want it should be banned burned gotten rid of in some way it is drivel,24,29
8592,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,just awful just nasty i was sorry that i bought it and the whole series i deleted all of them,20,30
8593,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this improbable story line is strictly for the swooning heroine dominated by the cruel master crowd but may not satisfy even them the hoped-for emotional entanglement never developes so it just seems like bullying the writing is sloppy and the scenario is contrived i do not read much of this genre but even i have read better,56,31
8594,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,be warned this is a hard core erotic novella it is very short although i believe there are more installments but i barely could handle this one it was not enjoyable to read this type of story,36,32
8595,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,i am new to this sort of books and i thought it was well written and powerful i enjoy it and i could feel the passion and the pain when reading this it is terrible horrible and i can not look away i enjoyed this even although I am not sure why because it is not something i would normally enjoy i did the heroine is too willing to get into this club i bet it is not even worth all the humiliation the hero if you could even call him that is a complete and total alpha male i do not like him i do not like either character one submits too easily and one is too dominant,113,33
8596,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,5.0,positive,I have read erotica before but not like that it is very tantalizing and my body was feeling what she felt how this was written very deliberate and detailed down to the placement of chains and clamps all i can say is can i be initiated sounds like fun,47,34

8599,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,2.0,negative,never liked stories where someone is so desperate to belong that they do anything to get in an organization just was not into it,24,37
8600,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,i know bdsm i know humiliation play and i know very well all the devices that can incite pain and pleasure i made countless stupid mistakes in my youth so i get ginas desperate attempt to get into an elite club at college and i understand her willingness to do whatever it takes for entry into that club the manipulative man who takes advantage of girls in desperation he might be the only reasonable factor in the story a bdsm-virgin saying that 6 metal clamps on her sensitive area does not induce pain and only intense pleasure no the same girl also willing to be humiliated real humiliation have a strange man p on her while her private part is stretched wide open very far-fetched mindset hate to be the grammar nazi but one either removes clothes or takes off clothes one does not remove off clothes the writing is smooth in general that is the only redeeming factor,159,38
8601,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,this is a good start to a series i enjoyed the fact that the author dove right into the sex and did not waste any time with unnecessary background stories great twist on the nipple / pussy clamps also no pun intended definitely worth buying,42,39

8608,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,this is a trainwreck it is terrible horrible and i can not look away i enjoyed this even although I am not sure why because it is not something i would normally enjoy i did the heroine is too willing to get into this club i bet it is not even worth all the humiliation the hero if you could even call him that is a complete and total alpha male i do not like him i do not like either character one submits too easily and one is too dominant cover thoughts this cover is horrible but props for actually trying to fit the story it is complete obvious this is used by some really bad editing program,113,46
8609,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this was a complete waste of time i like lite dom / sub but the children shower was too much for my taste,21,47

8611,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,if you are not interested in submission / bdsm this is not for you i found this short story to be well written with the right mix of submission eroticism and bdsm a college freshman is looking to get into a highly exclusive club how far will she go you will have to read this quick but intense story will look for more from this author,64,49
8612,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,laughing out loud the things some people will do to get into an exclusive club bleh so not hot the writer seemed obsessed with bodily fluids a little okay but every other line or so bit much for me,37,50
8613,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,if you like a little domination and submission and to dabble in humiliation you will probably enjoy this short erotic initiation delight from aphrodite hunt i really enjoyed her attention to detail and interesting language the story was short but had substance and while it was not the best short i have ever read it was stimulating and exciting enough for me to ask what has next will i read the next piece in this series maybe if it was cheaper but i did enjoy it for what it was worth and damn what a creative way to use water,98,51
8614,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,it was ok for me it was not great but it was good to read if u like punishment and chains then you should read this book by aphrodite hunt I am looking forward to reading the next one,39,52

8619,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,interesting reading in my mind it is more a solo read however i did read it to my partner which had no real effect a touch to maleish for her,29,57
8620,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,this series crosses over into abuse i thought we were trying to stop this kind of cycle in this country,20,58
8621,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,1.0,negative,i really did not like this book it would more likely appeal to other persons it was not a romance but basically porn,23,59
8622,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,this story was a quick read that i enjoyed to the fullest i enjoyed the interaction between the characters and the sex scenes were hot i would recommend this book to my reading group as well as caught,40,60
8623,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,to say this short rocked is doing it a disservice it was full of vivid descriptions slightly questionable consent and hot action i felt like i was front and center watching it unfold definitely a good buy,37,61
8624,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,3.0,neutral,this short was filled with a lot for it is length the characters play their parts well and for the type of writing it is erotic short it gets you to the point as it should i think a little more set up would have helped to make gina and maxs characters more of believable and a little less stock characters but I am not sure that was the authors point overall i think this short deserves 3 stars and would earn a 35 if the characters were a bit more developed,90,62
8625,Kindle_Store,B005TVG1GM,4.0,positive,i am new to this sort of books and i thought it was well written and powerful i enjoy it and i could feel the passion and the pain when reading this,32,63
8626,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,i downloaded this book when it was offered for free i was not sure what to expect but by the end of the book i was very satisfied i would not have been disappointed even if i had paid for it it kept me glued to my kindle and i lost some much needed sleep over it the author kept me guessing till the end i did not know for certain who the enemy was the only downfall was that some parts did not flow smoothly and i did need to reread for clarification this book read part fairytale and part gothic romance will read this author again,107,0
8627,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,at times it seemed reminiscent of jane eyre but like other reviewers have said the heroine was rather dim-witted i understand the need to occasionally see past the truth for the sake of mystery but when all the other characters are able to connect the dots so quickly it leaves the main character looking stupid as i got it while on the free list i did not lose anything but time and i feel that the main character aside there was promise and talent to the writing perhaps i will try another from the author before giving up on her but i would not recommend this particular novel,107,1
8628,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,this is a gothic romance with a huge dark castle towers cliffs villains secrets and a resident ghost catherine is a 20 year old girl who because of a family misunderstanding was reared as a servant by her aunt and uncle in the united states her father sends his ward to retrieve her when he realizes that he is dying the story is in 1st person told from catherines point of view the dark lord jonathan is her fathers ward who is sent to bring her home her feelings about him gave me whiplash more than once she seemed taken with him upon meeting him sharing all sorts of information about her life but then she becomes intractable and uncooperative even although she has willing to return to her fathers house simply to annoy him why she as a 20 year old who has been cooped up in her relatives attic believes that she knows more about traveling the world than a viscount who has traveled around the world simply put catherine is stupid she is told repeatedly to trust certain people and yet puts her trust in those who she has the fewest reasons to trust she never asks questions never has anything explained to her and completely ignores the obvious by the time she stops being oblivious and gets some gumption the novel is nearly over it is a gentle novel suitable for the young but it is slow and catherine is an annoying heroine,246,2
8629,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,i love books that may have more to follow you get attached to the family and want to know how others are doing,23,3
8630,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,1.0,negative,if you want to read a book in where the heroine acts like a 2yr old this is the book for you i gave up just before 1/2 way and i am deleting this book from my kindle so i do not accidentally choose it again to re-read i kept hoping the hero would chuck her over the side of the boat or toss her out of the carriage and say good riddance i would rather give it zero stars,83,4
8631,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by how well i enjoyed this book it was interesting and suspenseful but somewhat short however i found it unrealistic for the two main characters to fall in love in the short amount of time they did i felt the woman was somewhat fanciful and silly for not putting the plot together somewhat sooner overall the book is worth reading and well written,66,5
8632,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,this reminded me of a victoria holt novel i really liked the story line romance ghosts and mystery and i liked the love-hate relationship between the hero and heroine the romance was tame but it was a pleasant read well worth the 99 cents i am glad that the author got a publisher and republished it,57,6
8633,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,while the story is well written and very gothic-esque i found the heroine to be too passive and very frustrating as far as I am concerned those who loved her put her through an awful amount of unecessary pain and suffering without some type of reaction from her at all there should have been some outrage on her part for being kept out of the loop not a bad read and better than most free kindle books but not great either,80,7
8634,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,loved these types of books lots of excitment in them they are back in time and it makes you love hearing about how things were in those years,28,8
8635,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,i think this story would have been much stronger told in third person and not first then we could have been given more insight to jonathan the mystery was also easy to solve i had the culprits pegged way before the end catherine was well off-base through much of the novel and sometimes i felt like shaking her still i found the tale interesting and a good clean read,69,9
8636,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,1.0,negative,i like dark romances once in a while that is why i downloaded this one but there had to be some redeeming qualities in the hero and this guy just did not have any even after he found our heroine was abused and lied to her whole life even after her life was in danger he was just plain mean and nasty to her and blamed her for everything and then she fell in love with him nope do not buy it our heroine was treated as cinderella by her aunt and uncle abused and unloved her whole life and yet the second she gets away from them she turns into a shrew acting like and treating people like her cousin treated her nope do not buy it very disappointed in this one and it had such great potential nobody grew emotionally nobody redeemed themselves nobody had a brain their head our heroine was supposed to be this intelligent person and yet she did some of the most idotic things throughout the book do not waste your time or money just not worth it,176,10
8637,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,1.0,negative,to start i love romance novels of all kinds i usually recognize amazing writing but i definitely do not find it a requirement in this genre however unless this book was written by a 13 year old I am shocked by the poor quality of the writing i cut my teeth on barbra cartland so know that i do not demand much additionally there is a big difference between naiveity and stupidity I am pretty sure the author does not understand this I am so annoyed with this book and so grateful that i did not spend money on it grrr,95,11
8638,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,4.0,positive,the dark lord weaves a story about catherine who was raised by an aunt and uncle after her mothers death and treated in the vein of cinderella jonathan is an orphan raised by her father and isto believe that she is a spoiled brat who does not appreciate the love and gifts her father has sent her over the many years as her father is dying he asks jonathan to go retreive her jonathan goes and he finds her in deplorable conditions he is unable to immediately put aside the years of hate although he knows that all the information he would ever known about her is wrong the story weaves a good albeit easily figured tale from here i found that as the story is told on first person it lacks some of the depth and therefore some of the heat that was potentially there i did enjoy reading it but would give it 35 stars which i have rounded up to 4 instead of down to 3,169,12
8639,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,2.0,negative,hardly another pride and prejudice not even a victoria holt characters thin plot a cliche lost heiress held captive by wicked aunt and uncle plus the ubiquitious malicious cousin predictably blond beautiful and spiteful enter mail-order tall dark handsome heathcliffe type who snatches heroine and returns her to her long-lost and of course stupendously rich titled father naturally despite having only known her saviour for a blink of an eye and having doubts about his motives our heroine realises she loves him ho hum meanwhile at the castle attempted murder mayhem mysterious assassins abound can she trust her hero or is he too after her money rapunzel is trapped in the tower cue the ghost saved by the humble but devoted stable boy who naturally is the bastard son of neighboring gentry our heroine avoids being thrown from her horse but falls of a cliff rescuing a dog that looks suspicously like paris hiltons oh no that is wrong like the one owned by that nasty cousin does heroine put two and two together and arrive at three people trying to do away with her duh implausibly given her inability to draw obvious conclusions our dim-witted wench unearths the motive for the attempts on her life in a daunting legal tome and equally preposterous after earlier brainless behaviour then goes on to outwit her would-be assassins putting an end to their nefarious scheme at this point the reader has asked several times why did the dastardly aunt and jealous cousin not do away with this twit when she was a child oops sorry now you know who done it as if you can not guess five minutes into this absurd tale and so onward we meander to the predictable revelations and wedding,290,13
8640,Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,5.0,positive,i loved the book from beginning to end yes it was a little predictable to me but when you read as much as i do what book is not i will definitely try more of the arthors work hugs and kisses all,42,14
8674,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i just completed reading crystal seeker book 1 i have also read other books by this author and must say that her writing has definitely grown throughout her books i thoroughly enjoyed this and can not wait to read more about tracy and her friends this book does not have a lot of romance just a smidge but it does have lots of paranormal what i liked most about this book was that the paranormal aspect is original nothing like anything i have ever read before and i read a lot i could not put the book down kept wanting to figure out the mystery,101,0
8675,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i really liked this book it was sort of skippy in places i would like to read more of this story,21,1
8676,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,took awhile to really get going it needed more drama for me not as much romance as i would like,20,2
8677,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i kept thinking throughout this book that it seems really amateur like a teenager wrote it my twelve year old is writing a book and it is more mature than this book i feel dumber from reading this when i read a review that said you can not even tell that a 21 year old wrote this i was like oh yes you can now it makes sense why i thought i was reading a book written by a young amateur hopefully she gains more experience before producing another series,88,3
8678,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,to much explaining very dry good books flow and are full of life not my opinion of this one sorry,20,4
8679,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,quite suspenseful but sometimes quite repetitive loved the concept of the story but some of the scenes seemed to drag on,21,5
8680,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this book was for my daughter she loves to read she liked this book and would recommend it to everyone,20,6
8681,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,good at some points and in some places it was hard to keep reading i read to read just for relaxation so it worked for that type of reading i doubt i will continue with the series,37,7
8682,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,it was an okay read slow to getting to the point spent to much time on descriptions of places to many repeats of past history of characters lost interest in beginning of book kept reading to see if it would get better but it did not get much better not purchasing next book,52,8
8683,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,it was good but it was not the best there were a few things i wished were changed like with chris and tracy,22,9
8684,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,nothing to say but boring badly written and very immature,12,10
8685,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this book proves to me that sarah swan is a great author the imagery of it is wonderful and vivid and i am so glad to have read the book i loved this series from the very first word my next goal is to finish the series thank you sarah swan you are an amazing author,56,11
8686,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,very slow reading hard to get into it nice story line and interesting to read just slow to get to the point,22,12
8687,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,I am really struggling to read do not think i can finish these just drag on and on and on with out any real direction too many plot paths and i do not feel that there is any growth in the characters this book has no element of belief to bring you into the books and keep you reading this author is too young and it shows in her writing she spends so much time on informing you about characters and then you never hear about them again or maybe you do 2 books later as much as i tried i can not recommend to read these books maybe this author will be better later on in life but right now it feels that I am reading a book written for a high school english class i would grade it a c-,137,13
8688,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,if there was a 1 that is what i would have rated this book first the author sarah swan writes 2 books for this seeker saga but she decides out of the blue that she has to busy with other things so there will be no book 3 but she says she might start a new series buyer beware sarah swan the author is not worth paying for any of her books and i would not you get engrossed then finding out the series stops at book 2,86,14
8689,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the premise was good but the dialogue failed the heroine may have been smart enough to get into the prestigious academy but she did not come across as an intellectual at all none of the characters seemed to have substance or depth if no one was talking the book went much better very difficult to finish as i stopped caring about the characters and their problems the poor friend back home never did get a decent phone call and why could not they access facebook or twitter sorry i purchased the second book before i read the first maybe i can return it,101,15
8690,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,found this book to be frustratingly slow and long with each action repetitively described over and over in a different way,21,16
8691,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this book i had knowwhat i was getting into because i did not read the back or little abstract of it but it was awesome I am so stoked to read the next ones,34,17
8692,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i find it had a strong storyline i also enjoyed the interesting little twists along the way curious to see if robs a nice guy or secretly a jerk as i suspect,32,18
8693,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,for a young market this is quite interesting but maybe a little predictable there is a lack of tension throughout that prevents me from reading further in the series but it is well written and may satisfy younger readers who relate to girl group dynamics theof the crystals itself is quite novel but the purpose gets a little confused along the way the second book may explain or fill in the missing bits but i probably will not read it,81,19
8694,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,do not bother the author gave up after only two books so we will never find out what happens so fustrating,21,20
8695,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,I have never read a story quite like this and i was hooked from the first chapter it was interesting and well done can not wait to read more love theof the crystals,33,21
8696,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this novel was decent it had quite a few grammatical errors in it but fueled my need for fantasy adventures great for teens / young adults worth a cheap thrill in this genre,31,22
8697,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,not so enthralling that you spend every waking moment reading it but definitely the perfect lunchtime or break time get away read,22,23
8698,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was ok after reading such terrible reviews i was sure it was going to be much worse but i did actually finish it my perspective is that the beginning of the book was much better than the end i understood exactly what she was doing until the moment she introduced the crystals from there she lost me i understand the pull to paranormal fiction and i think sarah has talent but thewas just too convoluted she went from this extremely descriptive detailed story line to a mashup of ideas all piled together the villain chris is so superficial and comic bookish he is so underdeveloped and the crystals what do the crystals do how did the one friend know so much about them it was a riddle and to be honest it was too confusing and vague to even want to find out more,147,24
8699,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the first chapter was great but after a while it became much weirder than what i ever imagined a mystery with magic and a cult club,26,25
8700,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i have had this book for a long time and i just can not get into it it drags on with anticipation giving very little detail about what has to come,29,26
8701,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was ok it was unnecessarily long and did not fully explain the role of some of the characters very repetitive and could have used a lot more details within the story i forced myself to finish it and was disappointed at the way it ended probably will not continue reading this series,52,27
8702,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i am so sick of seeing this cover be more original i have read 2 ebooks with this same cover i even have a blog post about books with this cover,31,28
8703,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,fair is all i can say just fair will not hold your interest long too many required words to leave a review,21,29
8704,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i bought this book because of the cover art but unfortunately found this book to be a very dreadful read with little to no action at all just a dull day to day living of the main character that has a hard time standing up for oneself and is easily bendable to others desires,54,30
8705,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i just got bored trying to find the plot as i thought it was slow starting yet also rather bizarre that parents would allow their child to be sent off to an island alone just could not get into it,39,31
8706,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,it was really good but it took some time to get into and did not get amazing un till very near the end but it was good and had a very good story line very happy,35,32
8707,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the writing in this book is a bit like a thesaurus threw up all over the page there were words all over and it was awkward to read,28,33
8708,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,you can tell this author is young it does not pull you in or engage you i will not be reading the rest of the series,24,34
8709,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the main character started out strong and independent but finished out by going against her thoughts and beliefs all for popularity and boys,23,35

8711,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,it did not draw me in it had a little bit of a pull but it was not strong i always found something better to do but it was a great book now for book 2,35,37
8712,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the book has many drawn out parts personally think it could have been written better but you should read it and judge for yourself,24,38
8713,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,is it a real possibility to use crystals for power some believe in magical elements and some just love there beauty but this is a great read a little slow getting into it but picks up in the middle,39,39
8714,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,there was only 1 big mistake she had ashley looking out for people and the she said ashley was sitting next to tracy and the g d word is not needed it is offensive in my opinion,37,40
8715,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,interesting story poorly delivered very wordy the author seemed to draw out scenes to make the book longer good character development,21,41

8749,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,the book has a good story line however it is very slow reading the action does not take place until the very end i like reading series so i will probably read the second book just to see what happens,39,75
8750,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this was one if the best books i have ever read it was exciting and had me guessing up until the last page i can not wait to start on the next one,32,76
8751,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,the book was good except for it could have been shorter because there was a lot of unneeded description by other than that it was a good book definitely worth 99,31,77
8752,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,a good read to pass the time but nothing superb or outstanding keeps you waiting for more but more never comes on to the second book maybe it will she had some light,28,78

8754,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i just picked this book randomly and it turned out to be really good I am looking towards reading the other books in the series,24,80
8755,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,when reading it feels more like a rough draft of a good bookit tends to be ongoing at times where it most definitely was not neededit had the potential to be an excellent book but it just is not therefor a free book it is what you expectit definite lynn leaves you wanting to read the sequel although I shall give it that,60,81
8756,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i liked this book looking forward to reading the rest of them i can not wait to get the next book,20,82
8757,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this was a great try for a first book but is definitely geared for middle school or younger as it is very obvious it is a first try a lot of pointless garble the mainfor the scy-fi is a little rough however not to dissuade the younger reader as it is enough for you to want to keep reading to see the end result and i know the writer will continue to improve,72,83
8758,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the first thing i want to say is this book does have promise i love thebehind it but unfortunately felt like it fell flat for me typically i finish a book in a day and i found myself struggling to to get back into this one over a period of several as others have mentioned it was pretty slow in the beginning not much happened in my opinion until the middle and even then i felt like the action was pretty lackluster i felt as if the characters were very underdeveloped as well at the end of the book i still felt like i did not know any of the them and some characters ex the doctor in the beginning are made out to seem as if they will play an important roll later on but are never heard from or seen again not to mention the fact that the so-called forbidden romance that i was so anxious to get into hardly played a role in the story aside from a few minuscule scenes only on of which contained anything even remotely romantic it was basically non-existent and the reason why it was forbidden was completely absurd to me possibly because it was never truly explained i was disappointed as a whole for me there was too much unimportant filler material and not enough of what was promised in the book description the only thing that kept me from giving this book one star is the fact that i really do like the concept behind the authors take on the supernatural otherwise it was a complete miss for me so much so in fact that i chose to return it part of me wants to read on in the series to see if it ever improves but at this point i highly doubt i will,305,84
8759,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i could not get into the story at all it is rare that i do not finish a book i can count maybe three times ever that i have not finished a book i started this was one of those times do not waste your money or time the book does not live up to it is creative and well thought out cover,56,85
8760,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,loved this book can not wait to finish the rest of the series it started off a little slow for me and i was not sure if i would enjoy it but by the middle of the book it had my full attention great read,43,86
8761,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,there were 5 things that made it hard to like this book 1 the author does not know the correct definition of the word penultimate yet insists on repeatedly using it 2 the line about butter being scraped thin over toast yeah tolkien worded it so much better 3 the main characters description of the old sailor at the beginning is quite racist she does not trust him because of his crude easten european possible russian accent if this book had been written in the cold war it would be one thing but it was not it makes the main character unlikeable right from the get-go and i therefore could not sympathise with her during the entire book 4 none of the other characters were particularly likeable either 5 the action of the book does not really begin until about halfway through as I had bought a bunch of books at once for my kindle i was not sure what sort of book this was supposed to be and by the time the plot actually unfolded it was hard for me to care i thought the concept for this book was interesting and the prose itself flowed decently but there were not enough things to like about this book to overcome the things i did not i will not be continuing to read this series or probably anything else by this author,225,87
8762,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,chosen seemed to go on and on and on without ever getting to the point i wish the author would have put some more hints or clues as to what the point of the book was i got 50 into it and finally just stopped reading it was well written in that the author was able to keep me reading for 50 without anything really happening seriously nothing happened,69,88
8763,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i really wanted to like this book but the plot was slow the characters underdeveloped and the writing itself was juvenile the author seems to just throw certain words around without them making sense or sometimes without the words fitting the tome of the book an example of it not making sense sounds exciting i said drily in my experience anything put together by anybody with a connection to administration ended up being completely moronic and lame you sound less than impressed the doctor quickly added with an equal amount of sarcasm he is not being sarcastic he is recognizing that she is not excited to go to the event however that could be me just being picky an example of not fitting the tone to my surprise the doctor laughed i was taken aback at first but then realized he was laughing gregariously rather than derisively it is as if the author was just trying to show off that she knew big words or perhaps she used a thesaurus i do not know and yes she did use that many unnecessary commas in one sentence and misspell the word dryly usually i can still read a book with things like this in it but it happens all the time i am a teen this book is aimed towards my age group and i disliked it strongly maybe they assumed that as teens we should not care about things like poor character development but we do,242,89
8764,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i wanted to like the book the story started out ok but it just dragged along several chapters in and nothing is happening and i find that i am not remotely invested in the main character i lost interest and tried to make myself read further but just could not do it,52,90
8765,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i just never cared about the characters the plot was slow with very little build up chris was predictably the bad guy but still played along like the reader could not guess worst book i have read in a while,40,91
8766,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,ok so personally this book was just ok to me it was too slow paced for the first half and there was too much repetition in tracys internal dialogue for me also i felt like there were a lot of events that were left unexplained and the characters lacked growth and depth as the story progressed but if you make it through this book the second book is great i really enjoyed the forward by the author that explains how she took her readers suggestions about the first book to heart honestly i think that she did a fantastic job catering to what her readers wanted the second book is believable fast paced and the characters actually grow and there has a lot of action in conclusion i give this book about 2 stars and the second book 5 stars so when you average that out it is a 35 stars for the series so far,154,92
8767,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was a fresh new concept there has vampires and werewolves and elves running around most of the young adult literature this one dealt with crystals the story was slow for the first 1/2 but the second half picked up the pace interesting characters and storyline not going to read the sequal as it is not pulling me in to want more i found myself scanning through a lot of the pages because i was not interested in the detail of her walking through the woods and more but if you have time and you want a break from the typical paranormal it is not bad but it is not great,107,93
8768,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,chosen takes a while to get going but after all the backdrop to the tale is in place the story really picks up I have never read something with quite as interesting a premise although i wish the author made an effort to make her writing tighter in places there has a lot of potential to the series and i already got the next book forbidden to see if it develops like i hope,72,94
8769,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i first got this book as the cover attracted me and i was very pleasantly surprised after finishing it every chapter has something new exciting and fresh it did not make me cringe at all like a lot of teen paranormal fantasy books out there actually made me very engrossed in the mind of the main character which is surprising becaues she has very special abilities like the others in the book which is a great supernatural gift i highly recommend reading this and although the start was slow it really picked up and the second book is a lot better too with so much action a great series to just get away from it all,116,95
8770,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i thought this book was great it was very well written and i felt liek i was absorbed by the story it was hard to put down and i was so drawn to all of the characters this was a great read for young adults eve was my favorite characters and I had recommend this book to anyone who likes ya,60,96
8771,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i gave this book an honest shot i read the whole thing and tried to enjoy it sadly i could not the description of all the characters was like a sexy romance novel no one had a consistant personality the crystal stuff just about put me to sleep and the only character i kind of liked was for some reason revieled to be the bad guy near the beginning of the book rather than in the end where it might have made some kind of impact i will not be reading the next book also the cover image it is so pretty and honestly part of the reason i wanted to read the book but that scene never happens there is even a point when the main character says she did not bring any of her nice clothes with her to the island let along a gown,144,97
8772,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,this book is marketed for teens but teens and older are bound to be disappointed writing style is very simplistic and the plot is dragged out it is a page turner but only because you will be skipping pages,37,98
8773,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,it took a while for it to get interesting seems predictable hopefully book two moves in a faster pace and fleshes out the charecters more,25,99
8774,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i read chosen few weeks ago on my siss kindel since then I have got my own kindle and decided to buy the book because second book has just been released its called forbidden forbidden the seeker saga and it is kinda hard to find in the store and i like to have all sequel together in on place chosen is fine book for young girls and it has just right amount of romance and only one kissing scene i am looking forward to reading forbidden as soon as i post this review laughing out loud,96,100
8775,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,otherwise i would have been mad about the money spent overall this book is just pretty lame there are many scenes especially but not only in the beginning that are explained in way too much detail and which could be cut short by several pages even if the pace picks up towards the end it does still not get riveting one major problem being that the story is largely really predictable it just takes the heroine ages to put two and two together always furtheremore the author resolves in too many cases to totally steoretypical and lame story elements oooooooh the island used to be an asylum way back then where prisoners were mistreated uhuh there is thick fog when the heroine already forgot here name tries to get onto the island and so on in the end the bad guy is hunchbacked for the rest of his life and swears revenge right bad guy with a hunch that is a new one not in general the bad guys ambition is not really clear nor explored except that they want power and money pretty shallow book without much surprises,192,101
8776,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,loved this book loved the story loved the writing chosen goes in my top-3 favorite indie books of the last year i can not wait to read the sequal it is already downloaded on my kindle,34,102
8777,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,i was expecting more but the ending does leave you wanting to know more i felt that by the time anything happen i was at 80 reading through the book and it was just too much of the tracy thinking this book is definitely for younger girls embarrassingly enough i am over twenty and the was not for me if you feel that you may like it i suggest to read it but it was not that great i finished it and will not be reading the rest of the series,91,103
8778,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,chosen the seeker saga 1 is a good story i recomed it for teen ager is easy to read it,20,104
8779,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i do not understand how this book got such high ratings the characters seem very one dimensional even the heroine who traveled over 3000 miles to finish her high school at a boarding school across the country is not strong enough to tell pushy high school girls to stop telling her who her friends should be she lies left and right to keep both sides from being unhappy with her i prefer a stronger female for asorry,78,105
8780,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,does anyone else actually believe that a parent would send their only child to a boarding school that they are not even permitted to check out first i mean come on for all they know they just sent their 16 year old daughter off with a child sex traffic-er,48,106
8781,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i have read yearbooks with a better plot this was like a bad tiger beat magazine mixed with a after school special from the 90s i was really looking forward to the concept of magic use in relation to crystals but found it hard just to follow the story line with out wishing the main character would get some counseling at some point and stop talking about which boy was cuter or who she had to be friends with in her new school by far not something i would read again or suggest to any one i know,98,107
8782,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,many people have already mentioned many of the flaws in this book i finished it but it was not because i felt compelled by the amazing plot it was more because i had to know if any of the pieces came together they do not spoiler the plot elements never come together the story line is trite and the characters are really boring there is all of thisup and it goes nowhere the reviewers that said this was well-written were being too kind it reads like a middle schoolers first story notebook i was not impressed i read a lot of yla and i was hoping for potential this is not worth your time,117,108
8783,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i bought this book based on the reviews i had read on amazon I am sorry to say it was massively disappointing it is an immature imagining of fantasy for teens many parts read like a middle aged woman trying to sound like a teen the plot was stilted and poorly paced and the ending was abrupt and poorly done I am just glad that i only paid 99 cents for it,69,109
8784,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,the story was slow the author spent too much time describing things on the island and not enough time on the plot nothing actually happens until almost half way through the book and the writing was somewhat juvenile i do not have any desire to read the rest of the series,50,110
8785,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this book is a good book but does not really end on anything the ending felt like it was hurried in order to not give too much information away so that she could write a second book also the love in the story was lacking she does have a little romance with someone but it is only for about 4 pages and then over this book is more of an action novel than a romance novel however i would recommend this book for friends but would not pay more than 99 for the book i will most likely read the second book of the series,104,111
8786,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book is so-so i thought that tracy was an intriguing protagonist and the world building was done fairly well i got a great sense of what a crystal seeker was and yet the author still manages to leave some mysteries surrounding these crystals in order to pique my interest because of this i just might read the next book another strong point of the novel is the authors writing the descriptions are wonderfully vivid and i can just close my eyes and perfectly imagine the island and boarding school now why just two stars then well for starters the bad guys of the novel are almost laughably stereotypical and as well-rounded as the female characters are developed the male ones are the opposite completely one-dimensional i also hope that the author will not be focusing too much on love in the future installments because in this novel it appears to be as although she has building up to a triangle or quadrangle whatever but love and lust falls flat here probably because the males are not developed enough and because I am tired of the whole love at first sight trope especially when it is obvious to the reader that the male romantic interest is no good at all for our heroine it just makes reading their scenes together painful if we are going to get invested in that storyline at least make the guy somewhat interesting another critique it is just very hard to suspend disbelief at the whole boarding school situation it is on a little island parents can not visit at all and yet they allow thei kids to attend overall it is an okay read that is only somewhat entertaining but it would have been much better if the villains were also better and the guys not so dull and simple,295,112
8787,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was a good book but not great i read it and finished it and i am interested to know what happens next but not dying to know this was not a book that i could not put down actually it was sorta boring intill about half way through i ended up really enjoying the book and i will read the next book when it comes out if i remember,69,113
8788,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i bought this book because of all the positive reviews and the tiny price tag i wish i had saved myself a buck and bought a bag of chips instead i hated all the characters and the writing was clunky and slow at best save yourself a headache and stay away,51,114
8789,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i am a fan of ya lit but this book was so silly it was slow boring and far fetched save your 99 and buy a book worth your time,30,115
8790,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,the writing in this book is not bad at first it starts off really drawing you in this book had major potential what i did not like was how the main characters do not really seem to grow as much as they seem to have multiple personalities some of them start off as terrible mean girls who suddenly are kind of cool and i will not spoil the surprise for anyone who still wants to waste their time but let us just say for me it was dissapointing and not developed the only action and it is not even exciting enough to be called action was in the last couple chapters the writer did a good job of making me curious and that is about all i was so let down with what was all revealed boring,130,116
8791,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,this book was slow to start but turned out to be great i can not wait to read the next book in the series,24,117
8792,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this was a good book i really enjoyed the story line as well as all of the characters there were many surprised in the book that i loved i love the romance in this book even although you do not get much of it this book is worth the read,49,118
8793,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,this book really took me by surprise as i search amazon this was in my recommendations bar i went ahead and took a chance to read something else other than what i must read and you know what i like it i had only meant to read just a chapter or two and before i knew it it was 1 am what hooked me to this book is the great plot line i am sucker for boarding school stories but also the fact that they are on an island i really enjoyed how with every new chapter more about the school and it is purposes are exposed the characters of the book were good each were clear with their motive from the start which was sort of strange and refreshing to read usually you have to read more to pull more of the characters out they did have secrets but it was not gasping i also adored the magic twist to it i read so many stories about powers and how the characters get them so when i read this twist i was intrigued and it kept me entertain till the end of the book overall this is a good book chosen is wise and witty with refreshing characters it is not like most book out there really different if your looking for a new twist in magic or powers read this book,229,119
8794,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,did not love this book but it was a good buy at 99 i would probably read it again and if you like young adult fantasy you will probably enjoy reading this,30,120
8795,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was pretty good i would not say it was the best ever it had an interesting premise and there was plenty of good imagery around the setting of the island the problem for me was the characters they fell completely flat i did not feel like any of them where good people and all of them were far to annoying and whiny they constantly felt like mary sue characters to me each of them acted just exactly as cliche dictates they should i will definitely keep an eye out for the next book to see if the character building improves because like i said this story has a very interesting premise,111,121
8796,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i liked this book alot i was not sure i was going to like it but I am glade i bought this book i liked all the characters and i thought it was different then any book I have read in a why 'll the book might start out a bit slow but do not let that stop you from reading it it speeds up sooo i would definitely recommend you read this book,70,122
8797,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,i probably would not have thought twice about reading this book but i was drawn in by the price after i went through a few other books from that 399 or less buying spree i dove into this one well i mean conceptually it is somewhat interesting but i could not stop thinking that this was a supernaturally tinted version of mean girls or something along those lines it does not have the greatest flow and can be choppy at times my biggest annoyance was the jarring switch from first person to third person when talking from another characters perspective the story is predictable and the characters do not always have the best depth but it is an entertaining read none the less,118,123
8798,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was sort of slow paced and tediuos i would not read the sequel unless i was really bored if your looking for an entertaining read this is not t it,31,124
8799,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book was way to slow for my taste thewas interesting enough but it left me feeling empty at the end also the authors description of the main characters thought process was way too drawn out it really was like being in the head of a teenage girl and honestly who wants to experience that again if your a girl,61,125
8800,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,after reading a few reviews i was really interested in this series and thought i would love it sadly i was more disappointed and at this time do not feel a great need to continue with the rest of the series i think the author tries too hard to build tension in spots where there really is not enough suspense or action to move the story along i always try to finish a book through giving it the benefit of doubt that it will get better but again i do not think chosen is strong enough or compelling enough at this time the story is based on tracey a high school junior relocating to an exclusive school on a remote island the island was a former prison and is supposed to hold hidden mysteries tracey is quickly sucked into a clique of friends who are secretly crystal seekers tracey learns she possesses the power to be a crystal seeker as well but tries to avoid and/or decline this magical gift during the story it never gives a clear grasp on what the magical capabilities are traceys new friends as well as the villain in the story are trying to use tracey in order to achieve greater power and rule the world there has an attempt at a bit of a love connection with tracey and robb but i felt that was lacking as well also the author tries to make the villain s more sinister and evil but i just felt that this missed the mark as well,253,126
8801,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i read this on my sisterss kindle and it was a fun read if i could go back and buy it i would to give the author some sales the cover is also enchanting i want the next one now ps i did go back and buy it on my kindle i loved the location the characters i thought it was so unique and took me out of my regular life i can not wait for more from this great author,80,127
8802,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,the young adult paranormal fantasy genre is full to the brim with high-quality writing well-planned story lines and engaging characters unfortunately this is not one of those books if you are looking for an average read to pass the time it will suffice but there are better stories available this is not one i would recommend even with the 99 price tag,58,128
8803,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this was a pretty interesting story the action seemed a bit jumpy and I am not sure i bought some of the characters motivations that said I am still interested in seeing where the author is going with this story,38,129
8804,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,this book was horrible after reading the twilight series the vampire diaries and all of the sookie stackhouse books I am always looking for a clever read this is not it not much character or plot development i feel dumber having read it,41,130
8805,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i bought this book because the cover is so pretty the writer does not always tell her story like a pro but i fell in love with the characters and over all the book was so much fun a great escape from regular life i will be looking for the next book,51,131
8806,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,let me start by saying that i really enjoyed this book but it took me awhile to get into it please do not give up reading it really does not start with the action until after the 50 on kindle but do not let that stop you because the action that does come is amazing I am really into ya and paranormal romance novels but i get bored really quick with the same vampire fairy angel werewolve story this is not one of those stories at all the basis behind this story is a completely differenti want to call it a newbecausenever seen it but i did kinda remind me of the secret circle in a tiny way i can not wait for the rest of this series pick it up and give it a try you will not be sorry,142,132
8807,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,try as i might i could not like this heroine i did not respect her or like her weak personality there are many logical errors in the plot that really pulled me out i did not like how predictable and stereotypical it was either there were no surprises and no depth how sad that the good looking people are the good guys and the ugly the bad the girl was desperate to fit in with the popular people which is lame i would rank the book lower but i did finish it,90,133
8808,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i bought this for my kindle because it sounded like a good story and the cover looked interesting but the story was boooorrring and took too long for anything to develop none of the characters were very sympathetic or likable including tracy the heroine of the book all she ever did was whine and complain and the secondary characters were selfish and bitchy also i do not understand the cover because tracy never wore a ballgown in the book she only wore jeans and what is with the butterflies i do not get it maybe if i was a teenage girl i might like it but i am a grown woman and i could not get into this book,117,134
8809,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,this book was a little on the slow side for me i found myself skimming and skipping pages which is something i never try to do it took way to long for the action to pick up and i did not understand the romance at all what happened with the sexy young doctor what was the whole purpose of the hospital scene hopefully book two will be better i really hate to quit a series,74,135
8810,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i gave this book a try but i got 3/4 of the way through and just could not finish the story is incredibly slloooow and i kept falling asleep i did not care about a single character and the romance yawn the island setting was cool but i was frustrated with constant references to the sinister history without coming to the point i do not think the basic premise of the plot is bad but it needs to move a little faster,77,136
8811,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,i agree with the other reviews it was extremely slow for the first 7 chapters it did pick up a little however not enough this book dragged all the way through the characters never developed the story line is terrible the so-called romance well it is does nt exist i am terribly disappointed can i have back the time i spent reading this book so boring,64,137
8812,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,this book came up as a recommendation for me and after reading all the five star reviews and seeing the low price i thought why not i thought the story started strangely there was a whole page about the significance of the date september 23rd of all things i thought tracys back story of wanting to go to a good school was interesting and different but as soon as we got to part where she has to travel to the school alone things got sketchy the whole situation was too weird and ridiculous to believe it might be because being on a creepy island in the middle of nowhere where people rarely leave sometimes it sounded like they could not leave does not appeal to me at all but tracy seemed to eat it up despite several ominous warnings everything was just so weird i could not believe the things that tracy went along with i did not like any of the girls in the group not sure why i was supposed to and the love interest did not seem to have any redeeming qualities beyond having pretty eyes I am not sure what happened around chapter seven to make the story seem better but i never made it there it should not take that long for a story to get interesting if you do not hook me in the first three chapters we are done i guess if you do not mind a very slow story build up and weird situations then this is the story for you but if not do not waste your money there are thousands of other ya romances to read that are done better,269,138
8813,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,first off this books cover has nothing to do with the book itself this girl does not even like to dress up i understand thecorrelation but that is it on to the book the writing is a bit choppy but it is easy to ignore thankfully the editing is good what i could not ignore was the heroines ridiculousness it is like she had no will of her own and was so into herself that she did not even notice her friends were not her friends i am disappointed that she is not a stronger character also the dialogue is a bit redundant okay very redundant there are paragraphs where something is being explained then the next character explains it again theis different and for that alone gives the review a few stars i highly enjoy the ability these characters have and there has great potential here but it is not clear exactly what can be done with them taking over the world and her eyes filled with greed are not helpful if you have nohow they can be accomplished the bad guy was also a bit ridiculous I am not sure if it was supposed to be a whodunnit but there is no way to hide who he was in this writing sadly i will not be reading any sequels of this book the promise is there and i am sure the writer will do better the next book but i am already turned off to the writing and characters especially the main one,251,139
8814,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,i was really excited to dig into this book from all of the really great reviews it seemed like everyone agreed that the book really picked up after chapter 7 but once i reached it i only continued to be disappointed i had a really hard time getting into the characters in this book the romance aspect completely fell flat spoiler i honestly left the book asking myself does rob even serve a purpose the author hyped up this intense connection between rob and tracy but nothing happens it was blatantly obvious well atleast to me who the villain was in this book not to mention you do not get to know the girls that spoiler are part of the crystal seekers at all they are all just rude and i feel the dialogue runs around in circles there was no character development within this book and tracy herself was bland and whiny i think the overallplot could be really great it is very original and with the right direction could really be something compared to all the other ya books i would just like to see some more character exploring within the next book and less monotonous writing on how tracy felt about trying to get out of the situation she was in all and all i wish tracy embraced her situation more in this book and that we were able to get to know the characters instead of just seeing the glimpse as to what they could be still debating if i would read the second to try and give it another chance,264,140
8815,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,there is almost no pace in the story for the first half tracy has a strong character and the story is different from the usual ya paranormal point of view the only good things in this book it ends without resolving anything love life tracys powers origin of the crystals,51,141
8816,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,5.0,positive,i just finished reading crystal seekers and I am still thinking about the book i will admit that the first 7 chapters were pretty slow and boring for me it was not until midway into chapter 7 really sparked my interest then i could not put my kindle down i had to finish reading the story i loved how sophia sharp really developed each character i have read her dream realms trilogy and i will say I am hooked on her writing i highly recommend this book I am looking forward till her 2nd part of crystal seekers comes out hopefully soon there is a little romance in this book which i love makes me wonder what has gon na happen in the next books if you have not read her dream realms i recommend those books to read,131,142
8817,Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,i was in the middle of an awesome book when sophia sharp the author of this amazing book was looking for proofreaders to get a sneak peek of this hidden treasure i had read sophias books before so i was not surprised when this turned out to be one of the best books i ever read but it was still amazing it took a few days for me to read it but i finished it and wanted to read it all over again reading about tracy and her life on traven island was so intriguing i could not put the book down sophia unravels the secrets hidden on this island and within tracy very carefully if you look closely several chapters convey secrets thatto a shocker ending that made me go how did i not see that coming tracy finds that life is not always normal and that speaks volumes for all of us life is unpredictable and tracy does not handle it the best way but her intention comes out in the end this is a book a would totally recommend to any reader who loves paranormal if you read like me you live in paranormal books twilight dream realms and more and this book does not overdue it it is the paranormal that makes you go what but also go wow i absolutely loved this book and there really is not much more to say except read the book,235,143
8860,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this does not tell you how to pronounce the words it only shows you the picture the work in english and the work in french did not like this at all,29,0
8861,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i took french in high school too many years ago and now work in a bilingual area this book is honestly no help unless you want to learn about your animal words save your money unless you get it free,40,1

8863,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i was not impressed with this app to help learn french it was extremely basic and did not fit my needs which were to review french for my trip to france,31,3
8864,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,an okay selection of phrases but this needed to be an application not a book i did not manage to make the audio work and it was not worth the trouble to figure it out,33,4
8865,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,it is good for your children but if you want to learn or improve your french please find another books the vocabulary is too easy although i found some sentences are quite useful but still too easy vocab,36,5
8866,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,the audio which accompanies book must be purchased separately so if you are trying to learn how to speak and understand french and have never taken it before this book will not help much if you want this as a vocabulary refresher / reminder or if you only want to learn to read elementary french childrens books or maybe street signs not madame bovary or cousine bette then this book is excellent with audio it would have gotten 5,75,6
8867,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,last i saw there were no reviews on this and since i look at reviews constantly to pick things to buy i figured i could share what i know about this book it is a very simple vocabulary book so there has a word with a picture like bird and a picture of a bird and then it gives you the french word under that it gives you several sample sentences like i have a bird and then their translations no that is not an exact example i am paraphrasing if you do not know french at all not having any sort of pronunciation guide could be an issue i rather wish there was one myself i have not taken french for a long time but still seems to be a well done book for refrencing french vocabulary even if you will not really be able to pick it up and teach yourself a new language,156,7
8868,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,i downloaded this book to brush up with my french it is a two part download you download the book here and you have to go to the publishers website to download the audio i never had the chance to download the audio because they do not have the ipad as a platform they have kindle although i emailed the publisher but i never received a response about my dilemma anyway I am giving the book three stars because I am only rating one half of it update after four days since sending the publisher email they gave me instructions on how to download the audio but it was for the kindle only nothing for the ipad,114,8

8888,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i probably made a mistake i know a lot of french but as people who have studied languages in schools and universities we read a lot do a lot of grammar but do not learn enough everyday vocabulary and expressions and never or almost never develop fluency the book would be helpful to someone who is just beginning to learn french,61,28
8889,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,good to help you learn french but should get audio so you can pronounce the words and start to hear the language,22,29

8903,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,the book is locked down to a few sections the table of contents is good i do not understand why it is a truncated version,24,43
8904,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,pathetic level ok for 5 year olds nothing more,9,44
8905,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this would be useful for very very basic beginning french the problem is that while the words given are elementary the french in the example sentences is not that basic so i am not sure who could use this book,40,45
8906,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,actually i would give this a very low score i just wanted to brush up on my french for a beginner there are no pronunciation guides i do not think that anyone needs to know how to say pimple on the nose,41,46
8907,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,next to useless a very limited vocabulary building book but can be used in idle moments to fill in time for serious french language students forget it cest les crap,31,47
8908,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this small collection of words and related sentences has little to do with what you need in order to speak french,21,48
8909,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,teaches you french words but no pronunciation and the process of downloading the free learning aid did not work because i did not download on my laptop and turn it into a apple file,32,49

8914,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,good refresher but not too much on conversational french expected a little more but was a quick refresher au revoir,20,54
8915,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,should not have bought this book without the audio to go along with it i can not pronounce just from reading and could not keep focused on it enough to learn much as of yet i am sure i will order the audio before long but summer is not the time to study,50,55
8916,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this book did not really help me at all but i suppose you may need more of a background in french than i have if you already kind of know the language i think this would be a good purchase but if you are pretty clueless start with something more involved like rosetta stone or a language class,57,56
8917,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,this book is better for visual learners i liked the ways pictures are presented and examples drawn from each pictures inclusion of phonetics in french could help learners know how to pronounce the word in french,36,57

8921,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,it is okay but not enough phrases mostly animals food body parts and numbers maybe getting part 2 helps might even be 2 stars,23,61
8922,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,it is just a collection of nouns most of which are useless unless you like emus and other birds and snakes seriously the product description is hilarious when compared to the content not worth downloading for free,37,62
8923,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,i like learning french because it is fun and a good pastime the book is more helpful i you download the audio book that goes with it,26,63

8927,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i want a simple quick refresher on some basic french phrases but this book was not helpful at all the beginning starts with the names of different animals and has some complete sentences but there is no guide to pronunciation i deleted it after reading the first two chapters to free up space for something more useful,57,67

8929,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this might be a good start for someone who really wants to learn french but if you are looking for something to boost your old high school french or to give you a basic understanding with some guidance for frequently needed phrasing this is not for you you would also be left pretty much on your own in terms of figuring out correct pronunciation just glad the kindle edition was free,68,69
8930,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,but you ought to download the free audio book with it separately from innovative language site the audio only gives the word pronunciations but not the reading and other french limited but ok for free as anof some french words,42,70
8931,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,i thought that if this were an audio book this might not be half bad but then i thought how would i know how to say these words without the abbreviations,31,71
8932,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,still very informative but on limited vocab categories basic words but integrated in complex sentences good for people with existing french background,22,72

8935,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,it was too short to be worth even 99 cents but if it is free it can be helpful as it provides a few sentences after each vocabulary word sure some of the words are a bit useless but if it is free I had still recommend it,45,75
8936,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,it is a free book even although it is more like a book for children with animal photo and on but it is free so it is ok,24,76

8950,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,this is a simple okay approach to vocabulary introducing words in conceptual groupings with short phrases and translations no attempt beyond that at instruction or the facilitation of recall,29,90
8951,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,horribly misrepresented even for free there has a catch beware it is useless as any free app can do the same thing,21,91

8959,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,I shall admit that the approach they used was interesting grouping certain vocabulary words like fruits animals and more but i was hoping for something with more practical words appropriate for a tourist trying to improve on his hs french some fifty years ago for an upcoming trip to paris but this was a freebee and you get what you pay for,61,99

8962,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,nice simple book but i wish it had a word pattern beside the french word to help with the pronunciation but otherwise it is very precise and great for starters,29,102

8970,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,only buy it if you do not know a thing i bought it to see how much I had forgotten over the years and it was useful if you know even a little bit perhaps take on a more difficult read however if you are brand new to learning french this is great basic vocabulary it even puts words into expressions and sentences for you it is not at all overwhelming as sometimes language books can be bonne chance,75,110
8971,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,it was just a list of vocabulary so it was not very good for learning the french language i would not recommend it,23,111
8972,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,it works like a picture book and i really love that type of way to learn a foreign language I am not a complete beginner i studied french both in high school and also as a undergrad in college but i have forgotten much of what i have learned this little e-book is a great way to remember french but i would also suggest it for the beginner or novice or even a child,73,112
8973,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,unbeatable price zero unfortunately not particularly engaging and a bit repetitive but i suppose the latter is good for beginners,20,113

8983,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,there is no way to translate such a romance language to american it is a great attempt it seriously helps it makes me wish i had paid better attention in fench classes in high school,34,123

8987,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,this book was not exactly what i had hoped for i will look for others that provide a different format,20,127

8989,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,4.0,positive,very easy and convenient but even if you tried to slow it down it was either the same or too slow and hard to remember but french is a romantic and pretty language to speak so a defiant of 4 stars,41,129

8993,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,3.0,neutral,too short not enough words otherwise ok the photos are excellent and i liked the context for learning the words,21,133
8994,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this thing has to have the cd with it otherwise it is useless another one of those books they have to give away,22,134
8995,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this book is great only if you want to discuss bird watching animals or comment on someone has beard it contains and collection of random phrases and words not even the alphabet it also does not contain a pronunciation key,38,135
8996,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,this is so useless it is not work the space it takes on a device i could not even use the audio portion for accent practice because the download on the link they provided failed on both my kindle and my laptop for someone who has never learned any french at all this might be a charming lesson in a limited number of vocabulary words that you will probably never use,69,136
8997,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,this is the type of thing i read on the train trying to slowly build my vocabulary of french words good for the beginner but not a comprehensive tool for learning a language,33,137
8998,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,the book is okay you can learn lots of phrases like the adolecent grows facial hair and anything you need to say about sheep not so many useful phrases,29,138

9001,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,very easy to understand and to learn french you have very good vocabulary at the end of each chapter plus many examples and pictures,24,141
9002,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,i bought this for my son because he is taking french this year in high school for him it was like reading an instruction manual from another planet i tried to go through it with him and to be honest i had about as much trouble as he did you really need to already have a feel for the language and pronunciation to get anything out of this book we also hated the layout but that is just a personal issue,80,142
9003,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,1.0,negative,i have a very good french vocabulary but my grammar is a bit rusty after looking at about 20 pages i realized some of the translations are wrong i checked with my husband who grew up speaking french and he agreed with me that this is a very poor book,50,143
9004,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,the book is very limited in scope it covers a small vocabulary of words like fruits and vegetables and numbers one through ten it includes short phrases or sentences using the featured words it was not comprehensive enough to be of much help but for a free download to kindle it is hard to complain,54,144
9005,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,5.0,positive,loved this book it is a great learning tool not only does it give you the words meaning it also puts it in a sentence which is great highly recommend this,31,145

9007,Kindle_Store,B006OIUC0U,2.0,negative,the concept was good however the audio would not download to listen along i deleted the book after 3 tries,20,147
9376,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i noticed the reviews are very low but i would not rank it as a 1 what i saw was a lot of mentioning how it rushes through everything lack of development missing more of the story but the story was a short story therefore you can only write so much in that length of the book i wonder if the people marking it poorly noticed how many pages it was therefore expecting more for the length of the story there was enough development to let you know who each person it is a quick read if you have little time i do think you will enjoy it more than the low marks given,111,0
9377,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,shallow plot lousy dialogue and because the story is too short everything was been hush honestly it is not worth the time,20,1
9378,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,no story development and no point in reading story it was too short to go anywhere nor could reader connect to characters,22,2
9379,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,what others have said about it being a fast read is true short story is more like it and i thought then ending was abrupt should have included an epilogue,30,3
9380,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this short story is centered on hutch and trina when trina is visiting their old hometown for a few days turns out that they both have had a secret crush on each other for awhile but could never act on their feelings of lust because of trinas overprotective older brother nash and hutchs best friend they have no such inhibitions this time as nash is not around this story moves very quickly in my opinion it is just okay if you have a few minutes to spare read the book as a nice escape from reality,96,4
9381,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,already home was just okay to be honest thebehind the story line was a fairly good one but it just moved way to fast and felt incomplete one minute they are catching up the next they are having sex and then the next they are going to get together anytime they can find time and that is it end of story but it was free and tolerable so 3 stars,71,5
9382,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,temporarily home in wyoming for different reasons videographer hutch meets horse trainer trina and things heat up with these two childhood friends short sweet and tightly written already home is a fast read that you can actually finish it during your lunch and although this is classified as blaze the sex scenes are tame hence if someone is reading it behind you it is okay,65,6
9383,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,enjoyed the book fast easy pace recommend this book characters interesting and easy to become friends with and to bond with thank you,22,7

9387,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,all the chance books are great the romance is wonderful the stories are always interesting and the characters are are interesting,21,11

9389,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,biggest problem with this book is what most authors are doing now what happened to a book beginning and ending in the same book any other related books were from other characters stories this is getting ridiculous,36,13
9390,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,enjoyable reading I am sucker for happy ending love romance stories,10,14
9391,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed it but it was too short,8,15
9392,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,this book written by vicki lewis thompson was very interesting i am sure you would enjoy it as much as i did i would recommend reading it,27,16

9395,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,this is a really cute and fun read it is fairly short i was actually able to complete it in under an hour but i still enjoyed it immensely i loved the feel of the small town and the cute homey names of the stores such as the likity split and the spirits and spurs it reminded me quite a bit of my teenage years that i spent in a small town i loved the addition of a teenage crush coming to fruition later in life i had a similar conversation as a young adult with my teenage crush and although it did not come to such a happy ending as this one i found this story extremely nostalgic i loved the added worry about parents hearing them in the bedroom it added some teenage angst that made the book all that much more nostalgic to me not only was this book sweet it also had it is moments of fantastic humour such as the parents downstairs doing basically the same thing as their children i found the morning after exchange hilarious and was embarrassed for the couple my only complaint about this book is that since it is so short the ending does not have as much resolution as I had like i really wish the author had gone further into the story to give this couple the hea that they deserved definitely a cute quick read for a dull night,236,19
9396,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,enjoyed the story line however do not like abrupt endings so will try another of this authors books to see if it is just her stylr before i make a final decision on putting her in my authors to folloehd,40,20

9399,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,i have read a couple of the sons of chance books by vicki lewis thompson so i knew of the town and some of the people this was a novella about katrina and hutch friend of jack and josie this was a cute story of 2 people who liked each other while in school but did not act on it due to katrina being 2 years younger and was hutchs best friend nashs sister so off limits they are both grown up and the time seems to be right to act on their attraction it was a good romantic book with a cute twist worth the 1read,108,23
9400,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this was a cute short story it was a jump in there quick to the point short story that had room to be so much more if this was rewrote as a stand alone novel i think it would be really great,42,24
9401,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,could have used a little more depth not the greatest book i have read but it is also not the worse,21,25
9402,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,I have been reading all of the sons of chance series and was very disappointed in this one the story was too short i keep thinking i had accidently skipped a few chapters where has the rest of the story,38,26

9405,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,this is a short story and easy to read very fast and you know how it will end before you are ever through half of the book just a little love story,32,29
9406,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i liked how the story started out i liked the characters and their histories i did not however care too much for the way the story ended rather abruptly,29,30
9407,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,I am not even sure what this was it is not a short story and it is not a chapter I am a huge fan of vicki lewis thompson however this was a mistake,30,31
9408,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i was eager to read this story as part of the series it could be read as a stand alone although regular characters are mentioned unfortunately once it got past the introduction it felt rushed and the relationship forced along too quickly trina and hutch grew up together and had secret teen crushes for each other but now years later meeting up again unexpectedly they wish to pursue this they sneak around and get a big surprise the morning after which forces them to decide to cool their affair then things just get awkward until they come up with a temporary solution maybe if this had been stretched out into a longer page count i might have been able to connect with the story or characters but as it was it was just okay for me,136,32
9409,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,they say for no one but apparently it does for langford and trina everyone wonders what would happen if they ran into old flames or someone they wanted to be a flame great read with lots of opportunities for the happily ever after that i love so much,46,33
9410,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,downloaded easy and does not glitch my wife said it was an ok read but a bit long winded and not one of the best she has read,27,34
9411,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i have not read this yet so i can not really rate it i hope to read it soon although,20,35
9412,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,this book is an amazing read i have it on many platforms to be able to read where ever i am,21,36
9413,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,fast enjoyable read i liked both of the characters neither trina nor hutch are broken running from something or in need of saving on the contrary they are grounded adults who understand themselves and what they want out of life living out a fantasy from their teenage years does not change them the goals they have set for themselves or the passion they have for their careers i found that remarkably refreshing the ending therefore seemed realistic and hopeful it tied up nicely but remained true to the characters i also loved the supporting characters and the subplot which was well developed for such a short story I had like to read more in this series and i really want to learn more about robert and lucy,124,37
9414,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,another in the sons of chance series always a good read again for ms thompson love the series but they stand well on their own great story yummy guys,29,38

9416,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,but please be married when you read this book because really it can get your juices going so make sure you have a husband / wife / something,24,40
9417,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,this story was too short and there was no character development and no time to connect with the characters in this story it did not really have an ending it just kind of ended and it leaves you wanting to know what happened to the rest of the story so glad it was free,53,41
9418,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,this is the first book i read by vicki lewis thompson this was way too short i think it could been a better story if it was longer,28,42
9419,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i read through this short romance story fairly quickly hutch is a videographer who has returned to his hometown to help his widowed father run the store while home hutch runs into trina who has come back home for a few days they are both attracted to each other and discover that they both had feelings for each other as teenagers but never acted on those feelings now they have to find a way to make a relationship work as each of them wants to keep their careers where they travel a lot but they can not carry on an affair without some type of commitment as their families would be upset overall i liked the story and characters i liked the surprise situation with the parents and i would probably read more to see how this relationship develops a quick read but it just lacked a little something not sure what there is a love scene but it is not as graphic as some others at the time i downloaded this ebook to my kindle it was being offered in the kindle store for free which in no way affected my review,191,43
9420,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,it was a good short story would rather have a longer story would read another like it can not wait for more bye,20,44

9422,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this is not a long book but it does cover everything that other romance stories have in less time trina and hutch face a challenge of having a romance relationship while their window parents are together they end up being under the same house doing the same thing without knowing for sure what is going on i do think love has to be released to know if it is true or just a thing that will blow over i enjoy this book because it was short simple and went straight to the point,93,46
9423,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,i went into reading already home sons of chance by vicki lewis thompson knowing it was a novella for one reason or another i am still surprised to find out some of these are not long i should be used to it by now anyways this one is a very quick contemporary read hutch is at home taking care of his father and his fathers store after the death of his mother and trina is home visiting her mother for the weekend as the story tells it hutch and trina both have secretly liked each other since they were teenagers but out of respect for trinas brother they never dated or confessed their feelings for one another they spend the weekend working out the state of their relationship and certain body parts in the process read the rest of this review at [ ] [ ] [ ] twitter reviewingromanc,147,47
9424,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,totally enjoyed would like to read more about the sons of chance it grabbed me from the very beginning i love a good love story who does not love a cowboy,30,48
9425,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,i do not even know how to start rating this book it is so not what i expected from vicki lewis i was confused if their parents are getting married would that make them brother and sister and when they find out why not end the relationship instead of continuing something that is already doom i did not enjoy this book i almost did not finish it ven although it is a short story was very disappointed,71,49
9426,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,it was really short so it definitely cut to the chase but it was kinda of cheesy and awkward it did not seem necessary to the series and i just did not connect with this one at all i did however like the preview of the next sons of chance installment that was the best part,54,50
9427,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,i love this author but was not as impressed with this story as i have been with others of hers it a quick read thou,25,51
9428,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,i got this for free and it only took me about 40 minutes to read i liked it it was well written and focused on these two characters that always liked each other but could not be together so when they finally can it is great i knew it was short and i got it for free so i have no complaints i like this authors writing style I had be unhappy if I had paid anything other than 99 cents for it because of the short length but definetly worth reading,88,52
9429,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,so i read the reviews a little too late otherwise i would not have purchased this book the story is short knew that ahead of time however it is just a little too short and too the point more like a quick description not a developed story i could tell that thecharacters hutch and trina are obviously in to each other and make it pretty clear to each other right away the book left me feeling like i had experienced a quick one night stand instead of a whole relationship i am not completely disappointed in the purchase but am however glad it was a free offering i would have been quite angered if i had purchased it then found out how short and simple it was,129,53
9430,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,I shall start by saying that I am a fan of novellas short sweet and to-the-point books are perfect for my hectic schedule already home was a great novella other reviewers commented on the abruptness of the book but i think it was great when you consider the length of the book looking forward to reading some of her full-length novels because her writing style was easy to read and enjoyable if the kids are down for a nap or you have an hour lunch break read this it is a cute storyline about going home again and rekindling a romance with that one guy who you crushed on all throughout high school but never dated i think many readers can relate to that and will enjoy the exchange between the main characters,130,54
9431,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i really felt like these characters the male hero is 30 at least the female just two years younger were mentally about 16 the whole way through the book it does not help that the cowboy keeps remembering a time when he saw the woman girl in a bikini at the age of 15 the two have come back to wyoming for different reasons bump into each other realise they each had a crush on the other one as teenagers and sneak back to his fathers house to have sex his father and her mother are also having sex and are planning on getting married the immature dialogue the sneaking around behind their parents back the concern about the heroines older brother the heros best friend finding out and getting angry all too young for me the ending is more a hfn than hea which is fine with me i do not require hea in romances at all but it still felt rushed despite all this i probably would give one of the authors longer works a go but this one did not work for me too short and with absolutely no story,189,55
9432,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,i was disappointed with this novella there was very little character development the plot had no real storyline and everything seemed to happen way to fast there was no build up to events also the ending was bad really really bad,41,56
9433,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,i have never been so disappointed in a book by this author before until now it was way to short i was just getting into the book and then it was over like i said above it is a good thing it was free or i would have been really upset if i were you i would skip this one it is not worth the time it takes to download it,69,57

9435,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,very short read i loved the premise it is one of my favorite storylines falling in love with the big brothers best friend but i wanted a real ending and did not get it here that is the only downfall no real hea,41,59
9436,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,this was ok for a short story the only problem is that i did not realize that was what this was also seems like it would be better if you were reading the series and knew the characters and their storylines,40,60
9437,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,this was a disappointing read the hero and heroine were likable but a bit cardboard even the sex scene lacked excitement and there was no romance to it at all the ending was very abrupt,35,61
9438,Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,after reading the reviews on this short story i had to read it because of all the complaints about it being rushed and more of course it was rushed it is a short story people start checking the page count then you will know what you are getting already home was a good read short and sweet a tale about two people hutch and trina who have been hot for each other for some time and when they get a chance to reunite the sparks fly the characters are likable and i could not wait to see how it was going to end i was not disappointed one star no way I have read full-length books that were not as good as this short story it was well-written with proper grammar and i did not find one typo give the author a break it was a short story for petes sake entertaining four stars,144,62
9593,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,4.0,positive,not perfect but pretty darn good i definitely think this book is helpful and useful i recommend it being self-sufficient is important these days and books like this can sure help in the right direction,35,0

9596,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,this is a book on gardening it talks about testing the soil and more in integrated pest management it defines the three steps but does not tell how to accomplish the third except that some garden ears pick the insects off of the plants it is also written in a different country and alludes to laws not existing here the table of contents does not link to the toc but rather to the first chapter why two stars because it actually provided a little bit of practical information it just had to be dug out i picked this up when it was free and am glad i did not pay for it,110,3
9597,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,1.0,negative,the book description itself is confusing and makes little sense i would have no reason at all to buy a book when the description of it is poorly written outdated the millenium bug really and confusing,36,4

9602,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,you may be like myself and enjoy being as self sufficient as possible this book is a super guide to doing just that you know all those questions you should have asked great grandma and great grandpa the answers to those are in this book you can live through a great deal of economic collapse with a book like this much of the information in this book is from knowledge of people who has only economy was what they could sustain on their own i would not be afraid to sell this one door to door great book,97,9
9603,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,it is a good resource book to have access to through a kindle or ipad while learning about self sufficiency the books can become cumbersome and take up a lot of space,31,10
9604,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,the information was too basic there was not enough info in the book to make it worth my time not at all interesting at all,25,11
9605,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,3.0,neutral,this was a great beginning resource for the survivalist however it was short on detail and just barely scraped the surface it left me wanting more,26,12
9606,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,I have been gardening all my life and there was very little here that my father had not taught me by the age of 10 however if you have never been around growing vegetables this could be a good primer there are some distracting grammar and organizational problems but they should not prevent the books use consider other more detailed books if you are not just starting out note also that this author is from the uk and includes some information about planning permission historic buildings and the like that will not apply to readers in the us,96,13
9607,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,4.0,positive,it is a reminder of the way i grew up and i am starting to believe that we need to return to this to save our planet and our health,30,14
9608,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,4.0,positive,i wanted more out of this book and i plan to find it but this was absolutely amazing just to read i did learn alot,24,15
9609,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,5.0,positive,here i found a lot of info about harvesting which is one my hobbies but these like a starting guide because there is more about it is not only about a couple of fruits and vegetables,35,16
9610,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,1.0,negative,this is not a good book it is not even really a bad book either it appears to be some random information on gardening from a number of different sources all crammed together some appear to be from the uk there are references to truffles and selling them for thousands of pounds and some appear to be from the us there has information on the usda growing zones and there has nothing connecting it all it is just sort of tossed together there has nothing even homesteading specific in here just random gardening and mushrooms information that looks like it is been garbled through an online translator nothing about animals nothing about wisely using space or crop rotation nothing that would actually be helpful for a backyard homesteader the formatting is terrible as well with font sizes changing at random it really looks to me as although someone whose first language is not english tried to compile some information without entirely understanding it and added no content of their own for example heres the first sentence of chapter 4 an organic topping that is utilized in the process of retaining moisture in garden soil is garden mulch which is organic it is a bizarre word salad that does not really tell anyone much useful if you were unfamiliar with mulch would that help you understand it any better anyone who a can read english and b read this book would recognize how useless it is please save your money there is nothing in here that you could not find on the internet and in plain language as well,256,17
9611,Kindle_Store,B009IXETAM,2.0,negative,i take no pleasure in giving a bad review but i would encourage the author to consider pulling this book off the market and re-releasing it later with some necessary changes 1 change the title homesteading is a bell jar term that covers many different aspects of the activity and this short book only discusses the vegetable garden 2 although I am certain the author has been successful in his own vegetable garden the overview does not cover a lot of ground for it is price there is no mention of mushroom mulch square-foot gardening raised bed gardening and other aspects of raising ones own food that are considered standard for those forced to utilize a minimum space on a budget 3 where did the chapter on mushrooms come from and although the title mentions wild edible plants it only mentions mushrooms 4 it would help to have the book reviewed by others to deal with typos and stilted sentences nonetheless there are some gems in the book such as putting plants with specific water requirements together the minimum amount of sunlight certain crops need and although never worded in this manner that the gardener raises dirt which in turn raises the vegetables,201,18
10551,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,just when we need him most here comes gore vidal with a slim but deep look at our nations beginning vidals elegant waspish wit makes this book along with everything else he writes a delight but the true value of this work lies in it is content vidal makes it clear in his afterword that the book was inspired by a brief conversation he had with john f kennedy in november 1961 kennedy wondered why we had no great men of the caliber of the founding fathers in his own time how depressed he would have been had he lived forty more years and witnessed our present crop of leaders vidal does not really give us a clear answer to kennedys question but he does manage in less than 200 pages to remind us of both the founders human frailties and their greatness with vidal washington adams jefferson franklin and many others do not come out as icons but neither are they the villains some would make them one finishes this book in an hour or so aware that the men who created our nation were human after all but intelligent and dedicated men who compare rather well with their successors in 2003,200,0
10552,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,you would think that an historian especially a distinguished one would know better than to constantly diverge into politics when writing good history if you like gores political views you will like this book otherwise you will not i do not mind his political writing when it is sold as that but this was supposed to be history,54,1
10553,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,i was disappointed in this book it did not have the clarity and focus of other gore vidal histories i have read i found it rambled a lot was confusing and appeared disorganized there was no clear timeline,38,2
10554,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i enjoy reading books about the founding of america i thought that was what this book would be however he makes the common fatal flaw of interpreting historical figures using modern standards also he has the annoying habit of jabbing at george w bush throughout the book i was not the biggest fan of gwb but this had no place in a book of this topic i gave the book to goodwill,71,3
10555,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,short on new facts not cohesive not an interesting or captivating read filled with the authors unsupported comparisons to present day events i listened to it 3 times consecutively and feel the same not nearly as good as for instance john adams by david mccullough,45,4
10556,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,the following comments are for the unabridged audio book version of inventing a nation of particular interest is a fascinating afterword spoken by author gore vidal in this relatively short book i noted that the page count of the print version is 198 gore vidal attempts to place his literary arms around the efforts of those three principal actors in our early national drama washington adams and jefferson this is by all accounts a book of non-fiction but i find his style very similar to his fictional prose extremely fascinating and sometimes very frustrating that comment is based upon my limited reading of his historical fiction burr 1876 and lincoln trust vidal to highlight some the historical oddities that can challenge our uninformed assumptions washington gallantly waiver his salary as commander of the continental army but after the war submitted his bill for personal expenses of 100000 our bloody enemies the mercenary hessians married local girls western pa and delaware hence the many german family names found in those areas vidal broaches the rumor the hamilton was washingtons illegitimate son after all gw did visit the bahamas once the anti-catholic pope-hating yankee protestants thought an invasion of canada in 1776 let by the redoubtable benedict arnold would be a resounding success after all would not the popish frenchmen rally around the new englanders against the british oppressors vidal has a keen facility for discerning the eccentricity of human nature his insightful observations breath life into the founding fathers a fascinating read or listen recommended,255,5
10557,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,gore vidals historical novels give me enormous pleasure and so i was looking forward to this book and to learning more about a very important period in the nations history it certainly debunks the conventional myth especially cherished in the state where i live of great statesmen producing a divinely-inspired constitution which has never been bettered and probably never can be i am not a good enough historian to judge the accuracy of vidals account of the infighting and self-interest that lay behind the facade but it is a plausible and very entertaining tale which provides an incentive to explore the topic further however there are two defects which spoiled the book for me one is minor my hardcover copy suffered from bad editing or proof-reading or both and contained too many immensely long sentences which seemed to have lost their verbs or perhaps even a complete line and punctuation so i was frequently re-reading to try to extract the meaning the other to my mind is fatal the incessant acerbic attacks on present day that is 2003 politicians especially the bush administration and in some cases on dubya himself of course future historians will puzzle over the attacks on constitutional rights that followed 9/11 and why the public tolerated them but the causes and appropriate responses to real or perceived terrorism are complicated and contentious this is an issue that needs greater perspective and much deeper analysis the snide comments in this book are more of a superficial and irrelevant distraction than a serious contribution the final three pages recounting a conversation with jfk 40 years ago seem purely snobbish name-dropping although they also give vidal space to observe that thinking is something no longer done in public life sadly this says more about vidals arrogance than anything else,299,6
10558,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,this book is a sorry attempt to trash the founding fathers of the united states of america it is not worth the time of reading it or the money spent to buy it,33,7
10559,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,this work was my introduction to vidal and frankly i was not impressed while somewhat well researched much of it is vidals personal opinion and sounds oddly like a more hardcore republican party revisionist take on the constitution and the founding fathers than one might imagine from someone allied with the democrats his arrogance on the subject makes it almost laughable vidals writing style is choppy and disjointed in places the whole work is entirely unsatisfying,76,8
10560,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,inventing a nation by gore vidal is a concise and clear analysis of the development of the united states of america and how the decisions made in the late 18th century impact government today gore vidal cuts to the chase he destroys the myth of american democracy by revealing the constructions of the constitution the formation of the three branches of government and the development of the electoral college at times vidal can be didactic and not everyone will agree with his suppositions i checked this book out from the library on cd then read the librarys print addition now I am purchasing a copy for my mother to read and to pass on to others i highly recommend this book,120,9
10561,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,i was never enthralled by this book not a history buff i was not thrilled to learn of important concepts with little flippant comments to entertain rather than educate with elaboration he has some flair for the dramatic interactions whether exaggerated or not among characters the three main hamilton marshall franklinhowever they are not developed or enriched with further explanation i giving him two stars grant him the benefit of the doubt that he had to invent the nation with only 177 pages but this is far too limited he emphasizes discord and elements of struggle for one principle and it is inventor over another rather than collaboration among fellow patriots clearly it is important to see the contrast of one party and patriot against the other but it is overemphasized or just not fully explained to give any nuance he is strictly secular in the invention of the nation which for me limits it further altogether if you have started reading it by all means finish it if not skip it I have heard his other works have more merit however,182,10
10562,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i admit that i have not finished the book yet and i may not i picked this up from the library expecting a book about the founding of the united states with respect to our first three presidents while that may be in the book the book is primarily an anti-bush diatribe i am not one to defend president bush but i can not stand intellectual dishonesty in the book vidal states that invading canada in response to 9/11 made as much sense as invading afghanistan while the issue of invading iraq is and continues to be a controversial one there has been very little opposition to our invasion of afghanistan our current president obama has stated many times that our fight against terror was in afghanistan and not iraq for vidal to state that afghanistan had as much to do with 9/11 as canada comes across to me as intellectually dishonest his hatred of president bush has made the book almost completely unreadable in my opinion,166,11
10563,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i love reading about the founders and i have been studying early american history for several years trying to make out the character of jefferson in particular this book was not a big help in that regard it merely reinforced the popular portrayal of jefferson as a man who used wishful thinking in place of reason jeffersons philosopher king act was a front for a self-delusional aristocrat as gore vidal makes clear it is too bad i was hoping for a better glimpse of jefferson and what made him great this book is stale and tired in depth it is not much more than 1776 the musical vidal has not kept up with research on the founders and his characters are more like caricatures vidal is oblique and wordy making me wonder what does he think he is talking about he seems to obscure his meaning deliberately dropping hints and insider jargon making vague generalizations perhaps if his readers realized what he was trying to say they would accurately conclude how poorly-formed his ideas are in the end you sincerely hope that this was not the best vidal could do you hope this was an ignorant and indolent slurring of history put forward mainly as a way to get the publishers advance on the book rather than the best product of his highest ideals i shudder to think that one of the icons of modern american literature might produce such rubbish if he were working in earnest,248,12
10564,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,a snippy opinionated disorganized presentation that causes one to question the credibility of the information after just a few chapters,20,13
10565,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,i had never read a gore vidal book before i was looking forward to it and even enjoyed the first twenty pages or so then vidal starts manipulating history i had nowhy he was distorting things until he went off on his tirade about corruption and the 2000 election that has no place in this book i actually agreed with most of vidals points about corruption in current government but there is no excuse for his manipulation of facts he guesses at motives or makes them smoothly fit into his ideals the more i read the more insane vidal became making absolutely stupid conjectures about the founders actions and how they would look shamefully upon this america when they lived in an america where tarring and feathering was common there are much more accurate books on the foundation of the country and much better books about the current political climate vidals corruption of history is despicable,158,14
10566,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,can i get my money back please this book was a joke and waste of my time,17,15
10567,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,looking at the front cover of this book i had big hopes for a such a work written by historian legend gore vidal but honestly I am horribly disappointed now sitting at the other end of the cover yes vidal does cover his historical data well and even having read other works recently about the same era i did learn new things however vidal also uses this text as a forum to inject some of his own political views through partisan commentary on current events i understand our past colors our future and vice versa but i wanted a book that covered the scope of history not one that told me how we were all modern day heathens in the throes of sending our forefathers turning in their graves at the disgrace we have become i do not agree with all of mr vidals current day political positions and having to be beat over the head with how horrid we have become and the despotism of any one not in line with his personal political views got tiring if you rip out the rhetoric and personal observations more befitting a political commentary the history lesson in and of itself is a worthy read on it is own merit if you can not over look that aspect although find yourself a different book on our founding fathers,220,16
10568,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i thought i loved history but maybe because i did not graduate from harvard i was not able to find any excitement in vidals history lesson it felt more like a lecture than anything engaging if only dave berry can collaborate with vidal then we may have something,46,17
10569,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,this is the first book i have read by gore vidal this is probably not his best work but you can see his political leaning in his writing in his view our present system is a tyranny especially with the 2000 election in mind in this book he takes a negative view of our founding fathers perhaps other authors have made these men mythical but vidal returns them to the human species they were men who made mistakes none of them were perfect however i think vidal is overly negative in his viewpoint of these men they founded a new nation with great principles the author jumps around quite a bit in this history he also has some new history with the revelation of hamilton as a british spy i think the author came to that out of his own conclusions this was a uneven read and some of the language was difficult to understand maybe someday i will appreciate his writings if i adapt his poltical philosophy,168,18
10570,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,arch-iconoclast gore vidal who made his name as a novelist tackles non-fiction here and does a fine job of it this short and straight-to-the-point book hits us history head-on and peels back the dust and whitewash to show americas authentic greatest generation those who fought the revolution and then created the nation in the 1780s as it surely was walking a fine line between respectful praise and candid revelation vidal introduces washington adams jefferson hamilton and others as no history professor probably ever has this book is not a slam biography of anyone nor is it one of those tedious lambasting of our national institutions that too often masquerade as warts and all history no vidal shines here in this story of the events behind the time-worn legends in early us history i personally found much to like in this book and discovered a last gem hidden in it is closing pages as vidal describes a moment of relaxed conversation with his friend and distant relation by marriage president john f kennedy on that day shortly before the presidents brutal murder kennedy turned to vidal and asked how it was that so many great men all lived at once in the generation that formed our nation vidals one-word answer was unique and while as he freely confesses not comprehensive it was good and it is left me pondering it on more than one occasion since i read it i will not say here what that answer was but you will find it in the last chapter of inventing a nation and it is worth seeking out,261,19
10571,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,listen i like gore vidals work i do and he is probably right about a lot of things although i seriously doubt his frequent inuendo that hamilton might have been washingtons illegitimate son however i can not help feeling like his attitude came through so much that it was distracting me from what he was saying i listened to this book unabridged on audio book perhaps it was that gore was reading it himself and i got a real sense of how he felt about things rather than the history he was trying to convey i do not know but to vidal everyone was and is of sinister or selfish intent except his friends the kennedys and ben franklin that is just the feeling i got the audio book is worth the price of admission if for no other reason than to hear vidals recount of a conversation with jfk at the end of the recording seriously that part I shall give five stars,159,20
10572,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,inventing a nation is gore vidals witty and irreverent look at the three main characters george washington john adams and thomas jefferson who together and in competition invented the united states reporting the contributions strengths and faults of each vidal carries the early years of our country from the revolution through the louisiana purchase and on to the end of the founders era with the death of adams and jefferson on july 4 1826 besides the three main characters the reader also gains insights into the roles of lesser players such as alexander hamilton john jay aaron burr and john marshall particularly as they shared scenes on the world stage with the main characters i found this book to be both entertaining and irritating vidals unusual ability to turn a phrase keeps this book moving along at times vidal suddenly shifts from events early in our history to current political topics vidal has a way of presenting his impression of current issues as universally accepted fact an example of this is hisfrom a discussion of the alien and sedition acts of the adams administration to contemporary anti-terrorist laws which vidal sees as similar infringements on civil rights this i find irritating i did gain some insights into new ways of viewing individuals and developments in this portion of our history although i can say that i found other books to be more informative because the new material was relatively sparse and the cheap shots at modern policies so irritating i seriously considered giving up on this book before completion something i almost never do on the balance i am glad that i stuck with it but knowing what i know now i am not sure that i would start it,292,21
10573,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,this is the first book l have read about some of the major founders of the american republic and it will not be the last it has whetted my appetite to dig deeper and seek out some history books worth reading to tell me more at times l thought l was reading a series of articles from a psychology today magazine as the author delivered his judgments on everyone and everything in this period of american history but he did it with such wit and perception that l was both intrigued and stimulated by this book as an outsider looking in this book brought washington jefferson adams and more to life and l was able to form pictures of them in my mind as their lives decisions and relationships are described in this book it is amazing that men with such diverse interests backgrounds and ideas could forge the beginnings of a republic and achieve a unity and common destiny that has endured to this day this book is a warts and all presentation of this time in history and it is players however it is a good start for an introduction to the republics founders and to gain some insight overall it is more reflections and comments from the author than history so one needs to read wider and deeper the foundation of the american republic has so intrigued me i went out and bought american sphinx and founding brothers by joseph ellis adams by david mccullough and crucible of war by fred anderson i am sure this will be the start of a wonderful experience,265,22
10574,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,this sub-200 page book imagines the passions of and conflicts between the brilliant but flawed founding fathers mostly george washington john adams thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton vidal covers the forming of the constitution inaugral presidential terms of george washington and the subsequent battle for succession between the federalist adams hamilton john marshall and republican jefferson james madison factions hamiltons story is perhaps the most colorful vidal insinuates that he is washingtons illegitimate son and accuses him of subterfuging john jays postwar treaty with the british repeatedly labeling him agent number seven and sabatoging adams political career the book also explains several important events of the early republic like the alien and sedition acts and marbury v madison vidal includes quotes from vintage letters and other sources but also peppers the text with critical screeds against the current administration and it is policies which may distract or annoy some readers a passage from senator maclays diary describing thomas jefferson in 1790 also fits vidals book he spoke almost without ceasing but even his discourse partook of his personal demeanor it was loose and rambling and yet he scattered information wherever he went and some even brilliant sentiments sparkled from him this was my first full gore vidal book and it interested me in reading another recommended for those planning to visit the historic sites in philadelphia,226,23
10575,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i borrowed the audio book set of this book not knowing anything about it is author or his political views hoping to get a greater insight into the minds of the founding fathers unfortunately what i found to be the most prominent subject matter of this work was the anti-bush / republican propaganda now i do take exception with many of the policies and stances of the current united states presidency however if i wanted to research the effecacious practices of the current presidency i would have rather borrowed from my library a politically motivated work i for one find no place for such subjectiveness in a work on what is supposedly historical truth i prefer my history books to simply contain history not political commentary,122,24
10576,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,gore vidal whose radical political views are well known attempts to tell the genesis of this republic he focusses on the first three presidents washington adams and jefferson he however gives supporting roles to hamilton madison and monroe vidal does not move chronologically instead he jumps through events granting him freedom to pursue his prose style he covers all the major incidents in the life of the young nation filled with lots of history and biographies enlivened with acerbic commentary one learns from this book in inventing a nation vidal challenges us to confront some of the unpleasant parts of our past he infers rightly that the founding fathers after the revolution became the very evil they were fighting against however he concludes wrongly that this resulted in a contradiction i beg to differ the nation magazine which i believe prides itself on supporting freedom of speech in a recent edition chastised fastfood companies for dishonest advertising to them it is no contradiction i do not fault them neither do i fault the founders there are other remarks i oppose in this book like in page 136 he claims that the electoral college thwarts the majority rule and is therefore undemocratic this is true yet it is not right because it is possible for the majority not to represent the nation i would rather prefer the electoral college than tocquevilles tyranny of the majority what must be appreciated is that the experiment the founders indulged in was debated on intellectual even ideological grounds inventing a nation exposes the depth of banality in politics today regardless of it is sweeping generalizations it succeeds because it forces the reader think anything less the author should have saved the trees,286,25
10577,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,gore vidal does an excellent job of bringing some of the key founding fathers to life in this book laying bare their ambitions their foibles but also their genius an extremely worthwhile book that will leave you excited to read more about these great men,45,26
10578,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,I have never gotten around to reading any of gore vidals novels but his non-fiction and history are dynamite this recent offering is a colorful and human rendition of our countrys formative years the interplay between the giant figures of our nations birth washington hamilton adams jefferson franklin marshall and others is fascinating and illuminative of our contemporary struggles and rather than come down decisively on one side or the other federalists against republicans vidal is careful to lay out the nuances of each position although hamilton does come off as a main villain in many ways perhaps most intriguing is the dynamic of jeffersons trust of popular wisdom he expected the american constitution to be torn down and rebuilt quite often as scientific discoveries added to the great body of public knowledge after all who wants to be in thrall to a beclouded past franklin also expressed the view that if unchanged the political arrangements of the united states would result in a course cruel and unjust society as recent times demonstrate theological devotion to a piece of parchment scrawled by a hoary generation can result in social and political ridiculousness we perhaps need more jeffersonians and franklinites today who are willing to jettison cheap patriotic fealty to the founding fathers in favor of a renewed trust in popular power and wisdom we clearly could use a new constitution updated for the concerns of today the present version was conceived as a protector of privilege and it functions the same today,251,27
10579,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,gore vidals witty snide snobby sarcastic style of writing is very entertaining and even his critics have to admit he knows his history in this short quickly read book he demonstrates beyond doubt that our nation was founded not by saints but by aarray of men with mutiple interests visions egos and agendas the miracle is that a flexible system of government was forged from this complex interplay of lofty enlightement philosophy with base ego centered self interests vidal brings historic characters to life with tiny details for example abigail adams becomes disqusted when benjamin franklins mistress feeds her lap dog from the dinner table while washington is urging that the flimsy articles of confederation be replaced with a constitution he and his mother have a falling out the book is full of these personal touches that bring the historic characters alive in the mind of the reader the team work of these early founders despite their disagreements was fantastic adams charmed the dutch while jefferson and franklin charmed the french the genius of hamilton and madison is balanced with the exceptional political skills of washington i am always amazed when conservatives attack gore vidal since he is an advocate of maximum liberty of the individual and he will viciously criticise fdr with the same venom he would use against george w bush the reader is left with a feeling of wonder and amazement that our principals of government have survived despite the folly of many a generation of politicians vidal would have us recognize that we must remain vigilant and skeptical regarding our nations leadership and direction,270,28
10580,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,i enjoyed vidals writing other people have complained that it felt jumpy and at times he didfrom one time period to another without an explanation it was not until i reached the last few pages that i figured out why he was writing this book at all i kept waiting for some mass summarization of what he was trying to convey with all of these anecdotes it finally came in the last chapter he has trying to delve into what made these people such great men but he does not do it with the usual swift stroke that many authors take when they are trying to glorify historic figures instead he shows that these people were flawed and had their own personalities and agendas and egos but they did some great things and he conveys that through a series of anecdotes overall i enjoyed the book it did not feel like any type of propoganda just a patchwork of stories it gave me insights into those characters of the early history of the republic i would recommend it to anybody who would like a conveniently sized easy-to-read book about the characters in american history,191,29
10581,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,i concede that history is written with some bias as to the opinion of the author but historians are or should be purveyors of those opinions not the manufacturers of them historians are not writing history they are in a manner of speaking collecting and reporting on history as it was written i would not recommend this book as a basis for understanding this period of time try benson bobricks angel in the whirlwind or mcculloughs john adams this book is history according to mr vidal his references to modern day events and persons are more an indication of his political leanings than his connection of current events with events of the past you can not understand the present by making moral judgements on historical individuals since they did not have benefit of your understanding of the past conversely they had no understanding of what was to come history is becoming a victim of politics when it should be an accounting of the past skip-it,167,30
10582,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,in this poor excuse for a work of scholarship vidal spends his time and ours entertaining personal assumptions see publishers weekly review viewpoints and pet themes why in the middle of a purported historical work on the founding fathers does he digress into making weak connections with the war in iraq his generalizations of contemporary america and other unrelated obviously biased drivel if i want politically charged opinion on the topics of the day I shall read op / ed pieces or at least something that admits it is bias from the onset if you are looking for an unbiased focused and scholarly substantive work on the topic read ellis founding brothers it won the pulitzer because it is everything inventing a nation is not,120,31
10583,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,1.0,negative,this book is all about how smart and witty vidal thinks he is why does not he just build an altar to himslef so we can all worship at his feet enough already with the same lame stuff do not expect any serious insight about the founding fathers he disguises lack of scholarship and historical understanding with dime-store psychology and tabloid journalism,61,32
10584,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,gore vidal has a field day re-examining the political and personal lives of washington adams and jefferson overall a very knowledgeable if sometimes a bit far-fetched portrait of these 3 men their strengths and their foibles vidal writes with a keen awareness of the present as he delves through the past of this great nation almost every line has some sort of resonance with the current disastrous political situation our republic finds itself in and also gives us some clues as to perhaps why we are in the mess we are in despite all the partisan issues some other reviewers may gripe about i found vidals work to be fair and very moderate in tone he calls them as he sees them and if there are jabs at our current presiding government thrown in they are all by virtue of historical truth sometimes as much as you try you can not deny what is staring you in the face,159,33
10585,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,in this vibrant book of historical nonfiction gore vidal illuminates the key figures and events that shaped the founding of the american republic he brings to life washington jefferson adams alexander hamilton and others to create a powerful portrait of americas beginnings by peering at the past we gain a better understanding of the current political climate and inventing a nation is a glorious testament to our founding colored as it is by vidals astute observations and insights,78,34
10586,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,gore vidal in his inventing a nation turns his attention to the first three presidents and the politics of the young united states the in-fighting back-stabbing manipulation and in some cases outright treason as in the case of alexander hamilton between the emerging political parties are discussed in great detail as are the personalities of the founding fathers wih this panoramic background vidal has several points to make that the nation was have today is not at all what the creators of the constitution would have imagined that we americans have surrendered many of the liberties given us by the founding fathers to the courts and corporations and that the democracy we imagine we have has in fact never been so i assume this is intended to provoke thought and reflection by readers which it does but vidal also has an ascerbic side bordering on contempt for the common american when he asserts that most americans have nowhat the electoral college is that the nation has gravely erred by attempting to export democracy beginning with our enterance into wwi and continuing to our current war on terror vidal also bitterly perhaps justly so decries the relequeshing of congressional power to declare war to the executive at the constitutional convention an elderly ben franklin remarked that we have a democracy if we can keep it vidal argues that contrary to the intentions of our founding fathers who also battled similar issues we have been unable to keep it certainly a thought-provoking read but it is sure to anger some,260,35
10587,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,i would recommend the purchase of inventing a nation the main selling point of the book is vidals unbeatable style you already know who the players are court historians have already identified them for you in gross detail two of them adorn mount rushmore gazing at a country that today they might find very strange indeed john adams did not make the cut for mount rushmore i guess you would have to ask gutzon borglum why what the court historians do not generally do is make an effort to cast the founding fathers as human beings remarkable as they were in this book we read about washingtons financial troubles with his mom jeffersons uneasy working relationship with john marshall and adams never-ending correspondence with his wife abigail along with washington adams and jefferson vidal takes time to embellish the margins of his portrait with sub-miniatures of benjamin franklin alexander hamilton john marshall james madison and the ineffable talleyrand if a bland regurgitation of dates times and places are what you are looking for look to a textbook if you are looking for a breath of fresh air and a walk among giants that were only human after all look to vidal,202,36
10588,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,i read this book after having the fun of listening to mr vidal discuss it at an event last month at the new national constitution center in philadelphia I have also taken into account some of the earlier reviews posted here i agree it is not his best work I had save that distinction for lincoln and the united states essays however it is a very thoughtful and funny piece of work vidal intends you to think about what he says there is more to history at least there should be than just getting the dates and names right if you want the life of washington read ds freeman or j t flexner if you want john adams go to david mccullough if you want jefferson see joseph ellis or even dumas malone those are first-rate biographies however what vidal attempts here generally successfully is the second part of history how does what they did reflect now what present events suggest we have not come as far as this founding trio would like see his comments on the relationship of adams alien and sedition acts to the bush patriot act it is funny elegant and enlightening i enjoyed every skewering line,197,37
10589,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,this could have been a great book had gore vidal decided that it was not about him many of his insights are excellent but marred by his acidic references to the current administration there is plenty of great material here without mr vidal deciding that it was not quite flashy enough unless he enriched it with his take on current affairs there is a certain amount of entertainment value here but it is more a sideshow than a main event,78,38
10590,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,2.0,negative,vidal is wittier than he is wise more erudite than he is intellectually honest still he is enormously entertaining and provocative for more genuine insight about the characters of the nations founding i prefer the straightforward joseph j ellis founding brothers,41,39
10591,Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,gore vidal makes the same erroneous assumption that our countrys beginning somehow magically started with washington adams and jefferson the truth of the matter is that the foundations for the nation were laid in place before any of these three great men came into power as presidents under the constitution although washington adams and jefferson were largely responsible for the implementation of the constitution they were only part of a larger mosaic of leaders who were the true founders of this nation if you want an account of the visionaries and originators of our ideas of government and the leadership that actualized these ideas into being then i suggest that you read my book entitled the first executives lives and events in the shadow of the american revolution,128,40
10592,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,the author had a lot of interesting things to say the wording was not in an easy to read format,20,0
10593,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,it reads like a novel and by a respected vatican reporter if it was by writer that lacked good credentials i would not have believed it i am a disgusted catholic with the church this tells a lot of what is going on and i believe now ratzinger could not handle the scandals the politics and the homosexual activities going on right under his nose it is something offended fallen-away catholics and the believers should read yet it angers me saddens me and nauseates me with what went on it as if everything they taught us is a bunch of lies,100,1
10594,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,this book offers the reader a good insight into the inner workings of the vatican you will get a greater understanding of the power of the curia and the gross mismanagement of church finances,34,2
10595,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,slightly confused writing some elements of the story or stories being repeated as if the original writing was in installments and lots of references for which one needs to know the rome and vatican political environment much better than an average person reading in english language am yet to finish not a gripping read as to the contents so far it includes mostly mutual complaints of vatican figures falling in and out of grace in another industry this would be boring here it amuses me insofar as it shows again that nobody is immune to that,96,3
10596,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,do not expect any source documents do not expect any real proof there are no vatileaks documents to be found here this is just your typical attack on the catholic church i was expecting a lot more like the letters everyone talks about i found nothing this book is like all other attacks there are many options to choose from this book offers nothing in particular,66,4
10597,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,i believe this author is trying to expose the corruption in the roman catholic system if he could simplify some of his specific explanations without losing his focus his writings would be easier to follow,35,5
10598,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,this book meticulously described the way the vatican functions both openly and behind the scene after reading the book i came to realize how human the popes are in spite of their assumed infallibility it became obvious that the last pope resigned due to the unbearable pressure negative from the machinations of the different actors in the affairs of the vatican indeed the pope was afraid as a result of all the deceits and secrecy that abound with those who are supposed to represent jesus christ here on earth i recommend the book to anyone who wants to see the many reasons why the pope gave up nice job gianluigi,110,6
10599,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the author never gave any facts to support his title statement that benedict xvi resigned out of fear however he did manage to paint a sad portrait of the vatican as a real snake pit full of power-lust crawling with servants of satan,43,7
10600,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,i found this book fascinating in the scope of it is revelations about the internal dealings of the vatican and the many many problems it has been dealing with but the translation into english which starts off as acceptable becomes more and more erratic in the second half of the book it was in need of a much closer textual editor to catch myriad errors of usage and expression the text is still basically readable but the reader is aware the english is somewhat substandard,84,8
10601,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,it is a tricky read a thorough knowledge of the curia will help but much of it is inside baseball and keeping track of all the players and where they fit in the org chart is tough i did not get the impression that the pope was afraid but rather he decided that trying to fix the mess was something he was not up to doing,65,9
10602,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,enjoyed the read it only re-confirmed what most rational people already have known this church has a very serious top level management problem,23,10
10603,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the hype about the book is overrated it is really a read for insiders of the church who are not part of the power structure,24,11
10604,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,too long-winded of some interest to see how the vatican runs,11,12
10605,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,it has changed my opinion of ratzinger he in not only weak but cowardly,14,13
10606,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,nothing to do with ratzinger leave confusing and sensationalist compilation of vatican scandals,13,14
10607,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,book was not good it did not meet it is stated goal of saying why pope benedict resigned let alone afraid much of the text was in the footnotes where a good author would have placed more info in the book the letters at the end were in fine-print italien unreadable on my kindle even if i could read italien i was very disappointed in this slow incoherent book do not buy it,71,15
10608,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,extremely interesting but at times a little scholarly found myself skimming over some parts this book gives some reasonable explanation for the circumstance of his retirement,26,16
10609,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,a very sad peek into a bureaucracy of backbiting control freaks no doubt the holy father had tried to do the right thing i needed to take several showers after reading this book something creepy about it,37,17
10610,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the book did not deliver even the titles expectation,9,18
10611,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,the real best seller has yet to be written that is the one which will link the mafia directly to the vatican and exposed the billions covered up in money laundering the mafia scared ratzinger that is for sure,36,19
10612,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,a good read informative material and up to date kept my attention to find out what was around the next page,20,20
10613,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,i found this book arduous to read keeping track of who everyone was is a feat in itself the scandals it talked about were not that new and frankly i found it boring if the pope stepped down for these reasons then he sounds more like a downtrodden housewife more than a head of state,56,21
10614,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,appendix contains a collection of documents from the vaticanwhose content led in part to pope ratzingers resignation book gives insight into how italian and vatican reporters see the pope the vatican and the catholic hierarchy with greater insider knowledge and without the excessive respect that often clouds american religion reporters,53,22
10615,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,this book is written for any reader who knows the ins-and outs of vatican politics and terrorism but you would have had to know pope benedict xvi as he was as cardinal ratzinger for the 19 years he worked directly under pope john paul ii to see any timid side of him it was there in his spirit but not in his edicts i feel the book has pages and pages of filler in it and will be sold based on it is title only pope benedict xvi took his decision with over a year of deep daily prayer the kind god only gifts to his popes as pope john paul ii told us had benedict done as he had planned he would have gone home to his homeland and moved into his house he and his brother owned with alibrary equal only to the vatican he did not he is secluded in rome so maybe he is doing gods will after all,163,23
10616,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,a fascinating insight into the inner workings of the vatican i found it to be a page-turner who would have thought,22,24
10617,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,this book portrays ratzinger as being a weak man caught up in a web of intriugue run by the vatican that hewas implicit in the continuation of coverof sexual abuse really belies this and his apparent inability to ring changes whilst inn the position of what we are led to believe is the most powerful position in the catholic church certainly tells the world that the catholic church hierarchy has a lot of work to do to reconnect with catholic faith it seems that the vatican can sit and write all sorts of dogma theory and encyclical papers that really are so divorced from the normal catholic practitioner a good read,113,25
10618,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,i worked inside the vatican for 13 years and thought that the information in this much-hyped book would have some insight into the resignation of pope benedict xvi i can say that the author knows little or nothing of the vatican structures and his mistakes are apparent in each section of the book so glaringly wrong such as assigning people to the wrong dicasteries or offices mixing up time lines and making insinuations without careful documentation often the documentation is another journalist or anonymous source as for the english translation it must have been done by a freshman college student just learning italian or worse an italian who never really studied english and did this by computer the errors are so many on each page that it was difficult to read trying to figure out often what the author was really trying to say nuzzi is not a good writer and a worse journalist or chronicler of events he seems to have a few axes to grind as do most italian journalists and he let us his high opinion of himself really interfere with the subject my advice do not bother buying or reading this you come away wit no more information than is already out there,209,26
10619,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,just another work of trash by people who are he shall bent on trashing the catholic church do not waste you money on this,22,27
10620,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,i found the book tedious and poorly edited decent source material but disconnected and no real narrative linkage the translation was not the best and there were numerous typos,29,28
10621,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,i did not enjoy the way the book was written however the material was interesting what ratzinger was afraid of was not very convincing,24,29
10622,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,i expected a better researched book instead it was a bit disjointed a bit of speculation a lot of hearsay not impressed it might have helped if the author had included a time line and even a who has who list of characters in the e nd not a journalistic book,50,30
10623,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,the book was more about intrigue in the vatican than specifically about the pope for the typical reader it was hard to follow and a little dull my opinion,29,31
10624,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,5.0,positive,i gave it a 5 star because i am a convert to the catholic church since 1961 and did not know about the curio and the corruption that has been going on to the extent this book explains very interesting and well worth reading,44,32
10625,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,i liked the book however there are a lot of other issues that seem to be missing ratzinger and his secretary george have become a rumored lovers also ratzinger has to live under the protection of the vatican because a lot people wan to sue him about the pedophile issues especially from the legion of christ group there are a number of other issues that should be brought up,69,33
10626,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,it seemed rather confusing and very dry but it did point up what a very human institution the church is,20,34
10627,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,a very interesting read as how the vatican a huge corporate bueracracy was run day to day just like any out of control institution there are the victims and the spoilers he inherited a mess and obviously decided he was to old to fix the mess so passed it on as i understand it he did not want the job to begin with how old do you have to be todown and get some rest i am sure many catholics will read the book and not get it i was born and raised catholic and i got it,98,35
10628,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,1.0,negative,after all the curia does this was a sleeper really there is so much going on there this was not worth it,21,36
10629,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,gianluigi nuzzi reminds me of geraldo riveras two-hour-long tv special on opening al capones old vault plenty of hype but little substance this may sell books in italy but in my humble opinion nuzzi should have saved himself the trouble and not translated this book into english,46,37
10630,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,instead of an analysis of the difficulties of the last pontificate i felt it was more gossip and defense i did not find it very insightful,26,38
10631,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,the book overall was very interesting but the translation itself was problematic and at times unclear the text itself was also riddled with grammatical errors which made for very labored reading at times,33,39
10632,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,gianluigi nuzzi makes a deep account some times boring of a few minor affairs occurred within the vatican administrative officers which are common in any human organization mostly produced by envy jealusy and ambition the reader looking for some in depth conspiration that provoked the popes resignation will be dissapointed a realistic analysys of the vatican management weakness would have been apreciated,63,40
10633,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,this book made me feel bad although it may have been the catalyst for the resignation of the pope emeritus so if that was the case then it was a good thing ratzinger reminds me of my mother who was somewhat introverted and and it is very hard to be someone you are not you could see he struggled with the papacy and good grief he was in his mid 80s he has a very cerebral way of dealing with life that is just who he is instead of supporting him the people surrounding pope benedict xvi betrayed him and it is with them the fault lies as a catholic this was a sad but not surprising book to read we have to stop making mere humans into saints and look to god alone,131,41
10634,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,the author lost my attention by the second chapter there were too many ifs and uncertainties for a book that is supposedly based on documents smuggled out of the vatican,30,42
10635,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,4.0,positive,interesting thought provoking scary read it as soon as it was released the translation was curious in some places with a few english errors did not take anything away from it just wondered who edited it,35,43
10636,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,3.0,neutral,this was a very juicy book at least the half i read however it needs a better translation to english the first few chapters can be read without much confusion but right after the first 3 chapters the quality of the translation appeared rushed and not very well thought-out unfortunately i could not find the italian version I had love to read it hopefully at some point there will be a better translation or maybe the original will be available as a kindle book magari un giorno ci sar una traduzione migliore ma purtroppo non esiste ancora,96,44
10637,Kindle_Store,B00BMLDG3O,2.0,negative,it concentrates almost exclusively on vatican infighting and questionable finances if you live in italy and know all these institutions it might interest you as for the vatican intrigues what else is new that the secretary of state was probably involved so what that the ior has to go many people left and right agree the title promises what it does not deliver so the reading is tedious read a summary and save your money,74,45
