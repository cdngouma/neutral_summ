164,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,this kit is very small everything is way smaller that you may think but the makeup itself is good quality the beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless i threw it away it is almost like a novelty toy the brush is great and so is the makeup but it is creme that means you have to put a few drops of water on theyou are using and water on the brush before using i really like the palette colors i would recommend for the price,87,24
165,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like the tacky-ness of the product it really makes powdered colors stick and look vibrant the brush and sponge did not come with the makeup i received amazon refunded the money for thisback to me and said it was ok that i kept the product since i did not receive all the pieces this made the experience super positive for me i ended up spending more money on amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one,86,25

180,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,works amazing i love the colors and it was really simple and easy to use my first time it turned out perfectly and I am loving the contour it could use a little more volume to it although there is not very much in there for 10,45,40

182,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,it is fun to use the different shades the brush spreads it on nice and feels soft i think it makes a great look,23,42
183,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,well worth the money for 10 you have a contour kit with a free brush and beauty blender the colors are alittle light but they still work they are very creamy not thick i highly recommend,36,43

187,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,one of the better ones i have tried matches skin and does not make me break out if i accidentally leave it on overnight,23,47
188,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,i would never buy this product again or recommend to anyone the creams are so terrible they can barely be applied they are not spreadable i might just throw this right out a day after it came in the mail so disappointing,41,48
189,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this sucked did not work at all i would never buy this again i was extremely dissapointed,16,49

191,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,this was a multi purpose pallet that i loved to use i am planning on purchasing a new one as i just recently went through my last one after almost 2 years,32,51
192,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,i have ordered this over and over again love it,10,52
193,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i like this product just fine for the price i have another set by another company and they are about the same it is not supposed to be clown make up I am satisfied with it there has something for all skin tones,40,53
194,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i actually really like it I am a tomboy so i do not do makeup when i got the pallet i just went on youtube for how tos and i really like the look gave it 4 stars because it is a little thick but good,40,54
195,All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,this was terrible it almost looks like a kids set for makeup plastic i could not even use it really because the contour will not even come out of the circle with the brush do not waste your money,38,55
526,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,hi this is a great phone bluetooth syncs with my mac perfectly all functions i need are available intuitively and easily it is the details with this phone that i love the rounded buttons which allow even my huge hands to type with ease the strong construction the bright and great in sunlight tft screen the ability for it to use my calling cards and enter the numbers for me the sms and data counters the post-it notes feature the alarm the games the big stuff rf and sound are great battery life i have found to be good they clam something like 300 hours in the specs but i would say more like 150 still this is pretty good the camera is only decent but i do not consider this a big deal it is for fun and it achieves that goal fine the menus are fast and access to numbers is easy the phone is small and stylish is smaller than my old t720 if you include the antenna which you must ouch obviously you can pay more and get better phones but for the great price it is selling for now net 50 return with new 1yr contract i do not think you can go wrong especially if you want a candy-bar style best of luck rob,223,0
527,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,been using this phone for 3 weeks now and i love it i got one of those screen protector things definitely get one the menu is easy once you get used to the keys since i have had nokias before the menu / navigation is slightly different i also got a bluetooth usb adapter which makes transferring ringtones and pictures as easy as ever i just transferred my entire phonebook through outlook in one easy click the camera takes ok-ok pictures nothing close to a one megapixel digicam I have seen my friends samsung e715 and this screen is waaaay better the colors are more vivid the only drawback is no mp3 / voice ringers if you are into that but the polyphonic ringtones in my opinion are more than enough you can transfer any midi file instrumental to your phone you can even assign pictures to your contacts so that their face shows up when they call supercool phone would buy it again anytime remember to charge it overnight the first time although,168,1
528,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,coming from a t68i it is hard not to like this phone the reception is 10x better the camera is easy to use and the resolution beats anything I have had before i have the t226 as a backup and it is performance is what convinced me to buy a t637 i clung to the t68i for it is features bluetooth mainly and resigned myself to a nonbluetooth t226 when reception was poor now i have it all I am not wild about the form factor but hey performance is key,87,2
529,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,the phone works ok unfortunately have never used a t610/616 extensively so i can not compare to say what has improved reception is ok screen looks good the keypad and area above the screen with sony ericsson are a lot closer to grey than black and the sides are silver it just does not look good together i wish they had made the t637 in frosty white like the mainstream t630 i saw that phone in person and it is cute btw i purchased this phone at a cingular store without service and it came gsm unlocked so my t-mobile sim card works in it i can not vouch for the ones sold online the included java chat client aim icq cingular msging does not seem to work through t-mo but that is probably to be expected other nitpicks no quick access user-settable / programmable keystrokes or menu sim card entries are second-class and a pain to navigate to default ringtones are peculiar / bizarre imho too many keystrokes to delete t-mos inane you have voicemail sms msgs although i blame that retarded system more on t-mo my joystick is not quite centered when at rest -p,192,3
530,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is just a quick response to lixin li who dissed the ericsson t637 for the big internet m-mode button that charges you when accidently hitting it well if you knew anything about the phone you would turn on the automatic keylock and not have this problem well what do you know there no more charges thanks sony for a great phone [ i had to clear this up because it is people that lixin li who diss a great phone they do not even know how to use ],85,4
531,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is a great phone with excellent battery life i can usually go four or five days without having to recharge the battery that is just awesome the ringer volume is loud and the screen is bright you will never have to pay for a ringtone or game again thanks to the excellent bluetooth support performance of java games is sluggish that is my only complaint you may want to spend some time searching for mophun games as those are much more responsive and smooth a lot of the negative reviews here make reference to the online button being too-easily-pushed that may be true but let me tell you something this is not a flip-phone this is a candy-bar style phone non-flip-phones usually have a mechanism that locks the keypad when the phone is not in use so that random buttons do not get pushed when they are in your pocket or purse or whatever if you are too stupid to turn this lock on when you are not using the phone or to enable the auto-lock function then you do not deserve to own a mobile phone period,180,5
532,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,i had this phone through cingular and i had alot of problems with it first of all the small size and crammed arrangement of the buttons made it hard to type a phone number in the keys are slippery and thus my fingers were always missing second the online button on the side is way too easy to push and my phone was always connecting to the internet when i was least expecting it and running up charges third cingular does not make it easy to see if you are roaming or not on this particular phone which accounted for 3000 in spurious roaming charges being accrued over a course of 3 months this combined with cingulars really bad customer service they kept shutting my phone off and the regional director finally had to personally intervene in my case made for one bad experience translated do not buy this phone if you live near the canadian border cuz this phone will not tell you if you are roaming or not better yet steer clear of cingular as well,173,6
533,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,first of all let me say this is a great phone i will note a few important things 1 it is a smaaal phone the buttons are small if you have a large hand or fingers it is going to be hard to grasp the phone properly i have average hands and it was hard for me 2 no speakerphone this is a huge downside 3 there is an online button conveniently accessable which can be mistakenly pressed and you will never know you went online and you were being charged 4 camera sucks it is a very basic one you have to be standing within 2 feet of the subject to get a recognizable picture pros 1 crisp large display 2 sleek looking 3 lot of great personalization tools within the phone 4 bluetooth 5 better reception than most phones,138,7
534,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is the best cell phone i have ever owned it lights up brightly with large digits that you can see without glasses it goes 5 - 6 days without charging for light use although i ordered cases they are unnecessary as the phone is small enough to comfortably and inconspicuously fit in any front pant pocket it has no protruding antenna to break off and require replacement when talking from houston to lubbock i actually have to hold it away from my ear because of loudness it even has a camera in it is small size best of all it is logical and user friendly with frequently-used operations requiring only 1 keystroke or 2 at the most although available in after market sony could have easily made a dual charger to handle a spare change-out battery,134,8
535,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,i am wondering why there is no rating of 0 star or even negative stars sony errison desnt even deserve the 1 star i chose this riduculosly stupid phone has one big button and a so-called joystick both just need one single touch for you to get into the m-mode and get charged by every bit of data transferred to your phone and there is absolutely no way to deactiviate it even if you spend more than two hours to just get the unprofessional at t or cingular customer service to deactivate this stupid service on their end another stupid thing is that they send me a software cd which is totally crap there is nothing in the package talking about the cd but i just thought why would not have a try the stupid hand-made-like software just can never be succefully installed and what is worse is that you can no longer uninstall it either [ ],155,9
536,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,i just got this phone from my friend and i must say that i was first skeptical about the phone and how it would perform against my motorola v551 but i must say it is a great performer i tested out the internal antenna of the phone and i think that the reception on this is superior than that of the v551 in areas where my old phone had minimial signal i had 3 bars the speaker phone sounds good and the battery life of this phone kicks major butt the only disappointment that you might have is that there is no holster for these candy bar type phones you basically are left out and if you are not careful you will scratch the screen like i did my keys were in the same pocket and i forgot about the delicate display i will be buying pda clear covers for the screen soon i learned my lesson the hard way as for the camera it is pretty fuzzy and i do not like it the bluetooth syncs up with my computer fine and works wonders when combined with the right headset I have gotten no drop calls or anything but sometimes the buttons can me small for big fingers get this phone it will be worth it,210,10
537,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,this phone is really cute but it is so hard to use it does not matter you have to put the phone on key lock otherwise it will easily go onto the internet if you leave it in your bag in order to turn the volume down or off you have to go through settings there is no quicker way while talking the phone goes in and out and makes it hard to hear even when there is full service basically the phone is super cute but is so hard to use it is not worth it even if it is free i will say that cingular / atts service is really good i have not been anywhere where i do not have service yet and I have owned it a month,125,11
538,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,i spent over 2 hours researching a plan and phone with amazon went through their order process which is already a pain for cell service forms do not remember all data if there is an error cmon i get better service from mom and pop web sites and then this morning get a vague email that cingular needs more information and my order has been cancelled I have been a heavy user of amazon for 6 years but i doubt i will ever try to get cell service from them again because the order process and site navigation is horrible i am really surprised amazon would maintain this poor level of service,111,12
539,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,get this phone unlocked and use on t-mobile reception on 1900 is excellent comaprable with original n-gage voice is good both from phone itself and bt headset bluetooth is reliable no problem with dell axim like nokia 6820 but the gprs setting has some problem that you may have headache if you have more than one gprs apn it do not have option to let you choose apn the ringtone is okay simply transfer some from computer through bluetooth supports mid even i put t-jingle on it the phone supports class 8 gprs which you can get the fastest possible speed when using as modem achieving 56k like speed another downside is the phone do not have speakerphone which is available for most of nokia and moto phones withsupport will be a big plus lcd is very good both indoors and outdoors but the white is not even if you look at it sideways this phone is highly recommended for att cingular and t-mobile users,165,13
540,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,my review is on cingular i bought a phone w / service and was told i could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used they lie the phone did not work in my area and i cancelled the next day they are charging me for activation even although it never worked in my area if you are uncertain you will keep the phone and service do not buy from cingular amazon will also do nothing to reimburse,79,14
541,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,well i got this phone with a cingular package the phone is tiny and cute it is well built and has lots of connectivity however it has some serious drawbacks from the usability point of view 1 it maybe just me but i can not seem to find how to input a wait sign for example if i want to input an extension number i do not know how in my old motorola phone i just just insert a wait synbol and it is done i do not even need to consult user manual to figure that out for this phone i read through the user manual and still can not find how 2 i make international phone calls often and there is a calling card feature in this phone that allows you to call a number using specified phone card with password all these are nice with one fatal drawback once the phone connects with phone card number it will wait only for 2 seconds before it dial the phone number you want to reach 2 second it not enough for any of my phone cards to confirm the password overall this is a good looking nice and little hard to use phone good thing for it is it is connectivity which is outstanding easy to use it does not even match my old motorola v120c,220,15
542,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,while gsm seems like universal mobile phone standard the carrier frequency may throw a curve ball to unlocked phone the 900/1800/1900 unlocked phone became useless on phila cingular network,29,16
543,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,the phone itself is wonderful good reception easy to use bluetooth it uses java for some applications and games which is cool it also has icq and aim which is a plus another cool feature is music dj in which you can create your own polyphonic tunes midi one button push will get you online your phonebook has space for more than one phone number home work mobile plus it has a space for email you can set up special ring tones for different people in your phone book you can also take a picture of that contact and the picture will pop up when that person calls it is a coolto have a single push of a button to turn on the camera and allow you to email the picture to someone after saving the picture you can save it as wallpaper for your camera and you can send it as a mms or via bluetooth or via infrared ir the camera is not that good people need to be 3 - 4 feet away to get a clear picture of their face any further than 4 feet and nothing is clear feature-wise but i did not buy the phone for the camera quality the camera is a perk if you want to buy a sony ericsson for the camera quality I had purchase the s710a which has a 13 megapixel built into it or the z500a which does video and 3x zoom the my previous phone was a sony ericsson t68i the reasons i stayed with sony ericsson is easy to use lots of options and the biggest reason bluetooth wireless is the way to go i gave this camera 4 stars because it rocks if the camera would have been better it would have gotten 5 stars,298,17
544,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,i purchased this phone for each of the members of our company and thus far we have all been pleased with it the bluetooth technology in the phone works just as advertised the phone book entries store multiple numbers to a single name so joe schmo has a home phone work phone and cell phone but only one entry in the address look up this is much improved i would strongly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a bluetooth enabled phone i synch my calendar tasks and email with the phone like a pda and use a wireless headset jabra bt200 and love it,109,18
545,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,beware of buying this phone from amazon with cingular i tried buying this phone from amazoncom with amazoncom as the seller i finished the checkout process and then in 5 mins i got an email from amazoncom saying your order has been cancelled because cingular needed some additional information which we can not provide a ridiculous reason to put it mildly could not they have asked me for that information i later tried for a customer service phone but could not find one all i found was an email address and i emailed them and got a reply after 2 days saying that they can not do anything later i bought another cingular phone at letstalkcom and during the checkout process they asked me a lot of questions additional information according to amazoncom and i got the phone without any hassles i even ported my old phone number such a ridiculous service could be expected of amazoncom only i do not understand why they sell cellphones when they do not know how to do it if anyone wants to contact me send me an email at rphanikanth yahoocom,182,19
546,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,one thing for sure the service of amazon is not what i had expected initially the when the order was placed amazon cancelled the order in about 4 - 5 hours the reason gives was cingular can not process your order on the information given since amazon does not have the requirements that cingular wants we are cancelling your order awww cmon amazon if you can not communicate with cingular i guess then you guys should not be doing business with cingular or there should be a statement somewhere stating that the order can be cancelled for any reason the prime being cosmic radiaton so i tried placing the order again it was processed after about 4 - 5 futile attempts and the information that was provided was the identical as the first time the estimated delivery date was 10th sept so far it was a struggle so i checked the status of the order a day later and the estimate delivery date is oct 12th wow so much so for stating that thisships in 24 hrs it has been a fustrating experience so far will wait for a day or so else there are other places online that can be given a try do not buy from amazon,204,20
547,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,do not even buy this fone it has the worst reception and will drop ur call if the reception is weak on cingular motorolas v300 and above are the best fones i have this on cingular and even in places where the v300 picks up signal this one does not do not even try to buy,55,21
548,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,i have used half a dozen cell phones in the past five years and this phone had the worst reception hands down the background noise was so loud people on the other end of the phone thought i was being attacked by wild pigs,44,22
549,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,1.0,negative,three times i tried ordering through amazon and all times the order was cancelled with cingular is requesting information that we can not provide so we are cancelling the order intead of just asking the customer for the information so i called customer service yeah do not try finding that number here on the website i had google it because the only time they give it to you is on the page displayed right after your order not on any of the emails you get to be told they are a new carrier for us and we can not do anything we tell customers that get cancelled orders that basically sorry you are out of luck direct quote from customer service representative would have been a good deal if i could have gotten it maybe it is because I am an existing att customer,133,23
550,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,i just bought this phone five days ago and my experience has been great themonitor is clear the camera is as good as the motorolas and better than nokia 3200 i love that i can customize the phone such as changing the wall paper i also have it setup to synchronize the contact information with my pc ms outlook via bluetooth and the software that comes with it it really works great the phone is so light and the screen saver just works well you do not have to worry about accidentally press a key the previously comments about the screen saver is right although it is no use to change the screen saver you can not see it anyway the voice control works fine too with this phone you can give voice tag for all of your contacts and also record commands such as redail and number type work mobile home the phone really recognizes my voice the phone has such rich features it is true that it takes time to explore and study the manual so that you can take full advantages of it but i think it is well worth it,195,24
551,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,it reads great do not get me wrong but the interface is miserable and the speaker picks up everything around you when you are on the phone I have had half a dozen mobile phones over the last decade and this is the first one where i had to access the menu system to turn down the ringer the buttons on the side with nope they show the phone status i hate phones you need to read the manual to use there has no excuse for it,85,25
552,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,5.0,positive,this is a cool phone with lots of subtle features the battery-life is good but you really have to explore to discover the most powerful things about it continued i have been using this same phone for a couple of years now and just so everyone knows it is still working well I have probably dropped it fro 5 feet in the air at least 6 times,66,26
553,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,2.0,negative,the camera is horrible there has a screensaver function but the screensaver only comes on for about a second because the phone goes into standby mode in two seconds no way to change that you can create only one true shortcut interface seems to be geared toward getting you online to buy more pictures and ringtones you need to buy a proprietary headset if you like to customize the settings on your phone i suggest you stay away from this one,80,27
554,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,3.0,neutral,just got the phone but there was a fuzz sound or low humming coming out regardless of who i called or how high the volume was seems like a great phone otherwise is anyone else having similar problems,38,28
555,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00028YSDK,4.0,positive,maybe i was too generous in giving 4 stars should have been 3 or 3 and a half the phone is very attractive and light weight but the battery drains so quickly despite of their claim of 540 minutes of talk time and 300 hours of stand-by time after using for a day the battery meter becomes yellow short bar warning sign that the battery is almost completely drained talk about 2 hours and stand-by for 22 hours also the voice volume is not as loud i live and work in manhattan as a sales rep meaning most of the calls i receive and make are done so outside even with the loudes setting i sometimes can not hear callers voice also several people made comments that the background noise level that they hear are excruciatingly loud i never had this problem with my former nokia or motorola phones i am also not so thrilled about cingular their customer service closes so early during the weekdays i believe it is around 9 pm and they are closed on sundays all other carriers that i had sprint verizon and t-mobile had customer service 24/7 also the phone keeps asking if i want to update the time like every hour i called cingular but there was nothing they could do they said that it was because of the phone not it is service i have a friend who has motorola v400 and he swears it is the best phone i also have talked to several people at cingular and they personaly use v400 or v600 so you may want to opt for these phones instead of t637,277,29
914,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this iphone holder is great it arrived in less than 5 days and is much cooler in person than pictured i was not sure if i would like the looks of it as the picture on the site is not great but i am so very pleased i can not wait to put my iphone in it have to wait till christmas morning o would highly recommend this product i think i am going to get green and orange as well o,78,0
915,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,great price for an excellent case and i have looked at a lot of them i liked this one so much i bought another in green they look and feel great if you use a screen protector you may have to trim it on the bottom corners because this case fits so snug,53,1
916,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,I am mostly writting this review due to my displeasure with eforcity the vendor that sells this product through amazon one thing I have always loved about amazon is the fast shipping this vendor has had my order since monday four days and it still has not shipped i was actually hoping to have it today or tomorrow i will probably avoid any purchases through this vendor in the future,68,2
917,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i purchased this case to replace a rubber case which was difficult to get out of pockets i like the soft-touch feel allowing it to slide easily in / out of my pockets two issues the screen protectors are pretty cheap just get the crystal film if you want a screen protector and thewas too lipsticky for my tastes i purchased the same case in orange / black and am much more pleased,71,3
918,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is a cool sleek case for the iphone 3 g it fits like a glove and does not add any bulk to the overall size of the iphone so it still fits in your pocket or other small compartments the cutouts keep your control buttons and camera lens usable the case is very comfortable to hold and definitely keeps the iphone from slipping out of your hand so easily that in itself makes it worth the money it looks great and the ifrogz logo is barely visible so it does not look tacky one thing i really like is that you can slip the case over the touchscreen to protect it if you know it is going to be in harms way for example in the bottom of your purse or other bag for a long time the controls are not usable when the case is in that position but your screen is protected this is a great protector for my new favorite gadget,162,4
919,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is the 3rd case I have gotten for various iphones and it is absolutely the best looking case i actually got it in metallic orange seriously the geniuss at the apple store were ooohing and ahhhing asking me where i got it fits snugly and covers all areas but the buttons earphone jack and screen covers all but a sliver of the silver bezel on the front and i believe it will stop any scratches and dents happening on the bezel very happy with it and I am thinking of getting anothertoo bad they do not make them for the original iphone because my wife is jealous,107,5
920,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i do not own a 3 g cell anymore but at the time this was a good case i still have the cell and the phone but not in service,29,6
921,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,it lasted me about a year before it cracked and broke it is of good quality and fit my iphone 3s perfectly the shipment was very good and quick,28,7
922,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this case offers far better protection for your device than most others two piece cases are a little bulkier but it is worth the extra size considering the enhanced protection,29,8
923,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,fit the basic need that i was looking for i was looking to replace a replica phone case this is great,21,9
924,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,looked great but broke far too easily i ended up buying 3 in total because of the looks terrible durability,20,10
925,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,it looked good in the pic but when it came it was just cheap plastic i ended up buying a different case and giving this one away,27,11
926,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i was not madly in love with this product but i used it for several months the texture was good easy to hold not to sticky or gummy did not stick to my hair but it was a little thin and ultimately ended up cracking,44,12
927,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,we totally love our ifrogz covers the other ones that are marketed do not provide that much protection and for an expensive phone i want to make sure i get all the protection i can get,35,13
928,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,my old case for my iphone showed much wear and tear parts of the case were broken i lucked out to find this one to fit my iphone 3 gs looks like new and such a great price including shipping,40,14
929,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,worked well with my 3 g no complaints however i have moved on to the iphone 4 and use the ballistic case,21,15
930,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i did not notice at the time of purchase that it said the side tabs were broken they were and the case would come apart every time my husband took it out of his pocket my fault missed the fine print buyer beware i purchase it because i have the same in pink and it is practially in destructible,58,16
931,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i got this for my mom to put on her phone and she absolutely loves it the colors are vibrant and it is decent protection,25,17
932,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,most cases are not made for the 3gs since the newer iphones started coming out and whenever my case gets damaged or breaks from dropping it i buy another one of these they protect the phone and instead break themselves the point of a case it is cheap too which is the best part they do not stick in your pocket like most rubber / plastic cases of this sort which is nice,70,18
933,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i got this case one and loved it then got it a second time and it was a total piece of crap it lasted like 3 weeks the first one was great and lasted 6 months or more the second one would not stay together on my phone kept falling apart,51,19
934,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love my phone case and the timing that i received it in this is the third case i have owned and i love it,25,20
935,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i ordered this exact case when i first got my phone a year and a half ago and it was great this time around it has cracked and chipped away within days of purchasing it the fit was slightly off and overall has been disappointing,45,21
936,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i recently bought a used iphone and wanted a case the cover some flaws on the back side of the phone this case did exactly what i wanted it made my used phone look new but did not add bulk the price on amazon made this case a good buy i would not pay the price they sell for in the stores the only reason i gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 is that i have had issues with getting the two pieces to meet up well when putting the case on after a minute or two of messing with it it went together fine and has stayed in place since it is not a huge issue since i rarely remove the case but none the less was a bit of an hassle to get on,136,22
937,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this is at least the third such case that i have bought and the previous ones lasted about 6 months before the side locking clips broke this last one lasted less than a week before the locking side clips broke no longer an acceptable product even if it is inexpensive,51,23
938,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,just as described works great i would buy thisagain seller was awesome well put together and easy install on my phone much cheaper than a retail store,29,24
939,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i just started using this cover 1 week ago and the red is chipping off the corners it is a nice case but it is going to look pretty shabby very quickly I am glad i only paid a little over 3 for it one other thing that drives me nuts is that when it is sitting flat on my desk and i touch the screen it does not sit flat because of the button on the back so when i touch the screen it wobbles a lot it also does not have as much traction as my old case so it slides around in my car the case will do it is job but i would not pay more than 5 for it,118,25
940,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,I am guessing few will ever read this review as it is for a case for a phone not even made anymore i have an older 3gs which i love i bought this case a while back for over 30 and it lasted about two years it is a great case that has definitely saved my phone on a number of occasions i like it a lot it feels nice and keeps the phone looking sharp the fact you can now buy it for a small fraction of the original cost is just extra sweetness,92,26
941,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,when i got this phone case i was not expecting much from it but the second i put that case on my phone i knew that was the case for me it is awesome looking it is comfortable to hold and it is down right awesome i defineteley reccommend this case,50,27
942,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,received case ahead of scheduled delivery date my son loves the case but i am not as happy the bottom piece covers the bottom phone corners great but the top piece does not cover the corners completely like the bottom piece does great colors and on the inside of the case has a felt cloth so the case does not scratch the back of iphone which is a great feature because all other cases we have had have done just that scratched the iphone so when iphone is out of the case it looks horrible updated 7/3/12 the case comes with a screen protector which is great because we needed to replace the one on his phone,117,28
943,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i had the same case on my iphone before and it lasted 3 years real happy with the replacement although the side clip broke after 1 month not a big deal much better then all the e-bay crap cases they sell,41,29
944,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,ordered plastic pull apart cover for my 3 g iphone i got what i paid for very cheap separates easy and comes apart when i take out of my pocket not impressed,31,30
945,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this cost effective candycase was really worth buying it fits in nicely to my costly phone giving worth for money i paid to get this case really love it,29,31
946,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this was exactly what i was looking for it was brand new in the original package the price was very good and the delivery was quick i gave this 5 stars,31,32
947,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,the i-phone cover is fine but slides apart very slightly where the two pieces join i had one like this in the past but think this one must be an older version the button to release the phone is larger and more convex than the other one i had and i think general usage pushes the button more and causes the slight separation it is not a major problem but just a bit of a nuisance still like the case,80,33
948,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,1is really nice to match my bag 2 the hardcase is kinda cheap material and it will not really protect your iphone from falls it is just a protective case,34,34
949,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i love this case and it only had two glaring issues for me it is hard to remove because of the design has you push on piece and pull on another to get it unlatched the other issue is that it is bottom is a little thick so it can get in the way on some accessories did not work with a keyboard i found but works great with my alarm clock other then that this case literally saved my ipod i fell down the stair and my ipod flew onto hard tile / cement and came out with only a little crack on the corner of the screen it could have been way worse but the case saved it also i do like how the case looks and feels in my hand,130,35
950,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,the case came quickly it works and the quality is exceptional no complaints from me it has breathed new life into my iphone 3gs,24,36
951,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love my ifrogz case exactly what i expected the service was fantastic excellent seller thank you so much,19,37
952,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this is a piece of junk the tabs broke off the first time i went to put the case on my phone not worth the money,26,38
953,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,good product offers good phone protection for a mid class product if higher end basic protection is what your after then this works well easily slides in and out of pockets yet has a non slip grip not for any high abuse situations or excessive pocket stress,47,39
954,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the e-mail i sent to phonenerds was never responded to the case came close to the outside of the delivery deadline the case fits on the phone and is loose,30,40
955,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this cover is very solid it fits perfectly and theis rich it makes my phone look great i would love to buy one in purple my husband recommended this brand as he had great luck with one of these covers as well you will not go wrong ordering one of these ifrogz i received my shipment very quickly,59,41
956,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,great looking and has a nice feel to it fits very snugly on the iphone 3gs maybe too snugly as within two months the connection between the top piece and the bottom piece broke off quality consturction on the top and bottom pieces except where they snap together maybe i just received a lemon,54,42
957,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,good cheap case I have it for months now and have not had any problems with them chipping or paint coming off and I am fairly abusive to my iphone I am an auto tech,31,43
958,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i bought this case about 6 months ago and it has protected my itouch from drops scratches stomps and more the number one characteristic that makes this case one of the best is the small lip it has over the sides of the screen while many hard cases out there do not have this feature it is absolutely essential when it comes to protecting the screen so many times i have dropped my itouch screen first on the pavement and gravel and surely anyone would expect to see various scratches on the screen but no not with this case i do not really write reviews but this case has been so good to my itouch and i that i hope others can benefit from it is excellent protection,125,44
959,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i liked the case for about 2 weeks after i got it then it began chipping and peeling after 3 months i had to throw it away because it was so torn up it was embarrassing to carry around i think all the good reviews were written by people who just bought the case do not waste your money,59,45
960,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i carry my phone in my pocket along with keys and other items a phone case must be tough it needs to protect the phone when i got the case i really loved it the design is nice enough and theand satiny feel were really amazing within 3 days the case was totally covered with scratches so much for the good looks within a month the tabs that hold the two halves together were broken it was very loose and came off from time to time i tossed it and bought an incase slider case for iphone 3gs metallic orange instead it was expensive but has been very durable,113,46
961,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the case itself is very attractive but cheaply made the bottom piece just under the iphone button broke off within a couple of weeks of use i replaced it with a completely different case,34,47
962,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,not a bad case especially considering the price it is a pain to put in and out of the case so if youror any cables that use daily with your phone and you need to constantly remove the case it gets cumbersome other than that not too bad,49,48
963,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,my 3gs fits in the case well not too tight or too loose case closes up and opens up easily to me the button lock on the back does not because a rocking issue when laying the phone on a hard surface to type,44,49
964,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,from the beginning this case which actually is quite good looking did not work it did not click together well and everytime it came out of my pocket it would come apart within a month the edges where the two pieces meet in the front chipped and made the bad connection even worse i would not recommend this product,57,50
965,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i had originally bought the same case from an at t store when i bought my phone about a year and a half ago the clips holding the two pieces together broke after about a year i would not buy the same case for the price i originally paid 20 but have no problem shelling out under 4 bucks for a replacement in fact i bought 2 so that i will not have to buy another one again,75,51
966,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,it is worth what you pay for cheap plastic breaks easily and I have heard of other people who dropped their phone with this case and still cracked a screen it is better than no case but I am shopping for a different case now edit case broke and became unusable after 2 - 3 months i went with otterbox impact case it is much better in every aspect feels much more secure and has held up much better currently the same price on amazon changed the review from 2 to 1 star there is no instance i would recommend this to anyone given other products on the market,102,52
967,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,the case is really nice not like the cheap one sold in the market it looks expensive and feels expensive i love the case so much i have used the case for a month but it is broken now after it slipped from my hand it is very fragile not a tough case at all but it looks gorgeous on the iphone,60,53
968,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,these cases look good and are worth the under 4 price on amazon i do not think the case will be durable over a long period but at the price replacement is no problem and for now the case is just fine,40,54
969,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i have 1 of these in everyfunctionality and stylish what more could a girl ask for,18,55
970,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i used one of these cases for a while and my iphone withstood many falls until it did not my phone did drop from a stage in a theater about 10 feet on to wood so I am not sure i can fault the case too much for that still disappointing,49,56
971,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case is not a substitute for the sturdy hard rubber and plastic alternatives but it does not cost as much as is much more attractive I have had mine for a couple of months and there are no scratches or dings on it so it is tougher than i thought it would be a colleague saw mine and ordered one like it for herself there are lots of attractivechoices,68,57
972,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the short story is that this completely broke after 2 months gentle use ifrogz appears to be making these more cheaply there is a huge quality difference and i would never purchase again i bought this as a replacement case when my first ifrogz case became dull and scratched after a year of normal wear and tear i had been pleased with the performance of the original although the screen protector did produce an unusual amount of bubbles between the screen and film my order for the replacement was damaged on arrival and my ifrogz customer service experience was not satisfactory it was clearly a production problem not a shipping issue and they did not want to deal with it at all my intent had been to give them a heads up as much as to request a replacement so they clearly do not care about quality control amazon took care of it but the replacement for that also appeared more flimsy than the original i was suspicious same screen protector issue too and what do you know the pieces of plastic holding it together on the sides totally busted shortly thereafter out of nowhere they were unusually difficult to put together too there are better cases out there do not waste your money on this you will just have to replace it soon anyway,221,58
973,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,not a bad product i have owned two the tabs at the side that hold the case together break after a couple of months good for the price but beware it may not last too long,36,59
974,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,did not fit my 3gs right from the get go could not get the 2 pieces to click together properly finally broke after 2 weeks,23,60
975,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i picked this up because it was on sale at an unbelievably low price the case itself does not look too bad and it is thin enough to not be obtrusive but the 2 pieces do not really lock together so they separate pretty often without even pressing what looks like a release button it is annoying enough to make the case not worth using the only redeemer is that it came with a screen protector and it was actually cheaper to buy this case then most other protectors on the site so at least i have that out of the deal i can not speak to the quality of the screen protector as i already have a phone devil on my screen but if that ever fails me at least i have a backup now i also picked up an elago s3 case for iphone 3g/3gs and I had highly recommend you skip this one and spend the extra cash for the elago update after having it collect dust for a while i finally put my ifrogz in it is proper place the trash the elago remains amazing again spend the money on a better case even if it is not the elago you will be glad you did,202,61
976,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i purchased this case almost two years ago i chose thisbecause it looks great in dark red the quality of the case is excellent it has two segments which attach at the middle-lower portion and cover the phone theof the case extends over theof the phone very slightly maybe a millimeter and this protects theand front against flat surface damage my only complaint is that the hard she shall plastic case can accumulate dust inside it and needs to be opened once in a while to be cleaned i think this is a problem with almost all cases anyways so it is nothing special I have dropped my iphone 3 g numerous times while i had this case and it protected the phone very well it is not too large and it looks slick the coloring available in multiple colors is great and the case itself is very durable provides excellent protections and beats almost any rubber case i highly recommended this case and it is brand from my experiences,172,62
977,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,great thin look and feel to the case will not fit into the case with a invisible shield screen protector on your iphone it is such a tight fit that it keeps scraping up the screen protector I am sorry but I am not going to trust this case without a screen and back protector what a disappointment,55,63
978,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,within days of using this product it began to crack and fall apart it is a terrible disappointment,18,64
979,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,when i received this case the first thing that i noticed was the awesomeit is bright and bold and beautiful but already before i had even started using it the felt was peeling off and there was an important piece chipped off so i went to amazon to get a return and within 5 minutes they had already emailed me back and shipped a new one so hats off to you amazon,73,65
980,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i am disappointed in this puchase although it was cheap and therefore not worth returning i had to give my feedback first the case does not properly fit the gs version that i have or if it does it is not an easy snap on cover as i thought it would be secondly the clear plastic shield that goes on the front of the phone came with a sticker on it that does not come off easily not worth the trouble of trying to get the gummy stuff off of it was in the trash within 15 minutes of receipt,100,66
981,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this is a very nice good looking case it comes with the clear cover protectant to protect the front too a great price delivered at 350 thank you amazon this will not protect the i-phone like the full rubber case but it is fine,42,67
982,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,I am getting ready to order my 3rd one of these cases in less than a year as they only last a few months before breaking fortunately the amazon price allows these to be treated as disposable after just a few months i treat my phone very carefully and have never dropped yet yet the fragile pieces of plastic that connect the top of the case to the bottom of the case break off very easily in my experience they break within the first 12 months but i like the minimal bulk of these cases and they seem to do a decent job of protecting the phone although i have never dropped my phone to find out if you order this case perhaps just order 2 or 3 of them at a time this still may be less expensive than just 1 of the more expensive cases,146,68
983,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,the case looks nice and the material is soft but less than 3 months after i bought it cracked on the sides in the junction of the two parts of the case now i does not look that nice anymore well i guess you get what you paid for,47,69
984,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i applied a screen protector and this case has such a tight fit that it will not fit on the iphone without trimming the edgesof the screen protector and now the locking ring on the back does not function correctly also when grabbed in normal operation the case somehow squeezes the iphone in such a way that it changes the volume when music is playing that can not be good,67,70
985,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,does this cheap case work better than a 30 case no but it does not need to it has it is flaws it feels loose it does not work well with certain stands or other accessories but it is good things outweigh them dirt cheap simple to use easy to take off and on as needed felt background keeps back from getting extra scratches,60,71
986,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,stylish case with a nice texture feels like a fusion of velvet and rubber fits iphone well without obstructing the camera lens orconnector although the cutout around the volume controls looks much larger than necessary the only practical issue is the little raised button on the back of this case makes it more difficult to lay iphone flat on a table,63,72
987,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,works well and for the price it is perfect ps fits snugg and tight with my 3gs,18,73
988,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i bought this today because i loved the matte finish and sleek design after i had applied a screen cover to my new iphone i went to put this case on and to my horror it ripped the screen protector i kept trying to push the two parts together very slow so that the screen protector would not move but it kept pushing it around and creating bubbles after ten minutes of fighting with it i decided to not put it on and i turned the phone around and there were scratches along thewhere the case slides together all in all it was not worth the money i spent on it and i will probably go back to the jelly cases I have used in the past,126,74
989,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i got the red / black case for the 3gs this thing just looks killer and fits very tight the case is not meant to be taken on / off often because it fits so snugly the same kind of case for the iphone4 apparently gets bad reviews i feel like I am keeping my 3gs because the case is so cool,55,75
990,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i love this product I am a super researcher nd always search for the best deal i almost went with a knock off for half the price do not do it this one is awesome and a steal at the price amazon is offering it for it is the best price i found for the name brand it is sleek feels great in your hand feels very sturdy and is super stylish in a versatile way that is great for the male or female user i would have given 5 stars but for some reason mine does not click into place that is i do not have to press the button to remove the bottom case but it fits so perfectly there is no danger of the bottom slipping off i also took away one star because the design does expose too much of the phone around the volume and mute keys but this is great you are going to be hard-pressed to find a better looking and functioning case at this price,164,76
991,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,mine is a pretty red and black case with an intriguing and novel puzzle-piece form which is why it caught my eye since i am not prone to rough handling my new iphone 4 i am dismayed to find that in just three weeks the paint has chipped all the way around the red metal part if you are constantly shoving your phone in and out of your pocket as i do then skip this phone case it seems tomore toward being decorative than being a work horse admittedly although it is a rather cool case amazon does not have the 4 yet but i thought i would warn people that the design of the new case seems not to have been improved since the 3 g case listed here,130,77
992,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,if you need something functional and fast this is the case for you it slides easily into pocket or purse it is visible and feel good in your hand i was very satisfied,33,78
993,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case has been great for my iphone3 I have loved it it is protected my phone from a few falls i only wish they made the metallica bit more durable as it looks worn pretty quickly and i wish they sent you a second clear covering as these get bubbly and worn out fast too but the does what is supposed to do without being bulky highly recommend it,70,79
994,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the cut out portions around the lock volume and silence buttons are deep enough to inhibit use basically the case makes it hard to use them,26,80
995,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,as the title indicates this a pretty colorful case at a very reasonable price it is the same iphone case you pay 25 30 for at the att store for less than half the price the only cons to these cases is the fit and finish the halves of the case sometimes do not fit properly and the tabs tend to snap off mine did the first time i put it on my phone,73,81
996,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love the case fits super well i wish that i had bought it sooner study and beautiful all of the buttons and camera are fully accessible,27,82
997,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i really like my ifrogz case i can slide it in my pocket since the cover has a smooth surface and it looks sharp too what a great value for a great product,34,83
998,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,I have had my iphone 3gs for about a year only wish i found this case sooner my previous case did not hold up very well and for 4 months I have been sans protection being a cheapskate at times i just could not bring myself to spend 25 or more for a case especially when i was fairing okay with a naked iphone anyways installation was literally a snap i found it to be well designed slim yet rugged enough for the everyday use my phone endures since i do not work outdoors and have only dropped my phone once i did not feel the need for a bulky case like the otter the screen protector is actually one of the better ones I have used fits neatly applies very easily and accurately and most importantly has not impacted my touchscreen use function at all i bought two of these cases my wifes only complaint is it feels a little too smooth and she has afraid she will drop her phone i think the case has enough texture soft velvet feel to stay easily in my grip yet not too much texture to stick to my clothes when i retrieve from my pocket update after 75 days of using the product if you carry your phone in a purse or set it down on a lot of hard rough surfaces thecoating starts to wear off and you see bits of shiny under it not a big deal but thought i would share for the price i would recommend buying a few units and swapping out every 4 6 months,276,84
999,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,very nice looking case got several compliments unfortunately i was only able to show it off for two days before the small plastic connector that links the two separate piece broke cheap price but i guess you get what you pay for,42,85
1000,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,it broke even although i am a delicate handler after that it was completely useless,15,86
1001,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,I have tried many covers before but this one works great it has a kind of soft texture that makes it feel great in your hand i am thinking of buying another just in case i happen to drop my phone and break the case,44,87
1002,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this case broke the first week i had it the thin part of the case on the upper left side by the buttons cracked then totally came apart i had not dropped it or mishandled it save your money and buy something else,42,88
1003,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i have had other iphone covers and the ifrogs has been the best it protects the phone and it also has a protector on the inside that away it keeps from scratching your iphone when taking it off and on,40,89
1004,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i have to take my phone out of the case to charge / play music so i need to remove the phone from the case at least once a day after about two weeks a side tab on the bottom piece broke off for the money I am not surprised if you do not need to remove the case frequently I am sure the case is a decent value just a word of caution if your habits require you to take the case off and put it on frequently,84,90
1005,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,everything worked as expected i would buy it again if i need another one,14,91
1006,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i bought thisfor 10 and i do not regret it is now available for very cheap buy it before they hike the prices,24,92
1007,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i actually got this case at a local retailer after purchase i checked it out on amazon and found that several people had problems with either the case scratching the phone or the case itself such as peeling orproblems i waited about 3 weeks and have not experienced any of those problems in fact the case still looks pretty much brand new i am not too hard on things but am not really careful either anyway what i really love about this case is that it fits the phone so perfectly and mine came with a clear face / screen protector meaning that i did not need to buy it separately considering the price of the case many vendors charge just as much just for the screen protector i have the orange / black version and after 3 weeks it still looks great in fact still looks new unless you look very closely then you can see a couple of small scuff marks where i dropped the phone but you do have to look for the marks i have purchased a couple of other cases for my iphone but none of them fit or look as nice in my opinion as this case all things considered the i-frogz case was a much better value than the other cases i purchased lastly the case is designed such that i have not had any problems with docking my iphone to other devices such as my stereo and more in short this case is a great best i have found option for protecting your iphone and at a great price,270,93
1008,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought this last september when i bought my iphone i love theof the case my problem is that they tab broke off on one side after having it probably a month i kept using it but since the side does not sit flat it catches on things when it take it out of my purse or if i have it in my pocket now a piece has chipped off on the side with the missing tab i wish it would have lasted longer now I am going to try a different brand,93,94
1009,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i was happy with this case for a few days looks good fits like a glove but after a while i realize that it was letting a lot of dirt in and the static cling screen was impossible to clean it left a lot of scratches and dings on my iphone i would move on in fact i am now shopping for another case waste of money wish I have not gotten it,73,95
1010,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i bought this case for my iphone 3 g it has good build quality and is durable i bought another knock off case that looked quite similar from a booth at the mall and right away could tell the difference the cheap booth case felt like cheaper plastic and proved itself to be junk when i had it in my bag on a hot day and the paint started to bubble off of it i then went back to the ifrogz luxe case and have been happy and have not experienced the bubbling paint or any other I shall effects that plagued the no name case at t sells these for around 20 so it is definitely a better deal to get them here on amazon,121,96
1011,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i was very disappointed that the bottom of the case on the front is very thin and broke within one week of my purchase the case also does not completely close so the fit is too tight for the iphone 3 g i really like the way it looks i do not like the way it fits,55,97
1012,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case is great pros durable not flimsy the colors are not to loud and bright it is not slippery like some of the others also this case has cloth lining the inside to protect the phone which is another plus cons covers the apple logo on the back of phone makes air bubbles near bottom of screen protector if you have one hard to put onhowever once on it is on it is nice and tight-if you have trouble the a1 accessories customer support team is great they replied to my email in exactly 20 mins with pics to help overall this is a great case and it protects your investment,110,98
1013,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,I am on my second case so far the first one broke after four months and would not really fit back together luckily i could return it back to the at t store where i bought it for a second one but this one is starting to break as well after a few months it does not fit correctly decent protection breaks easilywears off where you hold it i had a red case and after a few months it looked orange,79,99
1014,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,this case is great off the back looks good also but not to be used i purchased 2 off amazon with wear and tear after having it for about 6 months it cracked and then when i took it apart to glue it the tabs broke and stuck to the top part now it can not lock together i am now going to a rubber case my brother has one and it might be a little bulky and have the rubber stickiness but it is still in perfect condition the case and the phone after a year note a family member had the same case break bought them at the same time in the same spot by snagging in her purse bottom lip under the home button it also scratches the back did not matter to me you have been warned like the other reviews that explain this,146,100
1015,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,very nice case for iphone 3gs i love my iphone 3gs for a lot of reasons it is slim lightweight easy to hold so this case let us the iphone be all those things i had an otterbox case that was waaaaay too intense i understand it is a case to protect a very expensive device but really otterbox is a little too intense for me this one is slim but offers really good protection and it looks and feels good too a,80,101
1016,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,when i bought this product i went through the reviews and it was regarded very highly however when i received it i was disappointed with the quality 1 from the beginning the pieces would not fit securely and would easily come out when i pull it out of my pockets 2 after a weeks usage one of the side locks broke 3 allows dust to settle at the back which in due time leaves scratches my recommendation search if you get something better however the only caveat is there is none,89,102
1017,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the case is two pieces and it does not stay securely together there are tabs that tuck from one piece to underneath the other after 1 month they cracked and broke off because it does not stay together constantly causing stress on the tabs i have two friends who bought the same case for their iphones and had the same problem neat looking and feel but does not last do not waste your money,73,103
1018,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,this case is beautiful however mine has already started peeling the rubberized surface and i only purchased it a couple of weeks ago i normally carry my ipod in a leather case so i do not know if that contributed to the peeling problem but I had be curious to know if anyone else has had problems with peeling,57,104
1019,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i really was hoping this would work for me within one week one of the tabs broke off after pulling the phone out of my pocket and the bottom of the case came off now both sides of the bottom portion have pieces broken off i really liked the slim fit and the satiny insides wish it was more durable,60,105
1020,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,nice finish smooth surface allow access to all buttons and connectors but quite difficult to put on the lock in the back does not allow the iphone to lay flat can not put it in a chargingw / it and lower corners push out the screen protection other than that i like it and will buy another when necessary,58,106
1021,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the bottom black rim cracked on the front side of the case there is a small ri about 1/4 that spans the front bottom of the phone leaving about a two inchmy phone got damp one evening and i found thehad bled on the counter not a good value,53,107
1022,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought 2 of these an orange and black case and a red and black case i put the orange one on and the black tabs on the side broke off within a month so i put the red one on and emailed amazon about the orange they promptly replaced it and within a week of having the red one on the tabs broke off of this one also i emailed amazon again and instead of replacing this one i am returning it i just think the small tabs on the sides are to small and fragile that they brake too easily i liked the colors and the feel of the cases just not the design,116,108
1023,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i had this case for two months it cracked where it connects together i never took it out of the case or dropped it,24,109
1024,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,horrible product it is just like other users comment it is more fragile than the phone itself i have never dropped the phone but the side of the case broke in one month one week later the other side broke then the bottom thin bar broke i should research before i bought this when i bought the iphone i should not listen to the at t sales recommendation,67,110
1025,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,nicely styled and functional case my only concern are the rather flimsy plastic tabs on the lower section of the case you need to be careful installing and reinstalling the bottom portion of the case to insure that the plastic tabs are properly position or there is a good chance they may break when you push the bottom half of the case into the top half that being said if you are careful it is not a great problem,79,111
1026,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,both sides of the case cracked where they come together it also comes apart really easily for example every time i take it out of my pocket,26,112
1027,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this case the day i got my new 3gs at first glance i liked it a lot but after the first day the button on the back that is supposed to keep it together no longer worked at all as i pulled my phone from my pocket the case came apart and my phone went for a trip that i did not enjoy while it did protect the phone that was still covered the bottom half got scratched i would not use this case again if it was free also shortly after the button stopped working the little tabs that help hold it together snapped off and the thin plastic piece above the power jack completely broke off,118,113
1028,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the case does a great job of protecting the iphone but if you want something that will last you better look elsewhere after 3 months of normal use the interlocking tabs that lock the two sections of the case together broke the case is now not functional,47,114
1029,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought my red / black case with my iphone and it was put on for me in the store i tried to take it off a few days later to put the screen protector on and it took me close to an hour to get it off it looks like it would be easy to just press the button and pull it off but it is certainly not that simple i definitely struggled with this a few weeks after buying the phone i also noticed that my white designer sunglass case in my purse was tinted pink and realized that the red from my phone was rubbing off onto it on a positive note i dropped my phone in the grocery store a few weeks ago and the case did what it was supposed to do i do love the look of it and have gotten a lot of compliments on it i imagine i will not be able to switch cases or get it off again until i am ready to break the case or get a new phone but if you are not looking to change cases this may work for you,191,115
1030,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i have had this case for nearly 2 months now and love it great price too purchased the exact same thing when i bought my phone except in blue and it broke because i accidentally stepped on it replaced it with this one and it is worked as it should love the boldit has not faded since I have had it and it is been around the block or two and in and out of my pockets,75,116
1031,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i wish i had read these reviews before i bought 2 cases one for me and one for my husband i would have never bought this case kind of a shame because we like the way the case looks but 2 months later with normal wear and tear no droppings both cases are broken the black clips on both cases have broken off my husband has a black iphone and when he took his case off he discovered dirt and lint had scratched the back of his phone what a rip off this case is supposed to protect the phone not damage it do not buy,107,117
1032,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i got two of these cases one green for me and one pink for my wife our iphone 3 g fits nicely into the case feels great when grabbing them it has a look of rubber but the case is actually hard plastic my wife drop her iphone once and the case protects the iphone very well the cons would be that the upper part colored and the lower part black does not snap into each other very well i had to press the lower part very hard to make the upper part lock into position and the case is a little longer than the iphone less than 1 mm so that the iphone would slide a little within the case this does not bother me but the snapping problem is frustrating every time i took out the iphone and put it back in all if you are looking for something to protect the paint of your iphone this is a good choice,159,118
1033,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,it is a very stylish case for iphone fits perfectly well and i strongly recommend this for iphoners,18,119
1034,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,protects phone nice looking slides in and out of pockets easily the only drawback is that it is two pieces and sometimes they slide apart,24,120
1035,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,bought this case along with my iphone about two months ago at first it was okay but about a month later the black clips broke off now parts of the black section itself are starting to break off even although I have never dropped the phone the case also naturally causes the bottom corners of the screen protector to bubble up pretty terrible case if you bought it full price like i foolishly did,73,121
1036,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is a great case i wanted a case that added very little bulk to my iphone this case protects my iphone perfectly the only problem is that is so snug that screen protectors can get pushed off,38,122
1037,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,the new ifrogz cases are junk they do not hold together and the paint wears off them the old ones have none of these problems this provider had the old variety which after two months still looks and acts brandnew I have even dropped the phone a few times with no casulties,50,123
1038,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,very sleek with high utility the red is very vibrant but not the type of finish that attracts fingerprints easy to use and great price,25,124
1039,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this product is simply super i was lookign for a case for my iphone whe i came thru this the desing durability and toughness are just amazing now i do not have to worry about my iphone thanx to ifrogz,35,125
1040,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,we have now been through three of these cases it every one of them the side catches that hold the two pieces together break it would be a decent case otherwise in addition after a month or so the paint begins to fleck and rub off the corners,47,126
1041,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,after shopping around for cases for my new iphone 3gs in september i settled on the red ifrogz luxe case it is definitely nice looking and protective consisting of two parts that clip together and allow access to all of the buttons and ports on the phone unfortunately the good looks and functionality of this case only lasted about a month small pieces of plastic that are supposed to clip the two halves of the case together broke off quite easily and now the case no longer stays on the phone while taking it out of my pocket I have only had the device for a couple of months now and i think I am quite gentle with it never dropping it treating it roughly or excessively removing the case this thing is just not durable it is a shame because it does look nice,143,127
1042,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,at first i was very pleased with the look and fit of this case i have had it about 3 months now and theis starting to chip off the case and the side tab has broken off i am not abusive at all with my phone but the case looks like i have had it for over a year it has openings in all the right places is easy put on and take off it is a good price and looks great at first when typing on the phone the back release button makes it unstable so it rocks a little,103,128
1043,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i picked up this case because there has an orange one nice and because it isstick up just a hair from the glass screen offering some impact protection if it falls flat also the texture keeps it from collecting a lot of lint and whatnot from your pocket the downside is that i replaced it twice in the first two months of ownership the first one started tearing in an upper corner and the second one had a chunk snap off near the clips that slide together thankfully the store where i purchased the case offered a one year warranty at no-cost so they have replaced it for free but already my third one has hadscrape off the back i baby this thing and always keep it in a pocket by itself there has really no excuse for the thing to come apart / break / chip this easily,145,129
1044,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i purchased this case about a month ago and i have already had to buy something different there are two bits that clip together on either side of the case holding the bottom and top together within 2 weeks both of these broke off essentially making this case useless since it will not hold together thehas also faded quite rapidly and scratched off too easily the case itself does not fit flush with the screen and causes the screen protector film to bubble in the bottom corners additionally the felt on the inside has permanently discolored my brand-new white 3gs one of my friends had the same case and experienced all of the same problems i am not rough with my phone and take very good care of it so it you are looking for anything reliable then this is not for you for the price of this absolute piece of rubbish there are many more cases available i suggest you keep looking it is a waste of money and you are going to need to buy something different in a few weeks anyhow,185,130
1045,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case should be standard issue with the iphone best form and function of the 20 cases i have seen installed on the iphone good for 3 or 4 good hard falls on concrete from my 2 year olds hands i recommend it to anybody who wants to keep their phone in original condition,54,131
1046,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i previously used a clear skin on my iphone combined with a pleather sleeve for over a year the sleeve wore out so i decided to try this case out the case itself is a pretty nice rubberized plastic and was a nice tight fit i kept the skin on it for added protection this case comes with a clear screen protector which is pretty necessary since the front is not protected the case comes in 2 pieces bottom and top that are clipped in the back by something that resembles a big button this is the part that adds a little bulk but nothing i would object too much to the only negative i can say about this case is that the rubberized material chips easily i bought the red / black cover and i can see thechipping away at small spots that may contact any loose change or anything else in my pocket I am careful so the chips are not anything big and most people would not notice it for the price and quality of this product overall i am satisfied,184,132
1047,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this cover with my phone at the att store i liked the design of the cover and that there was virtually no lip between the cover and the screen however i really disappointed with this cover heres the main problems i have with it 1 it does not fit over my screen protecter very well one corner of the screen protecter keeps coming up 2 it is leaving marks on my phone when i took the cover off the other day i saw that it had rubbed the red coloring onto my phone luckily this wiped off but i do not like the fact that it is rubbing against the phone 3 this is my biggest problem with the case it does not stay on this case does not lock together and it is constantly coming apart i find that if put my phone in my pocket that when i pull it back up i end up pulling just the case and not the phone what good is a case if it is constantly coming off i do not like this case and would not suggest anyone to buy it i would suggest finding one that either slips over the phone like the gel type covers or one that truly snaps around the phone,210,133
1048,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i bought my ifrogz case for my iphone 3gs in late august 2009 i loved the look glossy red with the matte black lower case it seemed to protect the phone well however about a month after i bought it i noticed that the clip that holds the black and red parts together had broken on one side the phone has never been dropped nor do i just toss it in my pocket it lives in a leather protective belt case last week around the first of november 2009 i noticed that the other side was broken and that the black part had cracked from the side of the round dot that connects it to the red part all the way to the bottom of the case it is now just held together by the sticker on the inside of the case i tend to baby my electronics my iphone replaced a 20 gb ipod photo that still works and looks nearly new so after just over four months i have to say I am not impressed with the way the ifrogz case is made nor with the way it held up i do have to say it is one of the better looking cases on the market and you might get lucky and have it last longer than i did,221,134
1049,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,sure it looks nice the red and blue both great colors thescratches off easily the thin black part has broken the button that clips the two parts together has stopped holding now i often find one part is still in my pocket it lasted a couple months for me but heck if i start putting my 25 away every 2 months i can just keep getting new phones -p,71,135
1050,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i find this to be an excellent product looks great without taking much away from the iphones sleek design gives good protection to the phone without adding much bulk if you want great protection which looks good with less sexy i find the speck products perform very well,48,136
1051,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i paid 2999 for this at the att store at first i absolutely loved it after a couple of weeks the bottom black started to slide down frequently the black part was not interlocking properly after continuous movement the interlocking piece broke i purchased another one and the same thing happened i emailed ifrogz and they were great to send me another one but the same thing happened so three cases same thing I am done maybe it is not made for the gs oh and the scratching thing everyone talked about happened to me too,95,137
1052,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought this case when i got my phone and was pretty happy with it until i took it off to clean my phone the back was scratched and the back of the phone was covered with dead skin and hair it was pretty nasty the bottom of my case broke a few weeks ago and the case was pretty useless after that good case for the first few weeks but now I am going to try a different one,79,138
1053,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,it is a nice case and it looks really good but it broke several times i never dropped it or anything i would just take it out of my pocket and find that it had broken along one of the narrow bits near the volume button or theconnector superglue fixed it the first few times but eventually it broke in two places and a big chunk fell off i emailed ifrogz and they offered to replace it for free but i worry that if i do actually drop it it will not do much to protect the phone i bought a blue one of the same model as a gift at the same time and it is still in one piece so it is possible i got a crummy one judging from the reviews this is common although,136,139
1054,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this case looks works and feels great it has an attractive metallic look to it but a smooth grippy feel and it fits snugly and perfectly on the phone and offers pretty decent bump-protection for such a slim-line case the only negative I have found is wear I have only had the case a few weeks and the edges are starting to show some wear to the finish now i tend to put my case through a bit of wear-and-tear pulling it in and out of my pocket my bag and and a strap case on my bag several times a day but i would have expected the finish on this case to hold up just a bit better than it has all-in-all although it is a great case very attractive and very functional,132,140
1055,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this case because i wanted to purchase a sturdy reliable case for my iphones 3gs this case is terrible it not only let us in dust and dirt that will scratch the back of your phone over time the 2 parts that allow the case to fit together always come apart the plastic that the case is made from is also very brittle it eventually begins to chip away over time thus leaving areas of your phone exposed it is a terrible case and a waste of money,88,141
1056,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this is a great deal the case is stylish and feels comfortable in your hand i owned another case prior and wish i would have bought this one first,29,142
1057,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,this case has a great feel to it it does not add any bulk to your phone but the case opens with just a little pressure for example when i plug in the charger it would open and if i take it out of my pocket at a slight angle it will open also one of the tabs that keeps it closed has broken off i will be buying a different case soon,72,143
1058,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i bought both my wife and i one of these and we had a lot of trouble with the bottom portion coming off if the button on the back had a slightly more definedit would probably stay on on the other hand it did keep both of our phones 1 - 3 g 1 - 3gs well protected and looks nice if only the dang thing would stay on,66,144
1059,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i got the ifrogz case when i purchased my iphone from att i was happy with it for about a week before it started to break like many of the other reviews mine also chipped away the pieces that are suppose to hold the case together broke off and scratched the back of my phone i am extremely careful with my phone but it did take a small fall to the ground 2 days ago about a 2 foot fall and the ifrogz case did absolutely nothing to protect it my iphone screen shattered i took the phone in to att and of course they did nothing besides sending me over to apple apple actually told me my phone broke due to the flimsy ifrogz case and they actually do not sell the case for this very reason it sucks to prove a point the apple guy took his iphone out of his pocket and hit it on the counter 4 - 5 times in a row to show me that a case should absorb impact and protect your phone he also shared his opinion that att should cover the cost to fix my screen since they sold me a faulty product I am still trying to work through that no luck yet not even after getting berated by the att employee in the middle of the store he did not like this,231,145
1060,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i am a huge ifrogz lover so i am never disappointed with any of their products and this one is no exception it is sleek in design and pleasing to the eye very nice and dresses up my iphone nicely thanks ifrogz,41,146
1061,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i have this case for little over 2 months and the front corner between the two colors has come apart i am disappointed this is the first case i have that last me less than a year,37,147
1062,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,exactly same as they sell in at t store but at half the price strongly recommend,15,148
1063,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,with all due respect to the people who said this was easy to put on i just can not get the two halves to fit together right absolutely no accompanying directions and the ifrogz website does not have anything either very frustrating,40,149
1064,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,this case is a complete piece of crap it looks pretty but the plastic is thin and it does not actually fit over the phone i tried to get it to work but the plastic is so flimsy that eventually it just bent it barely stays together even without the phone in it it is absolutely a complete waste of money if you are looking for a case that will actually work snap on and stay on try the inspiretech cases i have one and it works well,86,150
1065,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,1 it is not actually metallic but a cheap plastic with a coating if i thought thewould last maybe but it just feels cheap 2 the hardshell requires you to slide it apart hence the big black button on the back to put the iphone in it this would work great if the case could not be pulled apart with the slightest pressure making keeping the case on the phone an issue i spent way more than amazon is charge on this thing and I am dumping it as soon as possible,88,151
1066,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,i had the case for two weeks before it broke it consists of two separate plastic pieces which never stay connected correctly every time i reached into my pocket they came apart causing me on multiple occasions to drop the phone eventually it broke completely when a tiny plastic piece that holds the two plastic pieces together broke i was able to return it to amazon,66,152
1067,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i love the red and black of the ifrogz luxe case it has a nice feel and grip to it without being at all bulky it allows you to see everything on the phone and keeps it quite safe i have not had any scratches or dust under the case and it is done a great job keeping my iphone in good condition my only issue with the case is that after having it for about six months it is gotten several dings in the red finish i think this is going to be common with any case after months of use so really it is not even a huge deal at this price I am happy to buy another one when this one is looking old and worn i have a few friends who have the ifrogz luxe case for their iphones as well I have seen pink blue and silver in person and the silver seems to hold up best against the chipping and scuffs all in all it is a great case that i have already recommended to friends,175,153
1068,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i got the cover in july right after purchasing the new gs iphone the plasticbelow the home button has broken off on the front side after three months other than this the case was great,37,154
1069,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,I am a bit perplexed by some of the positive reviews of this product i have had my new iphone less than three months and in that time i have had two ifrogz cases being extremely careful and caring of my iphone i noticed the coloring / paint of the ifrogz case began to wear-away after only about one month my hands are never sweaty when handling my phone so I am not sure what would account for such quick wear other than poor construction and/or design my primary issue is with how these products break so very easily the first fell off the arm of my chair about two feet down onto a rug but cracked the corner of the casing completely and so i purchased another one as with the first i noticed how the bottom portion does not slide effortlessly into the top when fitting it onto the iphone the little wedges on either side which appear to be to help guide the black bottom section on break almost immediately i have one friend who repeats the exact same issue the second never did fit completely onto my iphone and again has begun to wear and discolor after only about a month / month and a half this is not a product for the iphone it does not give the phone either protection or a problem-free casing resolution purchase something else until ifrogz begins to offer better quality in their products,238,155
1070,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i bought this case and it fits looks great the only thing is the plastic screen cover develops bubbles and gets filmy but easily wipes off good purchase although,29,156
1071,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,this is the exact same case sold at the a and store for apporximately 3x times more than here it is the best looking case I have seen so far i like it a lot and have no problem recommending it to anyone that said it is not perfect dust and dirt can still get between the case and the phone and you should take it off every few days to clean it off else the dirt gets embedded in the black plastic back of the phone i wonder why apple did not continue to use aluminum like the original iphone also the bottom half of the case comes off fairly easily and the little tabs will break off before long one of mine did in the first week but it does not affect the performance of the case at all,134,157
1072,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i am very satisfied with the ifrogz case for my iphone 3 g and would absolutely purchase another this is a hard she shall case not soft gel-like but it has a smooth almost velvety feel the smooth surface allows the phone to be easily pulled out of my pants pocket without sticking the case is composed of two pieces upper and lower that slide together and form a perfect fit to the iphone 3 g one of the reasons i wanted a case for the iphone was that the phone felt a little to slim in my hand this case adds just enough bulk yet the phone is still sleek and thin,110,158
1073,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,i like this case and have used it about five months i have dropped my iphone a handful of times with no damage last week i dropped my iphone while it was in this case and my screen cracked i am not sure if this case has enough shock absorption i am getting a new iphone and will get a new silicone case for it hopefully with better shock absorption,71,159
1074,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,this is a strong elegant case glides on and fits evenly and snugly some may even feel it fits too snugly the benefit of the snug fit is that helps prevent most dirt from getting under the case to be ground into and scratch the finish of your phone there is also a velvet pad on the inside back of the upper and lower pieces that keeps the case itself from scratching the phone this case is slim enough to fit into a holster and it is matte finish makes it easier to grab and comfortable to hold i can also say from experience the case also protects the phone impacts if dropped while the finish of the case remains pretty durable please note i can say this even after clumsily and most embarrassingly dropping my phone on tile concrete and asphalt the only negative i could see is that this case was nearly impossible to remove initially and is still truly difficult to remove this however is not much of a problem if you do not use ai remove my case only to clean my phone because i use a cable to charge and sync even video cables apple branded and generic composite cables work well with this case i am actually considering buying a second of anotheralso note that generic video cables no longer work with the iphone after os upgrade 30 but that is another review,242,160
1075,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,nice case while it lasts i liked it until the finish started chipping off then little chunks of plastic fell off where the pieces came together finally after 4 months i had to put it in the trash where it belonged i am not a heavy user i never use all my monthly minutes and most of the time my phone was in a zipped pocket of my purse,69,161
1076,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,2.0,negative,the good simply the best fit and texture of any case not too sticky like my solid rubber case but not too slick the bad after 2 weeks the finish silver one started to rub and peel off in various places 1 month after purchase the thin piece of plastic that spans above the charger port broke off 3 months later the top left portion of the case above the volume controls cracked when i pulled it from my pocket i never drop or abuse my phone it usually stays in my desk at work or pocket has potential to be great but uses very poor quality materials,112,162
1077,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,pros this case looks awesome i have the blue and the metallic sheen it has is very cool i wish the whole case was thisinstead of just the top third it has a great feel to it too a slight velvety feel that sits in your hand nicely i also like how a thin strip of the chrome bezel shows through cons 1 the button on the back where the two pieces of the case lock together makes the phone rock when it is sitting on a table making it harder to type and navigate the touch screen 2 on my case the two pieces do not line up exactly when going on the bottom part and the top part do not sit over each other exactly as they should so i have to press one part down with my finger this also seems to prevent the button from locking all the way this issues has not limited the functionality of the case yet but i assume the it will get worse the more i take the case on and off if they offered this case without the button on the back allowing it to sit flat on a table it would be a 5-star plus product,205,163
1078,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i bought this case in may and first the bottom part of the case broke about 2 months back and then the top developed a crack a couple of weeks later i do not throw around the iphone am very careful about handling it have been careful not keeping the phone with sharp objects keys and more in fact the phone is in my pocket book in a separate section so do not know what could have caused the case to break so soon disappointed,84,164
1079,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,i got this case when i bought my iphone and absolutely loved it i thought it was the best case since sliced bread i loved the way it looked and felt after about a month i went a bought one for my husband a few days later my case started falling apart literally pieces of the case just started falling off i am extremely careful with the case have never dropped it and even put it inside a sleeve inside my purse so it does not bang against other objects my husband was the first to notice little pieces chipping off only after a month and i could not believe it i called ifrogz and they agreed to replace the case after about 2 weeks and additional arguing with ifrogz the new case finally arrived but it was defective a piece on the back of the top part of the case that should lie flat is flipped up making it impossible to put it on my iphone and fit together at first i just thought it was fluke and maybe i had gotten a bad case but with the new case that does not work and my husbands new case starting to chip after only a month i am convinced it is a very shoddy product i have wasted 60 and have 2 cases that are terrible one that i can not use and the other beginning to chip what a waste,240,165
1080,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,product exactly as described comes up higher than the screen face allowing you to set the phone screen-side down to prevent accidental damage from falling objects but without sitting on the screen itself easy to get on and off easy to clean grippy surface but without sticking to your clothes when putting in and out of your pocket would highly recommend,61,166
1081,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,i got this cover in april for my new phone absolutely love it very slick thin fits well can access all button and ports i never take it off people ask me how i got a red / black phone it is so thin it does not look like a case very thinon the front does not wrap around and cover half the phone like others do very classy professional looking a mat finish not shiny i have dropped my phone a few times in the 5 months I have had it and the back ring around the button has broken off half of it so it is now a half moon and there is a chunk missing on one side where the 2 pieces come together only taken it off once when i had to take the phone in to be repaired the button on the bottom stopped working from dropping it maybe when i took off the cover 2 little pieces of the case fell out the tabs on either side my phone however was not scratched at all the back and sides are beautifully pristine not a mark or scratch the case is much easier to put on and off although now that the tabs and the ring are broken off still stays on the phone tight no slipping i would like to get another case since this one looks broken i have been searching and do not see any others that are as thin and upscale looking will probably just get another ifrogz in red / black,253,167
1082,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,i love this case it is pretty nobody else has an iphone like mine it is super protection I have dropped this a few times with minor scratches the phone is just fine luckily i put the screen protector on because after the first time being in my pocket with house keys the screen protector is scratched better that than the screen the big draw back I am not actually sure how to get this cover off it is been on since the week i got my iphone the rigidity of the case prevents it from docking in the griffin am / fm radio charger i ended up getting a cheaper uglier version so that it docks okay I am very happy i got it,118,168
1083,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,the issue with the case is that the bottom half and top half do not actually click together so if it is in your pocket and your pants are even moderately form fitting when you pull out your phone half of your case will stay in your pocket not much use of a protective cover if it is not even on the moment you need it pulling the phone out of your pocket is the time that people accidently drop their phone the most it looks really nice but what has the point if it can not stay on,94,169
1084,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,if your looking for a case that keeps you iphone completely protected you just found it easy to put on easy to take off who could ask for anything more,30,170
1359,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,i ordered the black flower phone cover it came quickly however after a week the print started peeling off the hard case i ended up taking the cover off i am super disappointed because i was really excited about it,41,0
1360,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,nice looking case had to make an adjustment to get it on my phone have dropped the phone a few times and it has fallen off,26,1
1361,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,good price and good case but two days after receiving it the case decor started to peel on the bottom,20,2
1362,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,if there has anything rubberized about this i can not see it flimsy cheap plastic comes in two pieces paint easily scrapes off I had say you get what you pay for but once you figure in shipping you can get a solid hard case that will actually protect your phone for the same price or a few bucks more,57,3
1363,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i love this case cover it is durable enough to protect my phone but the design on it makes it a little more girlie than just a plain rubberized case great product,31,4
1364,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,it is thin and looks like crud do not buy this product you will be sorry that u wasted your money,20,5
1365,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i would recommend this case it looks good and is tough i dropped my phone this morning in the garage and despite having landed on a cement floor my phone was fine the case came quickly shipping and handling was great,42,6
1366,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,it has saved my phone from breakage and taken the hit when i dropped my phone reasonably priced as well,20,7
1367,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,the design is nice but the pattern rubbing off already i have only had it on for a short time,20,8
1368,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,product was really nice and it was really a great gift i enjoy getting the product and it was still on time as well thank you,25,9
1369,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,the blossom represents spring and hope for me but the black theme is classy and perfect for the winter months,20,10
1370,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,i bought this case because i like the design first impression cheap flimsy plastic since I am not one to waste money i went ahead and use it it snapped on and fit perfectly and protect my phone well I am happy with it as it slips in and out of my pocket easily and the rubberized feel helps keep it from slipping out of my fingers the problem came when i had to remove the cover there was no way for me to do that without damaging the case a couple hook pieces broke off and the case no longer hold together very well upon removing the cover the first time i noticed a few scratches on my phone from it but the scratches were minor compare from the scratch i got for dropping my phone without any cover so i cover my phone back up some of the blackaround the rim got rubbed off over the year after more than 15 years I am not ready to buy new phone yet but i certainly need a new case because i do not want to start usingtape to hold this 3 case together still i certainly got more than my moneys worth with this case,206,11
1371,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i like this phone cover it came in a reasonable amount of time the price was great i recommend anyone get a case for their phone when they are this cheap,31,12
1372,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,it is not the sturdiest my wife dropped it and the corner clasp broke use some tape for a month till i got her another one but what do you expect for 4 worth the price paid,36,13
1373,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,i liked this when i first got it and was very happy but after awhile it started to fade and in less than 6 months it broke maybe i am too hard on my phone but i was disappointed,39,14
1374,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,i really like the design but it only lasted me a few weeks and i am not rough on phones,20,15
1375,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,when i received the product the design was different kind of an inverse annoying but besides this obvious mistake the case is good kind of a strange texture although it is rather hard to describe but it grips and slides around less,41,16
1376,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,i am very disappointed in thisthe first day i put the case on it never fit correctly the top right corner was missing a piece so i could not click in not happy at all and will not be buying anything like this again,44,17
1377,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,love this case so much it is by far my favorite i love the texture and it stayed in good shape for a long time exactly what i expected no complaints,31,18
1378,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,love theand it was easy to install on phone makes it easy to change out my case from week to week,23,19
1379,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,it fell once and now it will not stay but good for the price so i can not really complain at a bargain,21,20
1380,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,poor qualitychips off easily cover does not seal very well not very happy but it was cheap wouldnt buy a cheap one again,24,21
1381,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,it is good to make your phone look different that is about it one drop and the case is broken at least it was inexpensive,23,22

1383,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,it is a cute case but it was not for a droid incredible 2 it was for a motorola phone so i can not even use it,25,24
1384,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,it is very cute but does not fit right front and back tend to separate does not snap together properly i would not recommend this,22,25
1385,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,i love this case cover it is made of very thin plastic so it does not add any bulk to my phone i was skeptical because of the price but it was well worth the small amount i paid definitely recommend this,41,26
1386,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,from the pictures it looks like it is going to be a classy black and white case however this is not the case th cover also has brown vines which i was not thrilled with as i wanted just a black and white case the case as other viewers mentioned is not study it broke within a couple of months and i do not drop my phone ever the case broke because it was thin and just with every day usage of handling the phone makes the case break i received this as a gift because i asked for it for the holiday season however i was very disappointed,109,27
1387,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,2.0,negative,it looks nice on the phone but it is not really secure it comes off easily price is cheap cheaply made,23,28
1388,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,4.0,positive,i am pleased with my purchase of this case for my droid incredible 2 it is priced very low so there is not much room to complain about anything as with all cases that i see people complain and give low ratings over it feels very flimsy and cheap when you first take it out of the package but it fits the phone well and does not come loose and the design is not fading away or peeling off i also really like that it has a smooth rubberized feel to it the only part that concerned me was when i dropped my phone the case popped right off but then again every case i have ever had does that at some time or another i got it to make my phone look pretty not completely save it from being mishandled,141,29
1389,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,5.0,positive,love this case cover i get compliments all the time on the unique design cover has been great and protects phone well as i have dropped it a few times so no marks scratches,35,30
1390,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,i do not know if it just this type of cover or this particular cover but the first time i dropped it the cover snapped in 1/2 and jacked my phone up the cover itself broke and is no longer usable i wish that i had spent the money on the silicone one to begin with,55,31

1392,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,1.0,negative,this cover is beautiful do not get me wrong but it is a 2-piece cover and the snaps are very flimsy i would not feel comfortable leaving my expensive phone to be protected by this case the plastic is fairly thin you would be better off with another product after all if you are going to spend the on a nice phone I had spring for the few extra dollars for a nicer case the snaps feel like they would break if you removed the case once or twice to clean it I had go with a tougher case,93,33
1393,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004X7VR12,3.0,neutral,i guess you get what you pay for this is a cute case I have had many compliments on the design however the bottom two tabs broke after one slight drop of the phone granted the phone was protected but i do not think it would have broken even without the case the point is the case is not very durable but like i said you get what you pay for,67,34

1412,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Y09MQU,3.0,neutral,it fits too loose behind the ear with the answer button on the side you end up pushing the volumn and answer buttons at the same time answer button should be on the front,34,18

1419,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Y09MQU,1.0,negative,sorry to sound so angry but it is because i am this bluetooth looks nice sturdy dainty and usefull it is everything but most bluetooths have a ear hook that swivels to sit securely over the ear this piece of shit bluetooth cliks back and forth and does not even secure properly around or over the ear it is made poorly and if you want to save yourself the trouble of buying something you absolutely can not use take my advise and buy something else after i purchased this bluetooth i found my old one and threw this shit in the back of my closet since it is no good and i can not get my money back so like i said in the title page do not buy this shit ok I am done have a great day shoppers,136,25
1420,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004Y09MQU,3.0,neutral,this headset is good and inexpensive my only complaint is that it is complicated you have to stand on one foot hold the other behind your back while rubbing your head and having a detailed conversation anyway you get thecomplicated,42,26

1433,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,3.0,neutral,i like this phone but the screen is to small for me and the internet is not very user friendly it makes good calles and is a good looking phone i just did not like using it for the web good back up phone,42,11

1436,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,3.0,neutral,this is a decent phone for someone who only makes calls and texts very little i say text very little because i text all day and the battery does not last by 7 pm i have to plug it in the other issue i have is that the multi media messaging is still locked with at t i am on t-mobile therefore i can receive photos but i can not send any when receiving photos from others i always get the photo at least three times this would be a major issue if i did not have unlimited messaging in my plan i also do not have internet on this phone perks to this phone the call quality is good the earpiece volume goes up pretty loud the setup as far as getting to your contacts or your calendar or whatever it may be seems to be pretty user friendly and this phone does look nice,153,14

1438,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,4.0,positive,it has only been two days since i got the phone so rating this product is a little premature if you have been using a blackberry this phone might frustrate you a little bit the keyboard sticks a little you have to add a period at the end of all sentences instead of the software doing it for you the comma is actually not featured on the keyboard but as a symbol that you have to access from a symbol list having said that all of this is very tolerable the track wheel seems very sturdy but you are better off clicking instead of dialing reception has been really good everywhere i have gone the sound tends to be soft and so are the different rings i like the display overall it seems like a very good but simple smartphone when you buy this article make sure they include a data cable with it it should come with it but it was not packed with my order it is a proprietary samsung design so finding it would be difficult they did not even have it at the at t store best buy or radioshack around where i live i hope this review helps,201,16
1439,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,4.0,positive,this phone is great if you can manage to get one that works i purchased 5 in total but only kept two two worked great the windows based system made getting email and opening msa snap the music feature works great but you do need that micro sd card for storage downside no wifi the defective models had defective charging ports phone lock would not unlock once activated phone menu was not always accessible it is hit or miss with this one most phones were available through unlocked cellphone kings and their customer service is not good they refused to replace one of the phones thank god I had purchased that one using paypal and paypal reimbursed me the seller did not even care i had purchased 5 phones from them bad businesss,131,17
1440,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,1.0,negative,compared to nokia and lg phones this one felt cheap and light back panel to secure battery did not fit battery life was poor no alarm function it was returned,30,18
1441,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,4.0,positive,i wanted an unlocked phone to take to take on a uk trip i used a global sim card which has it is quirks so i had to sift through what were phone issues and what was the sim card issues overall the best attribute is the sound quality of the ear speaker probably the best sound i have ever had including my blackberry pretty easy to use other than larger keys hardly light up and can be very difficult to see in the dark also battery life is not anywhere near what the makers claim i have had worse but keep a charger close by you will need it ear phone plug is samsung only as is the charger not usb overall quality very good nice looking and i would buy one again,134,19

1445,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,4.0,positive,i received the samsung blackjack ii and basically it is a great phone first off the battery would not charge up so the seller sent me a new battery then the battery cover would not stay on so the seller sent me a new one luckily i had ordered a case cover for this phone so the battery cover was not an issue there is no users manual specific to this phone and when i called the seller they said they did not have one and that one could be downloaded via internet however the manual is 167 pages so i have a phone that is not living up to all it is capabilities becuase i do not have a users manual this is a discontinued phone i would caution to only order if you are already very familiar with the specific phone you want as these discontinued phones may not have a users manual the seller was helpful whenever i called and responded right away but they could do nothing about the lack of a users manual i would only order a phone over the internet if i had that particular phone before and still had the owners manual,200,23

1457,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,2.0,negative,this keyboard works as advertised but unfortunately is not full sized and therefore is a pain to type on better than the keyboard on the phone if your going to type much but not worth carrying around if your not anticipating lengthly entries it works but will spend it is life in the back of a drawer,56,2
1458,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,2.0,negative,i had order this product it was made out of a good rubbery flexible product but i must have been defective cuz i would not connect to bluetooth but i was able to return if it was working I had have given it five starts it was great for on the go and since it was like a plastic it was water resistant,61,3

1463,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,this is probably the most worthless keyboard in existence and i am not exaggerating i am not sure if i received a defective one but i should have returned it immediately looking at it it looks cute portable and nice once i actually plugged it in to use it i noticed that there was a very minor buckle in the silicone where it is attached to the battery it made typing nearly impossible everything was total gibberish even without the buckle i can not imagine the keyboard being very good it is simply not worth wasting your time over i have very nimble fingers and am a girl trust me it is not me it is the keyboard,114,8

1466,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,we just kept the keyboard but it was wrongfully advertised it does not work with samsung ativ s phone because the bt stack in the phone does not support the keyboard anyway we find some use of it,38,11

1476,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,although i was extremely excited to get the product i was upset to find that the device does not work with my nook hd the nook recognizes the keyboard but i can not type anything and am still stuck using the touch screen keyboard i am sending it back,49,21
1477,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,i queried amazon database for galaxy sii t-mobile compatible bluetooth headsets ikross products were presented and i ordered / purchased two of thei fully charged each unit prior to attempting to link the headsets to my sii repeating the linking process often on both units yields the message that there are no nearby bluetooth devices found i was sold worthless product,69,22
1478,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,2.0,negative,this keyboard was a waste of my money it did not connect to my phone nor to my tablet i would not recommend thisand to bad i could not get my money back,34,23
1479,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,2.0,negative,the keys are just too small for my hands everything else is flawless on it although makes a great mobile keypad if you can get used to the key size,30,24
1480,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,that is what she said haha this keyboard is too small for you to be able to touch type it may work for some but not for me the buttons all work although and it paired easily with my google nexus 7,41,25
1481,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,this keyboard is nice and works as advertised it is smaller than i had expected i thought it would be just a little smaller than a full size keyboard where i could at least type on it like a normal keyboard the keys are too small to try to use it like a keyboard it has become a hunt and peck keyboard similar to using it on the ipad screen it is just a little too small for me,79,26
1482,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,theof the bluetooth keyboard is a great one but the keyboard is too small to be of use rhe keys ate smaller that on the touch key pad of any phone or device theis a good one but the product falls short of expectations,48,27
1483,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,4.0,positive,it took several tries but i got it to work with my phone an lg rumor touch i bought this to avoid carrying a netbook on an upcoming bicycle tour i like to blog when i tour but do not want the extra weight and bulk of a laptop or netbook and can not really depend on using hotel or library computers this will make it much easier to use the phone even although the phone has it is own keyboard which is just too small for anything but a quick note the instructions that came with the keyboard are less than detailed but it does work the only thing I am not clear on right now is the battery leaving the usb connection plugged in for a few hours apparently charged the battery as the led went out maybe that means it is fully charged the instructions do not say but it works right now so I shall just see how long it works i do not expect to need to use this for more than an hour or so at a time anyway,182,28
1484,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,this product is too small to touch type i really wanted it to work but i do not think anybodies hands would fit on the keys to touch type,28,29
1485,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,I am currently doing some research on it but i recently purchased this keyboard and was wondering about something i have 3 cell phones 1 basic and 2 smartphones i had no problem connecting and using the keyboard to the old basic phone which has bluetooth 12 for my old smartphone i paired it but was prompted with an error message saying paired but not connected the keyboard does not work for this phone which has bluetooth 21 my current smartphone could not connect or pair with it i was prompted with a message saying hid device is not supported on this phone this phone has bluetooth 30 is the ikross keyboard a universal bluetooth keyboard but not working is it limited to only connecting to 1 version of bluetooth or something else i do not know but I had like to know,140,30
1486,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,i bought this product to use with my asus netbook the netbooks can be difficult to use because of their small keyboards i was thinking this product might be the solution this keyboard arrived as advertised it connected quickly with my netbook via the bluetooth dongle i installed however the keyboard is even smaller than the one on my netbook i do not have very large hands but even i had trouble typing on it if the keyboard was a little bigger it would have been a perfect accessory as it is it is just a novel product that did not really meet my needs,102,31
1487,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,this keyboard is nice but it is a little awkward the keys are small and the keypad is very sensitive be careful not to press like you would on a normal keyboard or you will end up with this llllllllllll it connects fine on my android tablet,44,32
1488,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,5.0,positive,i originally bought this to use with my phone as i was just migrating from the physical keyboard of the blackberries i had not anticipated the awkwardness of using a keyboard with the phone meaning that the phone would not or could not be in my hand at the same time plus the keyboard is a little bigger than i thought it would be notwithstanding the product is still awesome and durable it is also splash proof i use it on my phone when it is connected to my monitor but it mostly works with my playstation 3 all in all I am glad i bought it,106,33
1489,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,key board performs as advertised and shipment was prompt it is small but that was the point for it to be small / portable,21,34
1490,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,i love the look of this and it was the only one i could find in silicon that rolls up and is small i wanted a bluetooth keyboard for my iphone that could fit in my purse this would have been perfect except that it does not work it was slow in arriving as well the first one i received would not pair with my iphone the bluetooth-ness of it was not completely working i called the company and they required me to return it and then they sent out another i waited and waited and finally received the new one this one paired and i was really excited but then i started to type only about half the keys work so i give up the company better refund me last time i talked to them they would only issue a replacement and did not seem to want to refund,147,35
1491,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,2.0,negative,thisi bought for my phone that it said would work on it it connected to my phone but it will not work on it it is good for tablets although,31,36
1492,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,1.0,negative,i was excited to purchase this product to take notes during class at university it arrived a day before promised making it seem like an even better deal despite reading other reviews on this product i decided to chance it i opened the package to see it contained a rubberized bluetooth keyboard and about 4 pages of instructions i opened the package and found no usb mini-usb charge cord for the keyboard luckily i had a spare laying around the house once charged admittedly for only approximately a half hour i turned on the keyboard the keyboard was recognized by my samsung galaxy s ii phone and pairing was as simple as following the onscreen instructions and inputting the 6 digit password here is where things went awry the product is small as warned by previous reviewers however i could have been able to work around that i immediately opened quickoffice and created a new word document the bluetooth keyboard only picked up intermittent keystrokes sometimes it would pick up the wrong key entirely i although this may be a problem with quickoffice but when i tried it in a simple text window i had the same results i thought it may have been the result of a low battery so i allowed the keyboard to charge for 4 more hours to my dismay i yielded the same results i am returning this product as defective / not working as advertised it did not work with my samsung galaxy s ii as a previous commenter has noted better luck to anyone who takes a chance on this keyboard i do not recommend this product,272,37
1493,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,2.0,negative,i was very excited when i received the keyboard because it could be rolled-up and fitted into a small tin unfortunately it could not pair with my blackberry torch blackberry playbook toshiba macpro and lenovo laptops my devices and laptops could detect the keyboard but when prompted to key-in passcode to pair the devices the keys on keyboard did not work the instruction on the 4-page manual did not help instructions are almost not related to the product it is does not give proper instructions and there has no helpdesk number to call for assistance there is also no manufacturers website design wise i love it function wise it did not work i returned the product,112,38
1494,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,3.0,neutral,i was really looking forward to receiving this keyboard based on the previous reviews i am deeply dissatisfied the keyboard is simply too small and the caps locck only works when it wants to unless u normally hunt and peck to type this keyboard is not for u to put it in perspecticve the width of keyboard is 3 inches and te lemgth is about 85 inches time to buy a bigger onne,72,39
1495,Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005M1BW2W,5.0,positive,this keyboard is great i use it with my samsung galaxy s ii connection pairing was easy and the keyboard has rubber keys with tactile feed back and the whole thing is weather proof and rolls up small enough to fit in a pocket actually the whole keyboard body is soft rubber except for the battery holder the usb charging cable comes on a spring driven roll up spool and is very small to store and works just like it should i have big fingers and typing anything more than a sentence or so on the s ii keyboard is a real problem with this keyboard nearby i can compose a long document or email just like on a notebook computer i even used it to type this review i really like this keyboard especially for the price,138,40
2166,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,the story was very well written however miss hilda needs her mouth washed out with soap there is a difference between being wicked and being nasty i know it is fantasy but please let us see the nice side of hilly bad witch i did like theof the story if you like this type of story forever neverland is a great read ps bad snow white too only for another reason you need to wonder if price charming ever asked her hey snow you ever notice how much junior looks like sleepy,92,0
2167,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,if you can overlook the lack of proofreading or maybe it is a translation to english problem this is a fun read i even went to his website and downloaded the complete series of hilda the wicked witch series and they are all very good it is interesting to see the writing develop and greatly improve do not do as i did and mix up the sequence do read them in order i would recommend reading snow white first although i guess this is the second in the series although the writing seems to be the start then hilda the wicked witch the challenge then hilda and zelda i look forward to more hilda she has definitely shiny,115,1
2168,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,while this book is no literary masterpiece it certainly kept me entertained which i believe is the authors purpose i love the way he was able to insert different fairytale characters into his book so effortlessly hilda is a great character i do not believe i would call it raunchy at all you could definitely make your own interpretation with regard to the dwarfs and snow white which make the book that much more interesting i can not wait to read his further works also the typos were barely noticeable,97,2
2169,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,obviously not a kids story anymore this is a delightful but wonderfully twisted take on the whole fairy tale setting yes bad language some typos some suggestive and perverted comments all in all a fun read just keep in mind what you are reading,44,3
2170,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,while better than the original hilda it still was not a good book poorly translated to english and to kindle i expect some mistakes in all books i read whether print or e-book but this book was just over the top with too many wrong words glad it was free but still wish i had skipped it altogether,58,4
2171,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,the story is all right the egregious sex is tolerable the writing is only acceptable for a teen-age non-native speaker of english who is vanity-publishing and thus forgoing an editor the book is filled with grammatical errors peculiar word choices and tortured idioms even a spell-checker would have lessened the pain a bit skip this one if you have any fondness for the language,64,5
2172,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,the story itself is kind of cute but oh my god the writing and the lack of editing the sheer volume of typos is astounding to behold please please please get someone to proof your work prior to publishing,37,6
2173,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,hilda is short for hilarious i love her attitude i also loved that boneylegs makes an appearance in this book come on you got to love a witch that lives in a hut with chicken legs i would have given this a 5 but i thought it was a little creepy with the snow white / dwarf thing,55,7
2174,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,hilda the wicked witch is back i loved the first one and enjoyed this one as much that hilda is such a clever clever girl and those dwarfs are hilarious you will find out why they really enjoyed having snow white stay at their cottage mr katers writing is laughing out loud witty he has definitely growing as a writer i recommend this book highly although it is inappropriate for children under the age of 17 it is a fun easy to read twist on a fairytale classic that shall make you look at the snow white story in a whole new way congratulations paul,99,8
2175,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,it took awhile to get through not award winning but cute just okay but it was free if you have time to kill try it out,27,9
2176,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,we downloaded this for our 7 year old not familiar with it big mistake had nothere was language like hate and b tch and now after reading some of these other reviews i am sure there would be more objectionable stuff,42,10
2177,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,good for reading to children they will enjoy it nothing like snow white as we used to know it as children ourselves,23,11
2178,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,what a page turner can not wait to read more books by this author thank you for a exciting take on snowwhite,21,12
2179,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,i am reading this seriese because it is free have a few more to get through the author is an ok writer,22,13
2180,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,this was not the most exciting book I have ever read but it was entertaining i find I am beginning to like hildas outlook on life laughing out loud have only read the first two books so far and liked them both,38,14
2181,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,i read this book on airplane rides and it kept me entertained the story is funny and silly and at times odd but i enjoyed it an easy read,29,15
2182,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,i know i put 5 stars but a little venting first i am an avid terry pratchett fan bordering on obsessive and i am peeved that paul kater would dare suggest that his story is based in discworld he mentions three witches from terry pratchetts world involved in this story and that is absolutely absurd in katers world suck an elf is a common expression and in pratchetts world you do not even say the word elf if you are magical and sucking them would be deadly being in the presence of an elf is deadly in katers world there are socerers and in pratchetts world that is not allowed it is also deadly same with dragons in pratchetts world the big ones do not exist basically pratchett fans would understand only little ones the size of dogs this in not by far the only mistakes the two worlds are completely different and kater made a tremendous mistake here that being said this book is the only one of eight eight so far that even tried this so i guess i will cut him some slack because i did love the stories they are not well written i will agree but the story is great if you have any imagination you can easily forgive the unprofessional writing and enjoy the story many people expect too much from kindle free books this is a venue for amature writers to get their stories published they do not have editors and teams of people working behind them the stories are pure and unedited that is what makes them great this story is from his mind and no one elses and it is a good one i spent two days reading all eight and i would not hesitate to read another even if i have to pay for it enjoy,303,16
2183,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,the most beloved wicked witch ever returns in another volume the language problems that ran rampant in the first installment is still here although it does seem less pronounced and in no way detracts from the great story being told fair warning this is not exactly a fairy tale for kids instead it is gritty unique and at times a bit racy although there is nothing explicit any actual sex is just mentioned in passing,74,17
2184,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,a very entertaining read it would have been apt for older children who have known of the classic snow white but with the not too subtle sexual scenes it is r18 at best it must really be the authors writing style but i really find myself frowning at a lot of redundancies example snow white had eaten and drunk from the food and drink on the table really what else would one do with food and drink another thing and i might have probably missed it did the queen get to realize that snow white was the bride or is the answer in the third book in the series oh well as i mentioned it was very entertaining i really enjoyed it,122,18
2185,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,this book was entertaining for a casual novel the main character was well written and had an attitude that amused me the plot stayed true to the original story with details that spiced up the open spaces do keep in mind that there are mentions of inappropriate behavior even if it is never described graphically however i found the editing to be poorly done there were several spelling errors missing words and poor transitions between scenes i do not believe that whoever wrote edited this really cared about quality work rather just getting the book finished,95,19
2186,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,i downloaded this because a I am broke b i love fairytales and c i have yet to meet an updated fairytale that i could not love at least partially until now this work is absolutely packed with typos terrible syntax and inane dialogue particularly excruciating is the habit the legendary baba yaga has of calling the main character girlfriend and vice-versa like so many other characters the main purpose of baba yaga seems to be to tell hilda how cool and superior she is giving the whole thing the feel of an amateur fan fiction that someone mistook for an original work and published i was also infuriated when the author introduced three terry pratchett characters granny weatherwax nanny ogg and magrat garlick i tried to believe that maybe this was a crossover but when the three highly distinctive characters behaved in opposition to their established modes of behavior and the payoff was once again one of them magrat telling in excruciating detail and with the kind of over-explaining quality exhibited by fifth graders in a creative writing class how cool and superior hilda is while also conveniently identifying hildas favorite characteristics pair these faults with other deliberate features that make my head throb see repeated references to the mean queen awkward inside jokes like king louie who wrote a book about the jungle the removal of power from traditional characters to give to hilda and the over-sexualization of snow white within the frame work of the original story in which she is a child and you are left with a vaguely plagaristic self-aggrandizing pointless piece of schlock that belongs on a fanfiction site not amazon,275,20
2187,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,where do i begin this book is awful i only got it because it was free but now i do not know if i can bring myself to finish it there are tons of errors and bad sentence structure abounds the plot is pretty lame and the author tries in vain to tie it to the original fairy tale but fails miserably i also thought the drunken orgy between snow white and all 7 of the dwarves was in bad taste this book is just lame i did not much care for the first one either but I am a sucker for free books now i can see why it was free,109,21
2188,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,i love hilda she is my new hero hilda is the type of wicked witch who has her own agenda and follows it she is not horribly wicked i found her to be more fun wicked it is an amusing book that answers the question why did 7 strangers let a woman they never met stay on in their house the answer of course is they were horny little men and snow white was not so innocent i know the editing was not always great but look past that it really was an entertaining read,93,22
2189,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,i do not think that I am too far off the mark when i say this is a cheap knockoff of terry pratchett the early chapters of the book read like a piece of discworld fan fiction and the author appropriates by name three of pratchetts characters in one scene and i think that katers writing has more in common with fanfic than any other genre it is highly derivative and the writing is stilted and choppy the writer also resorts to fanfic trick of making previously known characters more profane or promiscuous as opposed to some creative twist on them finally the text does not appear to have undergone even the most rudimentary editing which means there are abrupt shifts in tense misspellings and grammatical errors galore sure it is a free download but you will still have to spend time reading the thing you would be much better served by picking up the real thing in the form of a novel by terry pratchett say wyrd sisters or reaper man or tom holt snow white and the seven samurai,175,23
2190,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,thefor this book is wonderful sadly the results do not live up to the promise the grammar is atrocious the tense ridiculously inconsistent the humor heavy-handed and the editing severely lacking someday paul kater may well be an excellent writer certainly he has the creativity he just lacks the skill i felt like i was reading a novel written by a twelve-year-old with a dirty mind,67,24
2191,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,well she has back this is one of the most likeable witches to be sooo mean she reminds me of alexis from dynasty i can not wait for further adventures of hilda the stories are captivating and fun i like that she is not excessively cruel but just to thein this book she comes to the aide of snow white simply because she does not like the wickedmother she has a talking house with an attitude a taste for unusual sleepwear and a twisted sense of humor i do recommend this book to anyone that likes to read a good story with fun characters i believe that mr paul kater has stumbled upon the right combination of storytelling and writing skills i know that i want to see more of hilda,132,25
2192,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,this book seemed as although it would a fairy tale written from another point of view similar to the books written by gregory maguire not even close it became quickly apparent that the author was not a native english speaker or the work had been poorly translated that was the first distraction the second and fatal distraction was a lack of development in both characters and plot lines hilda has jarring quirks of language shiny cool puppies that while commented on by other characters is never brought to fruition or given an explanation snow white turns out not to be so snow white after all but no discussion of why or how this came to be is ever bantered about other sub-plots are also left undeveloped who are the broom sellers and why exactly are they so intent on exacting revenge on hilda who in time-honored wicked witch fashion merely did not want to buy a broom the witches annual meeting on scary mountain a name brimming with lack of imagination seems so important but why what is causing the undercurrent of suspicion and dislike among the witches who are these witches and what do they bring to the tale and why oh why is rumplestiltskin there why is the house fixated on being painted the dwarves are unhappy with one another the king is a milquetoast the wicked stepmother is a bumbler but never do we learn any more other than these surface details there is never a reason to feel invested in any of the characters and therefore the story itself one dimensional characters subplots with no context and a strained use of language made for a disappointment from what promised to be and could have been a fun and thought provoking twist on an old fairy tale,300,26
2193,Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,i enjoyed reading the short tale because there were some funny moments i thought the foul language was not necessary and the portrayal of snow white as a hoe was un-expected however i did enjoy seeing it from hildas point of view,42,27
2312,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,i really enjoyed this book the characters were very vivid the plot was interesting but not so complicated that i lost track of what was going on this is not the most historically accurate highland romance that i have ever read but it was a lot of fun lachlan macrae is one of my favorite heroes i hope that he is in the other books recommended,65,0
2313,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,this book has potential but does not deliver the story line is good characters are fairly well developed but there are numerous repeated phases and grammar / spelling errors also love scenes are unrealistic and boringly repetitive,34,1
2314,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i do not usually leave reviews but i wanted to mention what a huge improvement the second edition of this book is over the first the author finally did an edit and cut out several of the non-essential sex scenes with this newer and more professional version it makes it easier to appreciate the plot and characters who were somewhat buried before,61,2
2315,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i loved this story it was moving and had a little bit of everything but oh my god i could not believe this was released to the public without editting seriously what 10 year old let this pass their desk without serious red penciling there was not 1 sentence that did not have an error of some kind and make up your mind is it muira or muria appalling that said this would have never passed with a d in composition writing class due to the extensive errors but i did like the story and on that merit alone i gave it 4 stars because i could not reward a 5 due to the lack of edit read the next in the series although another lifetime still had some errors-but by far better in that department although not in content it takes place 30 years later shorter at 229 in comparison to the 564 pages of this book but worth the read,156,3
2316,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,1.0,negative,i almost never write a review however i felt compelled to do so with this book the sex scenes are raunchy and all but one of them are f scenes without any emotional depth whatsoever just do it fast and hard the dialogue was modern and american rather than old fashioned and scottish the grammar had many issues parallel structure improper word choice punctuation and tense the book lacked consistency in it is setting it was impossible to tell what period of time the book was set in there were references which made the setting seem to be in one period recent fighting with england but then this is contradicted by references to whalebone corsets bonbons and hot house flowers i have trouble imagining a small scottish village having a hot house fine gown maker and fine jeweler in a time when scotland had recently been embroiled in english battles additionally the tanists former mistress portrayed in the book was not typical of the place described a rich mans who are described as wearing fine jewelry in excessive amounts and having a fair amount of control in the lairds castle she sounded more like a woman from regency england the plot was okay but had many cliches even free this book is not worth your time or money,220,4
2317,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,2.0,negative,the story itself was good and i would give it more stars if it were not for 2 things 1 it is unfortunate that every five pages there is a lengthy and extremely explicit sex scene i suppose that is what some people want but i honestly believe that a good romance should be able to stand on it is own without the sexual play by play skipping through all of the sex scenes probably cut out a third of the book 2 this book is badly in need of an editing job there are so many typos i can not believe it was published like that,100,5
2318,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,i really enjoy this genre and the story is a good one the one negative thing is that there are a lot of typos definitely in need of an edit,30,6
2319,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,this is a looooong book but it was such a fun quick read that i did not notice it until i got to the end lachlan macrae is such a dreamy hero i do not know how historically accurate the kilts were okay i do know and they totally are not but it was fun to think about those kilts definitely made for easy access for some of the books racier moments and there were several of those lachlan and muira seem very well matched contrived conflict between two main characters is my pet peeve but this book managed to avoid that flaw this was a very enjoyable read I am definitely looking forward to reading more by this author,116,7
2320,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,as soon as i finished reading this book i checked to see if there was a sequel i was very pleased to discover that that this is the first novel in a series seven books so far although there are a few formatting / editing errors which seems to come with the territory of self-published books the presentation was quite professional and easy to read the story itself was delightful although some of the twists and turns ex a forced marriage are common in romance novel plots the well-drawn characters made it seem fresh and fun there are a lot of love scenes in this book i was not expecting it to be quite so steamy but that is not a complaint the scenes seemed organic to the story and were more romantic than hot overall this was a great book i have already bought the next one,144,8
2321,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,5.0,positive,it came on a kindle how much more can you say about it la alall lal al ala ala ala,20,9
2322,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,1.0,negative,good grief muira is crying throughout this whole book i did a search for sob in the book-six pages of muira crying in the search get a backbone woman and lachlan thinks she is brave and strong she can not lie well but she certainly does it a lot this sat on my kindle so long i forgot what it was about and finally opened it and read it i had to force myself to finish it was that bad i had forgotten the names of the hero / heroine by the next day everyone went from one end of the emotional scale to the other in the blink of an eye definitely a bunch of bipolar people running around had promise never delivered,121,10
2323,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,1.0,negative,i had read the other comments and they did say that the story was good i just could not get over how the whole thing started with the lie perpetuated by the stupid heroine she just stood there and lied by omission so i was not impressed by the heroine from the beginning of the story then the flavour of the whole story was just too contemporary american for me this was supposed to be historical scotland this is supposed to have been a second edition but it needs another round of editing and i could not understand how one dapped for a kiss i did not think there was such a word but I have just checked and it means 1 to fish by letting the bait fall lightly on the water 2 to dip lightly or suddenly into water the bird dapped for the fish 3 to bounce or skip as on the surface of a body of water the stone dapped along the surface of the pond read more dap meaning and definitions nowhere does it relate to the act of kissing anyway i tried to finish it and i gave up after her failed attempt of leaving his place on foot told you she was not smart i have no yearning to find out about what happened to lachlan and muira,220,11
2324,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i really enjoyed this story it was a good page turner i loved the characters and the editing issues did not bother me either i especially liked how the hero protected the heroin throug out the story his honor he held proudly and i really enjoyed that about him he let her family believe the worst and endured it until the end i can not say too much about the details because i do not want to give the story away enjoy this book because i did,84,12
2325,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,the storys theme and characters are great but the editing is atrocious and made it a bit difficult to read at time many many many errors in writing,28,13
2326,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,2.0,negative,i have tremendous respect for anyone who can write a interesting story and i did enjoy this story but i could not get past all the mistakes i spent twice the amount of time reading this book because i had to keep rereading and trying to make sense out of so many sentences i have to wonder if the author has taken the time to reread her own work i understand this is a second version but i this book still needs another round of editing the author has a good story and likable characters but this book just is not ready to go public,103,14
2327,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,4.0,positive,i downloaded the original version of this story before the final editing and before some of the lustier scenes were reworked there were typos missing words in that first version but i did not let it bother me it was a free title after all i knew what she meant even if the words were not always there the story itself was way too capitivating for me to care one little whit about a missing verb now and then this is a beautiful story mesmerizing even it is got everything that a wonderful historical romance should have a beautiful strong-willed heroine a strong powerful hero conflict tragedy triumph and finally a love so true that nothing can get in it is way what more can you want laird mcrae alone is worth reading this book oh my goodness be sure to continue with ewans story a year and a day,148,15
2328,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,the story was really good but the book needs some massive editing i do not mean sentences and paragraphs i mean spelling grammar tensesused no instead of know just as i would get into the storyline a mistake would pop up and bring me back to high school english class i did love the story although and hope to see more from this author,65,16
2329,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,2.0,negative,i so wanted to like this book because i thoroughly enjoy the time period setting and more however the old adage you get what you pay for definitely rings true-it was a freebie i could not get past 11 struggling to see if it got any better i got to the first sex scene notice i did not say love and the dialogue ended it for me too modern not scottish enough an historical romance should be able to stand on it is own without a generous sprinkling of the f word i see from the reviews that after i purchased it an actual editor was used the fact it was put out for the public before the editing nightmare that i began reading completely turned me off i did give it an extra star for the beautiful cover,135,17
2330,Kindle_Store,B008A89P82,3.0,neutral,a romance set in the past two rival clans brought together by a young couple who learn to love each other even although their love is based on a lie also a traitor in their midst nearly causes outright war this could have been a great novel except for the fact there is not much substance and so much more could have been written about the clans instead the author is mesmerised by the couple with page after page of their erotic lovemaking which eventually becomes banal as nothing is left to the imagination i skipped loads of pages to find the story but sadly was disappointed nothing was there,110,18
2401,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i like everything about this game except for the fact that i have to pick a category i think it should be completely open to anything also it is weird in the very hard category i had the word possible but at the medium level i had crazy 12-letter words that I had never heard of either way it is still a great way to pass time and i can play it with my daughters which is nice,75,0
2402,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,it seems to not show the somplete word when you guess the last letter it jumps to the next puzzle,21,1
2403,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i like the different levels and that you can get hints if you need help on harder words there seems to be many words in each category i recommend it,30,2
2404,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,purchased for my 7 year old nephew who is better at this game than i am we tried the easy version and liked the hints feature good for both kids and adults to exercise the brain,36,3

2420,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,there is not a lot of variety in the words that you guess also it has some problems like not responding or clicking the wrong letter i will give it that it is something to do if you are bored and it is good at that overall it is ok and i would reccomend it definitely if it was free responded more quickly and had more variety but if those things do not bother you then i would get it,80,19
2421,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the program should have more words to choose from and less repetition other than that i actually enjoyed the game easy to use,23,20

2423,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i use this when i tutor children teaching them to spell,11,22
2424,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,the game works exactly as one would expect the only problem is the number of guesses allowed although I am very good at word games i have yet to succeed even once with this game a major improvement would be to make the number of guesses allowed adjustable that would of course mean that the hangman image would be broken into more pieces,62,23
2425,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this game is pretty fun but it does cheat like on very hard i thought the word was gorilla but the word was zorilla what the at is a zorilla pretty fun to play but it cheats so i think it should only get three stars and they should make it free so people dowaste money on a game that cheats,61,24

2428,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i was very disappointed in this game in my opinion it is not like the real hangman game on paper at all the original hangman game allows the players to interact by giving clues to the guesser this game does not give clues regarding the word other than giving one letter to the guesser how boring in addition it is virtually impossible to guess the word without asking for a clue which ends up being a letter and defeats the whole spirit of the game also the words that are to be found are very unusual which makes the guessing even harder there is not challenge in this game there is only frustration i want my 99cents back,116,27
2429,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,the categories are incorrectly named under animals they have fish same with veggies and more,14,28

2431,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,it is okay but it gets dull because it has no add-inns like timers and it is always single words the first time i played it itsaid the same word twice in a row it was worth the price because my little brother nathaniel bought it or else it would not have been i do not have anything else to right so bye,59,30
2432,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i was very pleased to see this game available on my kindle the easy puzzels are very easy and do get harder as you choose which level you wish to play i do look forward to other games like wheel of fortune which came from hangman plus added attractions that will give us more challenges games come with easy to follow instructions for those not familiar with game and like earlier said different levels of difficulty,76,31
2433,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,this game sucks it is no fun and the words are random what ever you do do not by this game,20,32

2483,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i am not with it enough to get many of the words without looking for vowels by going thru the tips,21,82
2484,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this game is like what we played growing up in school it was very much like that and a lot of fun as i recall,25,83

2487,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i like this for a simple fun game you are able to pick from 5 levels of easiest to hardest it is divided into many topical categories and for the cost it is a great bargan the fun will last forever i think,41,86
2488,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this is a good game to encourage your 1st-3rd grade children to play to improve their reading and spelling skills,20,87
2489,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is boring i play games with my kindle but not this one anymore the three strikes and you are out kind of ruin the game,25,88
2490,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this is what i do not like about the game it does not let you see the last play meaning if i did not solve the word it does not show me the last screen it immediately goes to a screen that states that i did not win the game the same thing applies when i solve the word it does not show word but it immediately goes to another screen stating that i solved the word this aspect of the game totally frustrates me i do love hangman but not this version,91,89
2491,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,easy to play since the rules are pretty basic it is a good time waster even at extra hard the words are not that difficult,25,90
2492,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,I am a puzzle and word person so i thought I had like this game however even although i rapidly got to the hardest level the answers were all too obvious how about some really challenging words with more than 5 letters teach me,42,91
2493,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i enjoy the game hangman i wish that it kept a tally or score of games in a row that i win,22,92
2494,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,my daughter and i play this game together she enjoys it as much as i do great bonding time thank you,21,93
2495,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,okay to kill some time but lacking in something no score no timer words seemed not to be catergorized very well,21,94
2496,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this was a really fun game when i first got this but finally deleted because got very boring sorry to say that,22,95
2497,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,it is ok for the low price but gets a bit boring it seems to only do single words it would be better with phrases and quotes may be better suited for children,32,96
2498,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,my younger grandchildren enjoy it i find it rather boring i might not have used a more challenging level however,20,97
2499,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,a nice version of basic word game challenge we all learned as a kid a good way to keep brain challenged,22,98
2500,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i love playing hangman but this version is just too easy even set on the most difficult setting maybe it is supposed to be just for kids elementary students if they ever come out with an adult version that would be great,41,99
2501,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is okay i guess i just did not like it it was not the game i remember as a kid,20,100
2502,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,honestly i did not like it this is coming from a 11 year old that is me it was boring and with the colorless kindle kindle touch you would get very bored please do not buy this i highly recommend not to buy it,42,101
2503,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,played this with our 9 year old grandson and he was a little frustrated with trying to come up with the right word may be that we were not on the same track as the creator,36,102
2504,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,not very challenging this is a very good game just to do so you do not have to interact when in a group of people,25,103
2505,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,sorry but this game is lame it involves too much guessing and it oftens repeats several words within the same session,21,104
2506,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this is just like regular hangman but not fun at all it gives me levels to do i do not want levels than it repeats the same word i hate it no onder it was so cheap it is useless i do not recomend to anyone,45,105
2507,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,sometimes too difficult but a great way to waste a bit of time and keep the mind active i would recommend it to others,24,106
2508,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,this game does not hold my interest i was bored with this game in a big hurry and i am a fan of word games,24,107
2509,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,a fun activity when you are stuck in a line or waiting in the doctors office adults and children can play and you have a feeling of accomplishment because it is not too easy,34,108
2510,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i have not had this long enough to give it a thorough review upon first usage of it i was not really impressed but that opinion could change with more use there were some really strange words so it might just be me,43,109
2511,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this game would be good for kids ages 6 and up this game is alright for both kids and adults,20,110
2512,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this game is fun we used to play this on long travel trips with the family the only thing is it does not display the winning word after you get it like it does when you lose it is nice to see the finished word,44,111
2513,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i was very disapointed with this game i tried all the leavles but still did not enjoy playing it at all,21,112
2514,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,helps pass the time and keeps your mind sharp good to have anytime you are waiting for anything or anyone,20,113
2515,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,got husband a kindle for fathers day and he is loading it up with some games too kids are loving it,20,114
2516,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is not what i expected i can not put my finger on what exactly maybe the categories and the items in each one like in the veggie category most are vegetables I have never heard of ever i like a challenge as much as the next person but i like to win sometimes too,52,115
2517,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,it is a nice layout of the game with a lot of choices my 8 year old granddaughter enjoys playing too,20,116
2518,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i really liked the game hangman it is a challenge but a good one it has many different levels for all ages to play,24,117
2519,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i really like it the only thing is that i wish it had longer words to solve and more catagories to choose from,23,118
2520,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this game is really fun i can spend a lot of time playing this i really like all of the different categories the easy mode could be a little harder as all of the words were only 3 letters long i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves to play brain games and loves guessing games,58,119
2521,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,my granddaughter and i played in the car when we went on vacation kept us busy all the way to the black hills,23,120
2522,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,seriously what is up with the design it is downright ugly and way too complicated for my kindle it has to refresh the screen every time i hit wrong because the hanged man is too large to just refresh on it is own i thought it was going to be simple and fun like every word or the grid i would not reccomend this to anyone who has the ability to see the kindle screen but if you want a hangman game that will torture your eyes and the kindle screen go ahead and waste a dollar,95,121
2523,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i bought it assuming i would need it to help pass the time away the only fun i have with this game is seeing how derpy the guy looks whenever i get a letter wrong,35,122
2524,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,this is a good learning experience I have learned a lot not five stars because maybe less fun than expected only five levels 6 subjects and different words on each one,30,123
2525,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,this game can be used to pass time mindlessly the hint just gives the missing letters not what i was expecting there some of the category answers do not make sense eg bugs in the animal category a bug is an insect not an animal otherwise it was easy to use and maneuver thru,52,124
2526,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the game is good for what it is i suppose but they could definately have made it better atleast it does work on my kindle paperwhite as expected making it worth the purchase price,34,125
2527,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i like to play hangman but having a face on the man is creepy also i think when you get the word correct the word should appear written correctly before the word completely disappears and the game tells you it is right this makes it seem kind of cut rate to me thirdly the letters do not always clear when you press them sometimes you have to press a letter several times for it to register at times i have had the same word come up with only one word between and lastly it would help to have the used incorrect letters showing along the side of the picture,109,126
2528,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i have always liked the hangman game as a kid and now even more as an adult i too like the challenge of the game,25,127
2529,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i did not like this game as well as i thought i would i got bored with it quickly probably just me,22,128
2530,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,all children learn this game fosters competition love of words and most important spelling correctly play alone or with another pairing up fun with learning is the name of the game,31,129
2531,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i always enjoy playing word games i had hoped this game would be a little more of a challenge to play,21,130
2532,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this is not what i expected some words need to be longer and maybe hints provided and also meanings of obscure words after solving,24,131
2533,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the easy ones are too easy and the hard ones really get you thinking fun to watch the man complete and incomplete,22,132
2534,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,after playing a great game like every word i find the game very boring very easy level is more difficult than very hard glad it was only 99 cents,29,133
2535,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is too simplistic it does not maintain or hold the players attention i occasionally play it usually only for a few minutes i would not recommend it,28,134
2536,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,play when i not at work or on the train to keep me business thank you very much this great,20,135
2537,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,sometimes difficult even in easy mode other than that i enjoyed it i would recommend to hangman fans a bit hard but still fun,24,136
2538,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i have always loved playing hangman since i was a child i now play hangman with my granddaughter who is six so it was a no brainer to purchase this game i have played it with my granddaughter and she loves it too i like the many levels from very easy to challenging the hangman graphics are great and it is fun to see the progression of the hangman my granddaughter loves to play board games with me and this is another game we can play together with the added excitement for her that she can play it on my kindle either with me or by herself,106,137
2539,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the categories for words are pretty vague and I had prefer more of a marathon format allow you to do 5 words at once or maybe 10 or 20 from each category and then give you a score before the game over sign pops up an overall score option would help make it feel less like that is it when you finish a word,63,138
2540,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the categories are not sharply defined enough and i feel like giving more than one word in a row would make this more entertaining give us the option to do a 5 word or 10 word block and see how we do,42,139
2541,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i love this game for myself but it is teaching my granddaughter how to figure out the word and it is spelling on the very easy and easy she is a first grader I am so proud,35,140
2542,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i used to love to play this game as kids this is great for my brain workout lots of games and levels,23,141
2543,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,fun but the difficulties are a little messed up but still quite fun my 12 year od son loves it recomend it to hangman lovers,25,142
2544,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,this is a great game i enjoy playing games like this the game is a great way to exercise your brain,21,143
2545,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,answers to some categories do not fit the theme such as how does mug fit under vegetables also some answers are duplicated,22,144
2546,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i have not been stumped yet even when i try hard it is rare that i do not guess the answer,21,145
2547,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,it is alright it just was not what i expected it to be i still play it occasionally but not much,21,146
2548,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i guess i just do not like hangman i originally bought this game because i like the wheel of fortune and the description of wheel of fortune is that it is like hangman this is not close enough although but if you like hangman this is a great game haha,49,147
2549,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,gwen senior citizen 69 years of age i love the game of hangman because as a senior citizen it helps with my memory and it brings back younger days of my life with my children when we played hangman together it is a great game enjoy it immensely,48,148
2550,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,do not really care for this game it is ok but just not that great but that is just me others might really like it,22,149
2551,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,the game is a complete waste of time and money the words are short and the words are the same there is no fun to this game waste i say wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaasssssssstttttteeeeedo not buy this game,34,150
2552,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,it would be so simple to make this game pretty decent there are 2 major problems 1 when you finally solve the word puzzle and put in the last letter it does not show you the word it immediately says you won but you do not get to see the word it is especially a pain if the last 2 letters in the word are the same it will catch you by surprise as it blocks you from seeing it and now you do not know what the word was 2 it repeats the same words too frequently i played this for less than 15 minutes and it was already repeating the same words in the category pathetic you are better off throwing your 1 purchase in the toilet it is more fun watching it going down the drain than to play this game,141,151
2553,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,wish the letters were a bit larger and easier to read but fun to play anyway I have always loved to play hangman,22,152
2554,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i thought this would be more of a time killer or at least last a little longer it is full of short words and there is not much difference between the easy and hard words,35,153
2555,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i would like to have a view of my answer right or wrong and the letters from which I have selected before the rather large pop-up at the end covers everything that pop-up is annoying can you downsize it,38,154
2556,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,I have played other hangman games and thought they were ok what makes this one stand tall are the various selectable levels they are not as easy as you may think the easy level is probably the hardest to master you will see i have been enjoying this more than any of the others the only reason it did not get 5 stars is the low quality of graphics it is a word game not a picture game you will be happy you bought it,82,155
2557,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,my son recently got a kindle 20 and found this game he absolutely loves it so glad we found it,20,156
2558,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i would like more options also the harder levels are actually easier since they have longer words with more letters so you can guess them easier go figure,28,157
2559,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i love it alot may be better if i could chuse a word better then always ha ga ja maaaaaa,20,158
2560,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,it is ok i wish the letters were bigger because they do not use all the screen but it is a nice change from other word puzzle games,25,159
2561,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,too simple no clues except categories which are v-e-r-y broad could offer african animals for example instead of the entire animal kingdom,21,160
2562,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,this is a fun game with lots of levels to keep it interesting it entertains all of my children who range in age from 9 to 16,27,161
2563,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the game works okay you can gets clues to start the word manipulating the letters is good enough the bad thing is that when you win the rectangle saying you have won pops out and covers your word before you get to see it only solution is to take your time on the last letter and absorb what the result will be because you will never see the word you have created that seems to have won,72,162
2564,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,we have only played it on easy so i am not sure how tuff it gets my 7 year old plays it most it was his purchase,27,163
2565,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i bought this game for my grandchildren 6years old even the very easy are not so easy and once answer is found the same word is repeated over and over should use more common words,34,164
2566,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,we have not quite conqured this one yet but we are working on it we only have 1 kindel but my husband might have to buy one our kid got me this one for christmas,36,165
2567,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i bought this for my grandsons to play they seem to like it better than i do i think it would be better if the game would show the last letter for the word that solves it instead the screen disappears quickly and in bery small letters indicates that you won and what the word was it would be better for kids if they could see their last letter appearing in the complete word,74,166
2568,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,i enjoy this game but i need to be in the right mood i would prefer more categories from which to choose,22,167
2569,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,it is pretty lame it has to be hard to mess up a game like hangman but they managed the very hard section contained the word cucumber enough said,27,168

2571,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i choose hangman because as a child i had fun with it this one is entertaining my grandchildren love it,20,170
2572,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,the game is good overall the only criticism i have is that when we used the foods and vegetables category some of the answers were ways that food could be cooked for example smoked to me that is not a food or vegetable and that was misleading other than that the game proved to be a great distraction on a long car trip it is worth the 99 cents,68,171
2573,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,it is quick easy to operate and fun i can quickly play a game or two while waiting for something or someone,21,172
2574,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,my 11 year old loves to play this on the bus or in the car while we are in between activities,21,173
2575,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i play this game every now and then not one of my favorites it is not like the hangman i remember this is a little different and a little confusing to play so i never win whether it is in the easy or hard mode should not have bought this one,48,174
2576,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i thought this was one of the worst games i have downloaded i tried to play but finally deleted it off my kindle,23,175
2577,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i have always loved hangman on paper so i immidiatly purchased this game in hopes of a fun challenging game what i got was the exact oppisite do not waste your money if you are looking for a good game get blackjack which is free you get what i mean do not get hangman,53,176
2578,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i had hoped for a good hangman game when i got this but that was not the case first the guy you are hanging looks really stupid also you are hung after fewer missed letters than the classic game another weird thing is the words in the category are not always in the category that they should be and it frequently repeats words i would return it but it did give me a hangman game but it is definitely the lcd if i could go back to before i bought this i would not have made the purchase,98,177
2579,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,i think that hangman is a little bad because you only get hard words i really do not like this game,21,178
2580,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this is a basic hangman game with a really ugly character that is hanged simple game with no bells and whistles,20,179
2581,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,did not impress me at all did not challenge me or interest me and i like word games a lot sorry do not bother,21,180
2582,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,if you were looking for the original hangman this is not it for those who played long ago looking for the older version you will be dissapointed,27,181
2583,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,i do not like playing hangman on paper but the kindle version is very boring i deleted it kindle is great for some card games and word games,27,182
2584,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i use this game when i have to wait at the doctors office for example it has stumped me many times the only thing i would change is that i get to see the answer before it says you won,41,183
2585,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,while i have played this game as a child i thought it would be something fun for my nieces and nephews it does not work well at all and it includes in animals things like lice and moths which makes no sense to me,44,184
2586,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the game is definitely geared for kids the easy words are just short and the very hard words are longer but not too complicated the graphics are fun and in a pinch I shall play a few words just to pass some time but it does not keep me,47,185
2587,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this game is ok i do not like it as well as a word search glad it was only 99 cents,20,186
2588,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,when it asks for a clue i thought it should give a clue about the word not just a letter,20,187
2589,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,my daughters and i love this game we actually think that the harder ones are easier as there are more letters we work together as a team,27,188

2637,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,if you remember when you played hangman on a piece of paper with your father you will love it five levels of difficulty six categories of words animals common words food human body office and business transport and vehicle i took one star off because it goes through only eight steps of execution two for the gallows and six for the hanged and i would sadistically prefer a slower process maybe ten or eleven steps i also would like a better and more humorous image of the hanged unfortunate one but it is all minor in comparison with the joy of feeling yourself a child again this time playing it hi-tech style with your own kids edited later some reviewers correctly pointed out that when you got the word correctly the game does not give you a feeling of satisfaction by showing a completed word instead you immediately see a half screen that covers the word and a question whether you want to play again it is idiotic on the part of the software creators and they should fix the problem as soon as possible actually i have to take another star for this reason but i will keep four for mentioned above nostalgic feelings,203,236
2638,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,5.0,positive,i love the guessing i love the little hangman it is exciting to see if i get it correct on each of the different levels,24,237

2648,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,the games gives one the option of level of difficulty i liked that because i may know more about one subject than the other choice of hints is good i do have trouble giving my review of purchases due to the requests like title required is that my title or title of purchase,53,247
2649,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,why would they assume a 3 letter word is easy in hangman can not play against anyone the drawings are silly i played 3 or 4 times and probably will not play again unless i am really bored,36,248

2657,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,play hangman has a great deal of puzzles with timing there are all different difficulties with different topics the game helps with learning vocabulary,24,256
2658,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,the ones rated easy are harder having more letters makes it easier to guess some correct ones i also feel some of the words are very obscure,27,257
2659,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,1.0,negative,this is the worst game ever it freezes up a lot and you have to do a complete shut down to get it to completely stop the freeze it also repeats the lame words it uses,36,258
2660,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,2.0,negative,the game is played like traditional hangman-try to guess the correct word for each wrong letter guessed a limb is added until the man is hung the little man is unimaginative and looks the same every time the words that you guess are divided in to easy hard levels and into categories animals transportation and more there is very little difference between the levels and the categories are very broad for example the animals category uses every obscure dinosaur name it kind of takes the fun away when the word in question is not really something you recognize even if you happen to guess it additionally when you do get the word correct the screen flashes to a box that reads would you like to play again you never get to read the finished word the box pops up as you guess the last correct letter this simple game could be lots more fun and better thought through try again jared,160,259

2669,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,only minor gripe is you can not see the word if you have won it seems it should not matter but when you are playing with a child you can not show them the right answer if you lose the right answer appears in small text you have to look for it it would be better if you saw the right answer where the blanks were it may be a minor point but you do not get to have the satisfaction if you win of seeing your correct answer with final state of your character often i might get three good guesses in a row with my last chance,105,268

2672,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,3.0,neutral,this game available for the kindle paperwhite is exactly as it portrays it is a simple game with 5 difficulties and 6 different categories it is as basic as real hangman you guess letters and a body part is added to the man each time you get one wrong it is a good time-waster especially as a quick game when your waiting for something or even when you are going to the bathroom ok hope this helps,72,271

2674,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,i could have ordered the hangman specifically for kids but i figured that they can start on the super easy level on play hangman and grow into it the only reason i rated it four stars as opposed to five is that we still have some lag time until the kids are truly into this game the oldest is doing fine with the game age seven but the youngest is still fixated on pairs,73,273

2683,Kindle_Store,B00A6UMSZO,4.0,positive,very straightforward and just like the way it was played on paper no need for instructions just start filling in letters i would say it would have been more fun if the jared co had expanded on it a little bit and made some twists available like high scores or progressive levels if your man does not get hanged or a stay of execution if you get three in a row something screwy like that it does offer very easy easy medium hard and very hard levels plus different categories to let you focus on what the word could be i liked it because my kids and i can play together at bedtime or while waiting for the chronically late doctors,119,282
