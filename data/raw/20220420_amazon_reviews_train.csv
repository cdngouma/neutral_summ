AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"The bandit wouldn't stay put...at all.  How could it help my lower belly when it kept riding up to the smallest part of my waist?!  It was really frustrating.  I still wore it for about 4 weeks but measured my lower tummy weekly and it wasn't getting any smaller so I finally gave up.  It also got this permanent fold in it that wouldn't go away.  I suppose if you have zero curves (and definitely no butt), it might work but it didn't work at all for me.",88,0
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I am wearing my Bandit now. It made my belly get back to its shape sooner by supporting weak muscles and pushing it. It worked for me. Do measure yourself. I have the Xsmall even my clothing is XL.,39,1
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"i was so excited to get to order this while i was still pregnant, and planned to use it from the day of birth thru 6 or 8 weeks.  i was QUITE disappointed when it was FAR from fitting me at the hospital.  i ordered a cheaper abdominal binder off amazon after a few days of the BB still not fitting me.  it was great- 4 days later i was able to get in to the BB and i was excited to switch.  i've been wearing the BB for 3 days now and i am still quite disappointed in it.  it bunches and rides up my back (making it completely noticable under even jeans and a tshirt), its incredibly uncomfortable (more so than just squishing all my insides LOL), i'm constantly pulling it down and almost have to re-do it every time i sit/stand up.  i will say that it does seem to be working w/ the squishing the belly back down, but so did the much cheaper alternative (and it was actually semi-comfortable).  i would definitely recommend the cheaper belt over this one to any of my friends.",189,2
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I was very skeptical about purchasing this but since I needed results fast since I was a bridesmaid in a wedding 2 months post partum, I thought I would try it!

After only ONE week of wearing this, I was able to fit into a few pairs of pre pregnancy jeans and back in my pre pregnancy shirts!  I am not joking either!  This product did the job it claims to do!!!  It also provided excelent back and tummy support needed after delivering a baby, I felt great!  It is also helping with my stretched out skin and stretch marks.  I cannot say enough good about this product! My only gripe is that it buckles and creases after wearing it 24/7 and after washing, it doesnt uncrease...oh well.  It still did its job and I have confidence only one week post partum!!!  GET IT!",144,3
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I ordered the XL in the Belly Bandit because that is the size I normally wear when not pregnant. I am 5'10"" and an athletic build with a larger bust. I felt like I couldn't get the Bandit tight enough to suck me in and it made me really hot. I don't know if it is because the Belly bandit uses velcro but I just didn't feel it was effecient at what it was suppose to be doing. I thought my spanx did a better job at holding me in than this and was easier to move around in. I think I wore it twice and was over it. Wasted my money!",112,4
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I bought 2 bandits, one small & one xs, I worn the small for the first 4 days after delivery (41 inch waist just before labour) then I moved on to the xs, after 9 days my stomach was flat. It's now been 12 days since my baby was born & i have 2 inches to go to get back to my pre-pregnancy waist size (26 inches). I found this product very comfortable to wear (even to sleep in) it's ok to wear under loser fitting clothes but shows under tight shirts.",92,5
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I bought it for my sister and she loves it... Even thou I didn't know much about these things... But she mentions that it is a great product, very soft, not scratchy and make her feel very comfortable.",38,6
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I bought this bandit in the hopes that I could wear it as described.  The box says to wear it day and night, except to shower.  Well, it dug into my ribs when I was sitting up in bed nursing, and it rolled up under my clothes, so it became impractical to wear all the time.  Eventually, I just began to forget wearing it, so I basically wasted $45.00.",69,7
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I want to love this product as I had such high hopes for it based on other reviews Ive read however I have tried to use this for a few weeks now and its just not made for tall women.

The band doesnt cover the area it needs to in order to be effective. If I wear it low It gives me major back fat and if I wear it high my lower abdomen is completely uncovered.

I wouldnt recommend if you're tall or have a long torso. I am 510.

FYI I did buy the correct size. I checked it on their website and contacted their customer service department to be sure.",113,8
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Waste of money. Im hourglass shape trying to get rid of the post baby belly budge and this thing just kept Migrating to right under my boobs. So uncomfortable.
How do they claim this is for an hourglass shape??? No way. Its horrible sitting while wearing this. Only buy this if you have no hips.",55,9
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Extremely uncomfortable. Tried two different sizes but couldn't wear it for more than 10 minutes at a time. It either pushes extra fat out the top or bottom, and pinches when I try to sit. Impossible to nurse while wearing. I'll just stick with the eating right/working out to lose the gut, which appears to be working fine.",58,10
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Sizing on this is completely off. Doesnt fit at all. Didnt gain any weight during my pregnancy and had my baby 14 weeks early and still didn't fit into the size they said I would :(,36,11
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,followed the sizing chart diligently and bought it for postpartum.  by the time it was time to put it on it was too small and i couldn't return or exchange it.  if you decide to buy this wait until a week after you give birth,45,12
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I originally purchased this item in a size small but come to find out only after 24 hours I really needed a size Extra Small. I really love the results I'm getting from this product but there are a few things about it that are a bit annoying. The material is nice and firm which makes the product really have great results but as your waist is smaller than your rib cage area and hips, the band will fold. Once it folds it has a permanent fold in the band. Every time you wear it this fold will be present which causes the band to slide up in the back above the butt. I continue to wear it but I am constantly pulling it down in the back and it will immediately move right back up. My waist line is great just 4 weeks after childbirth, I give a lot of credit to this product and breastfeeding, but there are just a few annoyances you will have to deal with. FYI I wore this 24/7 except for when I showered.",180,13
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Shipped quick and product was just as advertised. Giving 4 stars for the band itself. Its grear as long as Im standing and moving. But if I sit or lay it rolls up and is difficult to reposition especially if you have a newborn in hand.,46,14
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"This did its job, but maybe I expected more. It creased right away, and the creases never straightened out so it stopped serving its purpose, almost. But, it did help when I wore it several hours a day. I was only able to get about one month use out of it.",51,15
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"helped me with lower back support after giving birth, highly recommended",11,16
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Really helps my stomach to feel tight and help my stomach to look flat.,14,17
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I got this for my girlfriend because it was on her registry she loved it.,15,18
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I'm 2 weeks postpartum and bought this for the flabby tummy. I have wide hips and a smallish waist, and this thing just won't stay in place. Every time I sit, it rides way up, and even bending causes it to slip. I've had it one day and think I'll have to return. ",53,19
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Great belly wrap. It does the job youll see progress in a few days. For me i wore this 3days postpartum it did help shrink my tummy in less than a week but then after that it just stays that way there was no more additional progress. Good quality wrap as well. But i think price is too much for something u will only use for say about a month. Well depends on every woman. This is my review.,79,20
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I felt this product ran a little small, but it is supposed to be tighter. I slept in mine a lot, but I found myself waking up in a dripping sweat, so I wouldn't recommend wearing at night. Great to wear around the house and helps things tighten up a bit after the trauma of giving birth.",57,21
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Really helped me with my diastasis recti after I had my baby! Helped so much with back and belly pain from sore muscles after delivery.  Sizing was spot on,29,22
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Returned I purchased as a gift and the person didn't want.,11,23
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I ordered large. A small was delivered. I returned the product. If a company cant get this one basic process correct then I am not wasting anymore time on them. In the end I was better off not using the band. My muscles seem to have recovered pretty well after my cesarean operation.

The band seemed pretty sturdy, but was almost too thick to be comfortable under clothes.",68,24
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Cinched ok when not sitting or bending.  Rolled up and gathered/bunched up quickly.  Ok of you have no waist.  Didn't work for me at all.,25,25
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I'm 10 days postpartum with our second child, and I can button my pre-pregnancy jeans. Sweet!

Sizing Note: I was right on the border between two sizes, so I sized down. I had to wait a few days to wear it, but it will be more useful to me in the long term.",53,26
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Wife bought it, and she likes it quite a bit.",10,27
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,This product futs great. Was very snug the first day...but as it does its job and my belly gets smaller it fits better and better!,25,28
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I ordered this based on the companys sizing chart, it ended up being a whole size too big. After returning and ordering a Small, I had good results. One con would be that the material creases easily and bunches up. I ended up rotating the band so that the Velcro closure was on the back and it helped somewhat.",59,29
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Want to return! It does not fit and you can feel & hearvthe Velcro while wearing it.,17,30
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"One of the reviews I read before purchasing was this stated that the fit was wrong, if you use the sizing chart on Amazon, yes, that is correct - you will get the wrong size.  Go directly to the Belly Bandit website and use that sizing chart and you will get the correct size.  I love this, so far.  Only had it for a few days but is helping my back tremendously.",72,31
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I got an extra small since I was between sizes and this fit me a couple days after delivery. I don't wear it all the time, but I wear it while Im bed. It feels really good when I wear it. My backs been hurting after the delivery.",48,32
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,So impressed by this product! Very comfortable and it really works well. I didn't start using it until 5 weeks PP but still feel it was worth the money.,29,33
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Yes I had received a package,but package was all open ,I am not happy about ,I think a item is not a new item I would like To return then ,I always buys onlime though amazon if you want me continue to buy then please unopened package or use item",50,34
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I loved the material but the sizing is horrible... I bought a large based on the sizing chart I was only about to wear for 3 days after now it's just too loose. Supports nothing.,35,35
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,Stretched out within the first week I wore it  Measured my waste correctly before I bought it and it was still too big within the first few days of wear...,30,36
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Bought in Large--had twins too!  Used one provided by hospital first week and then fit into belly bandit in a large one week Postpartum.  Now going on 2 1/2 weeks postpartum I'm going to need to order size down!  This thing really works!!,43,37
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I had originally went to the belly bandit website for the sizing. It fit just like it was suppose to - snug but still able to be Velcro shut. Im so glad I bought it. It helped a lot with core support once I delivered.,45,38
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,Wanted to love this and use it but it's not true to size. (Runs small) and it bends weird and doesn't lay nicely at all. Complete disappoinment.,27,39
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I like this belly band a lot and the fit is snug but perfect for what I was looking for.  I really think this helps a lot with the postpartum healing process too.  I started wearing it on occasion right after I got home from the hospital from having my son. Although I did not have a C-section it really helped to reduce the pain I had from cramping in the few weeks after delivery and of course holds in all that extra baby fat and swelling that is still going down after birth.  My only complaint it that the seam is really thick where the velcro attaches which makes it hard to wear discreetly underneath tighter clothes.,118,40
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I started to wear it two weeks after my c-section until I was about 3 months postpartum.  It most certainly helped get me back in shape quicker than I think I would have on my own.  People couldn't believe how quickly I was back to my normal size!,48,41
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Worked well! Now I need a smaller size!,8,42
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"My torso is a bit long, so this creates a bit of a muffin top effect. I guess if you're squeezing the fat it has to go somewhere, right? Anyhow, was using something similar from the hospital after my c- section, then stopped. Started having back pain, incision pain, and pain with stretch marks right under my belly button. This added the support I was needing to aid in my recovery. One week later, and my core muscles are definitely strengthening, my stretch marks are smaller, and I'm almost totally pain free. I wear the band as often as I can, even to sleep and work out. Wish I would've continually worn something post c- section to aid in healing!",120,43
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I really wanted to try this post baby, but it was so awkward and uncomfortable I ended up returning.  It might work if you have a straighter build vs. hourglass.  I couldn't get it to close properly without either gapping or bunching.  I decided the money would be better spent toward some workout classes.",54,44
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I really don't like this product! It's too short (I'm 5' 7"" and it didn't cover much of my torso). It also is very hot! It's uncomfortable and gives you a cylindrical shape with ni curves. It also shows under clothing very easily. The fabric creases like it said it would, but in doing that, it makes you look like you have really bad back fat rolls! LOL",68,45
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"Expands soon, couldn't use after a month. I ordered small based on the instruction/ size chart and it become big after using less than a month. I am really disappointed with this product, my tummy still looks big and i couldn't wear the belt as it expanded and not tight enough. I would like to get a refund or replacement.",60,46
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"This thing is awful. It's not long enough for my long torso, so it either causes bulges of back fat above it, between it and my bra, or it fails to hold in the lower part of my belly. It rides up like crazy; it's incredibly difficult to close the velcro and have it aligned, and it has creased making it very obvious under clothing.",65,47
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"This worked great! I will be ordering again, if I get pregnant again. I wish I ordered in a smaller size. I was going back and forth between a medium and a small. I got a medium. I'm 5'5 and weighed 160 at the end of my pregnancy. The band was too big after a week postpartum and I switched to the Bellefit gurdle. The product is well made and as described.",72,48
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I'm a size 6 pre-pregnancy and only gained weight in the belly. I thought a medium would fit according to the size chart but it did not fit after i gave birth, it only went around my post partum bellu half way. It's way too small.",46,49
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,This was way too small and uncomfortable after my c-section. I sent it back and continued wearing the wrap they gave me at the hospital.,25,50
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"So uncomfortable. If you actually have kids to chase around and breastfeed, you will hate this thing. Not to mention it doesn't breathe and is super hot (if you're in summer months or a warmer climate), wish I could return it.",41,51
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"Wish it felt a little more ""secure"" but does the job.  I wish it wasn't so expensive considering how quickly it became too big (yes I went by the suggestions in the measurement guide)",34,52
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"This sucks. I don't understand why they are so many positive reviews. It is over priced and once you buy it, you cannot return it so you are taking a chance with the tummy band.
It sucks because of the material. It's like plastic and it doesn't hold it's shape around your back and keeps crinkling. You constantly have to readjust. Additionally it's not wide enough tto give you hip and tummy support which you need postpartum and I am 5'3 feet,. I ordered a medium and it fits good.
Save your money and reuse the hospital provided bands or buy the ""sweet sweat band."" Works just as good.",109,53
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Sizing worked perfectly as described. This was my first pregnancy so I have nothing to compare it to, but I am so glad I bought this and used it postpartum. I think it definitely played a large role in being able to return to my pre-pregnancy body. I was able to return to pre-pregnancy jeans less than a week from birth.",61,54
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Was unable to use and unable to send back, which I was not aware of. If you have a c section, you will need the bamboo one.",27,55
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I bought this for post partum and wore it the day after I gave birth. My stomach shrank really quickly so I soon outgrew this. It was ok the first few times I worke it but then it became too big and started bunching around my stomach. Worked well for a while.,52,56
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Ordered size xs per sizing chart and it's too small for me 2 days post partum. Would like to exchange for small without having to buy another but because I bought it in march I cannot exchange or return it.,40,57
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"Ordered according to size chart, I couldn't close it until 2 week post partum. Didn't notice any significant difference with use.",21,58
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Would not reccomend. I was constantly pulling up on this and it never really worked. I would stand up and the whole thing would be below my belly.,28,59
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I realy do love it but i did recomand the smal and i received the medium and now i cant return it to get the smal,26,60
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I was a size 18 pre pregnancy and ordered the XL. I ordered it a week after delivery and I have it as tight as it will go. I feel good wearing it and nicely supported. After wearing it all day I am ready to take it off at night. I wore a support band in the hospital, but it made my stomach so itchy. The belly bandit does not do this. I'm glad I bought the belly bandit, and I will be purchasing a size down to continue my recovery process.",92,61
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Really helps keep things in check to work out and prevent further stretch marks.,14,62
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I am rating based on looks alone because I did not have the opportunity to wear the product. I measured at 41 weeks pregnant and was given a size to buy. This was entirely too small. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the actual material of the product is nice.,53,63
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Helps get uterus and hips back in shape,8,64
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,It's useless. It does not help reduce any fraction of inch of my belly after using it for 3 months. And it's very uncomfortable to wear.,26,65
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,used this with my first baby and again with my 2nd.  works wonders if you wear it!,17,66
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I Love My Belly Band. I feel so much better after I wesr it around the home. It is very comfortable and flexible. I would recommend for anyone looking to help that baby belly shrink.,35,67
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"GREAT product. Everyone keeps saying that they can't believe I just had a baby.

I used mine the first day I had my baby in the hospital. It was hard to get closed, but by day 3 when I was leaving the hospital, it was the perfect fit. I'm 4 weeks postpartum now and still wear it. I think it really does help. There are so many gimicky products out there for post pregnancy, but this one really does help and really does work. Worth every penny and I will recommend this to all my friends.",96,68
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"Stiff and uncomfortable, very hot in the summer!",8,69
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I had my baby 8 days ago via cesarean and this has been such a help! I feel held in and my belly has drastically reduced in size much quicker than with my first. I'm able to use my abdominal muscles more and don't have to worry about straining my incision. I highly recommend this!,55,70
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Loved this and used it for the first 3 weeks, but then bought the bamboo version which is much softer and easier to wear all day long. Belly bandit has great products!",32,71
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I measured myself before looking at their sizing chart. For 37"" inch waist they recommend a size small so thats what I ordered.
After three days it was already too large to have lasting effects. The band definitely works and I started using after two weeks of delivery.

I like to exchange for an extra small as I love the product and sent seller an email to see if I can exchange for an extra small and waiting on their reply. Will update you once I hear from them.

Due to material band will crinkle. But doesnt affect results.",99,72
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I was pumped to get this and look slimmer. It loses its shape fast. XL was too big, L isn't just right and medium is too small.",27,73
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I had heard great things about the belly bandit, but this was such a bummer! It was WAY to small - I'm a size 4 - 6 waist 27 pre pregnancy and around currently while losing weight. I know you're supposed to cinch this, but you would need a tractor to get this thing to velcro together! Not sure who they are setting the small to fit.",67,74
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"This is a post pregnancy must have! Began using right after having a c-section. In the beginning, I had to use all my strength to get the velcrow to touch but within a week I lost three inches. This helps tremendously to compress the stomach and jump start your body to feeling somewhat normal again. Ended up using around the clock for about three weeks until moving to another product by the same maker as the Belly Bandit became to large (it didn't stretch out by any means; my body just completely changed).",93,75
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I'm really bummed. I've only worn it a few times and the material seems to have pulled in the middle causing an hourglass shape. I'm a pretty tiny girl so I'm not sure how I could have caused it to do that.,42,76
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Product runs small. Good quality, and works great.",8,77
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I started using at about 3 weeks postpartum. I wanted to see what size I would need since I knew I would shrink in size pretty quickly, and that was fortunate because I probably would have needed to buy two different sizes of the Belly Bandits. I do have a bit of trouble sitting in it, so I only wear at night when I sleep. I've seen my tummy shrink a little bit so far! Will see how this works out but so far, I'm happy with it.",88,78
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"Do not waste your money on this one. Get the bamboo one instead. I am 127 lbs after I delivered 4 weeks ago with a 28"" waste. I got the xsmall and it fits fine. However it folds so easy and crinkles. Feels so cheaply made. I got the bamboo one and it is so soft and smooth and MUCH more comfortable to wear. Save yourself the money and go straight for bamboo style.",74,79
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Amazing. Used this for post partum to get my belly back. Went from 39 in to 31.5 in in 2 weeks. Would defin8tely recommend. Started with a large and got down to a Xtra small. Can't say enough to good things about it.,43,80
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I love the first belly bandit that I got for right after the birth. I wore it every day and it was wonderful. I didn't have one after my first kid and it felt like my guts were gonna fall out of me every time I stood up. This time with the belly bandit it was much easier to stand up straight even right after birth. Also my uterus contracted back to normal size in RECORD speed- my midwife was impressed. My stomach also shrunk much faster and I am pleased with the results. Once I shrank down to the smallest the first BB would go, I decided to get the next size down (extra small). This was a mistake. Even though the small is now too large, it was time to give up and go for their corset. The extra small just rolls up on itself and causes me to look all lumpy from outside my clothes so I can't really wear it anywhere besides the house, and the way it scrunches up is uncomfortable.",176,81
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"Slightly large in circumference, and a tad short for a girl my height (5'10"") but overall a quality product.",19,82
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Shrunk my stomach in half in a few days,9,83
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Worth every penny! Wore this for the first week after delivery of my first baby and saw huge results, also definitely helped support my back which was awesome.",28,84
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"After less than two weeks of using this as directed the band is constantly scrunching up in the middle and riding up. The scrunching is so bad that there are now permanent ridges in the middle of the band. I really wanted to like this and I think it was working well, but I don't know that I can continue using it when it is this uncomfortable due to the bunching.",71,85
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Just rides up again and again, very uncomfortable to wear, gets wrinkles in it the first time you wear it  and they never go away. I hated this product, it didn't do anything for me. What a joke.",38,86

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I wanted to love his product so badly. I measured myself at 37 weeks and ordered it right away. The moment I was able to in the hospital, I put it on. Within two hours, it had folded over and scrunched up and would not go back to its proper position. I also got the kourtney kardashian version which worked out a little better. This version is not good for people with long torsos either. The kk model later about 2 weeks of 24/7 wear before it just folded too much. I looked slim in this while wearing it and almost bought into it too. Six weeks of round the clock wearing a belly bandit girdle and at 7 weeks, the pooch is right back where it was. These products are a hoax.",133,88
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I had an emergency c-section and am thankful for this product! It not only helped my uterus shrink faster but it decreased the pain. I would just put it above the incision so it doesn't get infected (I originally wore a hospital band and it infecfed my incision). I definitely plan to use the band in my next pregnancy.,59,89
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Must have for postpartum recovery!! I ordered 2 different sizes to keep wearing as my belly shrunk. Wore 24/7 starting day 1 after delivery. The extra support felt great too.,30,90
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Love this product! Just be aware I gained 33 pounds with my pregnancy. I usually fit in a size small. It took about a week for my stomach to slim down and than I could put on the belly bandit. But I'm glad I didn't go up in size otherwise it would of been too big. Better to go smaller than larger,62,91
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I would not recommend this at all. Instead, I'd recommend getting the leggings from this company. This band s extremely uncomfortable to wear, it was hard for me to bend over because it was so thick, and pushed up against my breasts when I sat down and when I breastfed my daughter. In the summer, definitely do not buy this, wayyyyyyyyyy too hot. for me, I felt like it did nothing and due to how uncomfortable it was, I rarely wore it, I purchased it at a baby fair and I think it cost about 50-60. This was the only thing I splurged on while pregnant. What a waste of money I could have spent on my baby.",118,92
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"It did get an annoying crease in the very middle of the band within two days of use. I'm a lean (135 lb before pregnancy, 160 at 40 weeks) and 5'8"" with a long torso. However, the band is comfortable and easy to use. At three days postpartum I needed my husbands assistance in order to be able to fit in it. The next day I was able to put it on my self. It works like a charm, this was my second pregnancy and at 5 days postpartum I'm wearing my size 4 stretch jeans. I did not fit into my pre pregnancy clothes after the first child for about 6-8 weeks and I was 8 years younger then (late20's). Now I'm in my mid 30s and this is amazing to me. When I went out for a walk with my newborn my neighbors couldn't believe how great I looked. I don't wear it to sleep I'm happy with the results I'm getting.",164,93
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"This is very comfy to wear all day and all night.  Fit was great, especially at first.  But after about 5 days this folds and bunches and really doesn't seem to function as intended anymore.  That's very disappointing considering how $$$ it was and also considering I was hoping to wear this 5-6 weeks.  I'm not sure this will survive structurally for much more than a week.  And yes, I have the right size... yes, I'm a bit flubbery all the way around... but this product is intended to be used post-pregnancy so the target consumer will be all of these things!!  I expected better.",105,94

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I ordered 2 after having my first child and I don't feel like it helped at all in shrinking my belly. I follow the sizing guidelines and it fit fine. I'll admit it was a good support garment because you basically have no core after childbirth and it is probably really beneficial if you have a c section (I didn't). I was fortunate not have much of a belly after he was born. In fact I think I have more of one now and I'm not sure if it is because I didn't wear my Belky Bandit for the recommended amount of time. I was able to tolerate it for 3 weeks day and night, not the 6 they say produces the best results. It is stiff and does not move with your body. It is difficult to wear under your clothes and does not stay in place. It requires constant readjusting. The worst was at night when it would slide up on my abdomen and squash my sore, milk-engorged boobs. My biggest complaint is it is not machine washable and if anyone else is like me it would get soaked during my delightful postpartum hormone sweats. Not fun!",199,100
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I bought a LG initially and have ordered a M now - I really am a fan of these! Received on time and as expected. I would recommend. I will mention that they do bend toward the top and bottom but I don't think they'd be as comfortable if they didn't.,51,101
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Great for the first month post partum. Its easy to put on and take off. It is very comfortable and is not to tight that it would make you feel like you are compressed inside of it, but tight enough to hold everything in place. Of course after a few weeks, you might want to go tighter or use a waist trainer or something but post partum this one is great.",71,102
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I had a size large from belly bandit.com and this size medium was wayyyy smaller than expected. Its smaller than the one from the webite,25,103
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"My wife loved it. It was very comfortable and did exactly what she wanted it to. It help get her baby weight off much faster. She said that she was able to get back in her per - pregnancy jean in a week and a half. With our first baby she wasn't able to get back into her old pants for a long time after.
We ended up having to buy a smaller size after the first week because she was dropping the weight and hip size so quickly that the first one we got was too small. Right after our baby was born she could barely get the larger size on, after the week and a half she was about half way through the smaller sized one.",128,104
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Extremely dissapointed. I started wearing this product immediately post-pardum. First off, it fit but a couple days later once my belly started shrinking, it became to large. Also, it was extremely uncomfortable. Every time I bent over, you could hear the loud crinkling of the Velcro...embarrassing. Plus, it was visible through all of my clothing and made my stomach look lumpy. It was also difficult to put on correctly. Overall it was a waste of money because after a month I became frustrated and quit wearing it.",87,105
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I actually bought mine at babies r us so I got to try mine on before I bought it (I also tried on the babies r us brand but the belly bandit had way more coverage). For sizing, I went by shirt size pre-pregnancy. I wore a large so I bought a medium so it would be a tight fit (for better results). I went on a (protein) diet and I have only been wearing it for a little over a month and I already need a smaller size. It works really well, just wish I could trade it in for a smaller size instead of buying a new one.",110,106

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Started with a medium right after I delivered my baby and about 3 weeks later I ordered the small that I can now wear for the next couple weeks. I was 150 when I got pregnant and gained 30 pounds and now I am 155 and the belly bandit really helped. I still have a little pooch that will only go away with diet and exercise.,66,109

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,I am disappointed by the product. The way it sits you can see it under clothes and I don't like the way it fits. I was really hoping I was going to love it.,34,111
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Way too small and there was no option to change my size. I was not happy about that. I will be returning this item.,24,112

Not happy
It's not smooth under clothes makes me lol bulkier",15,115
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I bought it tried loving it but it just doesn't work too well. It's very rough and shifts up after a long time wear. It did absolutely nothing for me.,30,116
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I have diastasis recti and this helps me feel more stable and put together when I'm working out. However it is super hard to put on myself and would be better if there were two separate pieces that came across. It gets bunched easily when I try to Velcro it myself but it is fine if my husband helps. It does not conform well to my body though and I get painful red lines at my waistline after wearing it for an hour or so. I would also like it a lot more if it were longer and covered my torso completely.,102,117
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,It cuts into my back and it doesn't fit right. I can't wear it.,14,118
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I was not able to use right after birth but I was able to use it by the next day. It helped significantly with the pain associated with post partem contractions while nursing. I made sure to have it on before nursing so I would be in less pain. I didn't have this device with my first two and I wish I would have! It was not comfortable, but it did the job I needed it to do.",78,119
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,This product really helps with support after giving birth. It also helps to smooth and flatten the appearance of your stomach. I'm not sure about long term results because I've only been wearing for about 1.5 weeks. My only complaint is the fact that you can see the place where the Velcro crosses over in the front which you can then see underneath clothes.,64,120
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Have had it on for a week and already notice my belly going down in size.,16,121
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Way too small and very stiff and uncomfortable.  Couldn't wait to take it off the first time I wore it. Waste of money.,23,122
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I love these things. I used one for about 6 weeks after delivering my youngest naturally and it really helped with my diastisis recti that never fully healed after my first. I only wore it around the house because it did show under clothes but I didn't leave the house much those first few weeks anyway. He just turned a year and the 'mama bump' that I sported after my oldest (8) is actually gone and I think my stomach *almost* looks like I never had kids. I recommend it to all the mamas I know.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",110,123
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"Worked great for 2 days... now it's too big haha. Which I guess isn't a bad thing. I got a medium. Prepregnancy I was 120lbs. I weighed 175 at the end, and am just now 6 weeks post partum, 145lbs. The medium is too large now, it is snug tightened all the way, but not tight enough. I will be ordering a small in the near future!",67,124
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"It rolls up from the hips, is difficult to put on by myself and is not hidden under clothing. I think you could probably get the same benefits from a cheaper version.
This being my first baby, I can't speak to if it helps more or not- I do like the support it provided for my back and feeling held together",61,125
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I ordered an XL and it fit for a week. Belly bandit has a trade in program but I won't be using it. After spending $50 I don't plan on spending more to size down when I followed the size chart,41,126
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Since I am currently expecting I am not able to use the product yet but wanted to give an overall feel for the product. Seems well constructed but very stiff. Expected the product to have a little give to it to make it more comfortable for using right after childbirth.,50,127
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I wore this for 3 days after I had the baby and immediately the fabric would fold over in the back. It was also too big to wear after the first week so now I have to buy another band to keep wearing. It was definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it.,54,128
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I had the size medium from my previous pregnancy and decided to get a small as well this time. After two days I was able to fit into the small and my stomach is almost back to its regular size! It's recommended to wear this for 6 weeks which I do plan to do because it gives great support!,59,129
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"Great product!  Wish someone would have told me about it immediately after having my babies, not 2 + years later!",20,130
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I started wearing this the day after delivery. This is my first pregnancy so I am not sure if it helped or not but it made me feel good that I was being proactive so quickly after delivery. It isn't comfortable enough to wear constantly but I found taking it off to nurse and sleep gave me enough break to keep it on the rest of the time. I am 4 weeks post delivery and now only wear it a few hours a day. I typically wore an XS-S clothing size pre pregnancy and in maternity clothes and the XS fits well.,102,131
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Not worth the money. Shows from underneath your clothes and slides up. Better off with a corset.,17,132
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Soon as I gave birth, I put this on. Comfortable and helps with swelling",14,133
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Fits as described. I'm not sure how well it works because it wasn't comfortable enough or discreet enough to wear outside the house.,23,134
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I love the postpartum support this offers - it is great. I'm not sure how much it helped my belly shrink but the support was good only wish this was cheaper.,31,135
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"Reviews are right.. way too small and I don't know how I could even wear this all day. Material is SO rigid and has no give which I understand why, but I wish there was some elasticity in it. Will be returning this item",44,136
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I found that the Belly Bandit was too stiff to be able to sit down while wearing.  I breast feed my little one and couldn't keep it on while feeding.  It's too much work taking it on and off with the frequency of sitting.  It does provide support when standing but couldn't make it work for me.  The return policy isn't great.  I bought it ahead of time and by the time I got to try it, I was unable to return it.  I wouldn't recommend this product.",88,137
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I've really loved my belly bandit! I'm four weeks post partum and my stomach has come back together nicely. I followed the size chart on the Belly Bandit website, and I'm glad I did! I almost ordered a medium because I was borderline small/medium when I initially measured, but I went a size down. Good thing! And actually, I need an even smaller size (I'm going to borrow my friend's extra small). I worked out my entire pregnancy, and went back to the gym after two weeks so I think my body shrunk quicker than most, so those results may not be totally typical. I'd definitely say go a size down if you're in between sizes, you want it to be tight! My friend said her husband had to help her get it on the first few days. Having the support around your abdomen and back is really nice when your belly is ""squishy"" after birth.",156,138

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Bought this after reading blogs about binders. It works great! The website sizing guide said I was an XS, glad I didn't follow that advice! Everyday it fits a little better as my belly shrinks. I try and wear it all day and night. Worth the investment.",47,140
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Ordered based on the measurements on their website and it was way too small.,14,141

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I have orders a few things that are belly bandit and been very happy, love the mother tucker tank and the leggings!!!  But I do not At all recommend buying the original belly bandit. I was hopeful it would give a little more compression and help with my stomach after having baby #2 but it bunches all over the place, itches like crazy and hurts my csection incision... It's also too large and I totally used the measuring guide!! I don't think this bad boy works and there's no way I'd be able to wear it discreetly in public. Would love to be able to return it since after wearing a handful of times know that it was a complete waste of money.",123,146
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Helped quickly bring my belly back to normal after giving birth!,11,147
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,I was very disappointed in this product. I had originally purchased the medium Belly Bandit for after my baby was born and loved it. After 3 weeks it was too big so I decided to go ahead and invested in the small size because the first one was so great. When I received the small Belly Bandit I was disappointed to find that the quality of it was not as high as the first one I had purchased. It was made out of a much thinner material and was not as comfortable. The tag was also not printed on the band itself like the first one and was constantly getting in the way of velcro the band.  Wish I had not wasted my money on this one.,127,148
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,So happy to have this after my first baby to help me feel more like me again!,17,149

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"It didn't fit the first few days after baby came,  but having a c-section it was too painful to attempt to wear anyway. I started wearing it at home after I was released from the hospital but it was very hard to sit in because its so stiff. I would get up and try to walk around for 15 minutes 4 times a day (for a faster recovery) and I would wear it during that time. I do think it helped me get small faster, I stopped wearing it after 2 weeks because I was almost back to my normal size (except a remaining 10 pounds I will have to lose with good old diet and exercise) All in all I think it did what it claims to do!",129,156
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I liked this but it was way bigger than I thought!  It only fit for about 2 days.  I do however, feel like it worked.  It also helped me feel less like a bowl of jello, so I was active far sooner than I would have been without it.",49,157
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"It's a really good band in my opinion, I was a little worried about the size but it fit perfectly. It feels comfortable even when I am breastfeeding my baby it feels right.",33,158
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"It's a little tight to put on, but that's the purpose. It's actually quite comfortable too. You will be able to see it under tight-fitting clothes, but that doesn't bother me. It helps with the loose feeling after birth.",39,159

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"This was a great belly band. It really helped me a lot after I gave birth. It felt like it helped to hold me together. It's nice a wide, so it gives lots of support. It never irritated my skin. Of course, wrapping a band around your stomach isn't the most comfortable thing in the world, but after birth, it was more comfortable to wear this than to not.",69,165
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I got the smallest size possible and it was to big after a week of wearing it. But I just sewed it. It helped me have a flat tummy after just 2 weeks post TWINS! I highly recommend it to everyone that asks me how I got my flat stomach so fast.,52,166

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Belly bandits are a must have to help your waist shrink back to its pre-baby position. This band is very comfortable and easy to care for. My only complaint is that I needed a smaller size after a couple weeks and they are expensive,44,170

The band's material is stiff and folds/buckles in areas when being worn, which looks terrible under clothes. Also, I'm long waists and it does not cover my entire stomach.  It's cheaply made.  You'd be better off getting spambot an simply wrapping an ace bandage.arubd your waste.",60,173

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"It does its job decently to shrink your belly first weeks postpartum, but I gave it 2/5 stars because it made my belly sooo itchy that after several weeks of wearing it I started wear it only for couple hours a day, and now at 5 weeks postpartum I don't even wanna wear it because of how uncomfortable it is. Also it bends really bad so it becomes really uncomfortable to move around. I believe  for $50 the material this belt is made of should be of better quality.",89,177
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,I would have given zero stars. It didn't fit worth a lick and didn't have instructions in English (not that it's not self explanatory) or in Spanish! It didn't even fit around my super skinny tween niece - so how is it going to fit a new mama who just had a big baby?!? This product was not at all what was described and I ended up returning it ASAP!,70,178
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I love this thing.  It really helped me and made me feel comfortable after my C-section.  It was a little tender in the early going but over all this product was great.,32,179
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,I bought this item in anticipation to giving birth to my third child. I had read a lot of the reviews and had heard great things about this brand in particular . I was very excited to use it and hopefully see results. I have been using it for three weeks now starting immediately after birth and I'm extremely disappointed with it. Within the first week of wear it bunched up in back and has never been the same to the point where the crease is A.so bent out of shape it is visible through clothing B. Painfully pushing into my back. At this point it is so uncomfortable I cannot wear it anymore and because i bought it before i gave birth it is over the thirty day return limit so that was basically 50$ down the drain!! Huge Huge disappointment!!,142,180
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Helped me get back into fighting form in no time... was helpful to feel strong again in taking care of baby.,21,181
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I had to return it.  I know some people love it - and it may be recommended for c-section but can I make a suggestion?

Get one for free from the hospital.

I had a c-section and got a ""hospital grade"" one that is more stretchy but gives great support. I would ask for two sizes, one bigger one for when you're still there and a smaller one when your stomach gets smaller.

Don't waste $50 - buy some educational toys or books instead",84,182
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I had a c section. This was just an awkward fit and sort of wrinkled and was hard to get on there straight and tight.,25,183
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Went down a size in a couple days, kinda exciting and frustrating at the same time. I would need to buy 3-4 of these in each different size to use postpartum. I would size down. Had great support.",38,184
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I just got this today and I already love it. I was using a stretchy band, but I feel the bandit offers more support and you can adjust it when your stomach gets smaller.  You can see it under clothes, but that's not an issue for me since I'm a SAHM. The other band cut into me so you could see the fat bulge, so I couldn't wear that one under clothes either.
My only issue with the bandit is the sizing. I went to their website and used the size calculator. It told me to get a medium but I only have an inch and a half left before the band is too big. I should have gotten a small.",121,185
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"This is great if you wear a second compression garment underneath it because it has a tendency to roll. It definitely served it's purpose but I've also bought a corset type waist cincher because I got a small and it's as tight as it goes, also it's not very long, so it's not compressing as much as I'd like. I'm definitely glad I got it though!",66,186
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,It definitely helped suck things in after my c-section. Not sure if it made things go down faster this time (second baby) but it was definitely worth the try. It did feel nice because it felt like it kept my stomach from moving which is not always the greatest feeling the first 6 weeks after surgery. My only complaint is it does bunch up a lot so you can't wear it under your clothing inconspicuously.,75,187
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"At first when I tried this on I thought it was going to offer great support, but within a few hours it was creasing and rolling up when I sat down. It didn't stay in place at all. It did seem to support my back when getting in and out of bed the first few days, but it was extremely annoying to have to adjust it every time I moved positions.",71,188
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Came on time and as promised. I'd say that this is true to the sizing guide so make sure to follow that. Only downside is that it's sort of difficult to put on by yourself. That said, I'd still buy it twice over. I had a csection and the binding helped support me.",53,189
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I wish I would have paid more for the bamboo belly bandit. This one is extremely uncomfortable and itchy. I couldn't keep it on for more than an hour at a time or I would break out in a rash.,40,190
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I was concerned about fit bc I have a long torso. It did fit as far as that goes. I don't think it helped my belly pp. Def not worth the price,32,191
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Go down a size if you're near the lower end of the size range for your size. I was within two inches of the low end and within one day I was at the end of the Velcro.,38,192
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"Great product, but stretches out easily. Wish I would have sized down for what was recomended.",16,193
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Good for after having a baby. Slim up and tighten that belly back into place.,15,194
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,The product is ok just that it folds a lot at the waist and back.,15,195
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"Felt like it didn't fit very well. Bought the medium and I'm not exactly a small lady, but it was still too big after having my baby. I ended up using it for some back support, but that was about it. Overall just didn't fit well.",46,196
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,It was too small but i was sent the wrong size so now just waiting for my new one ...but loved the way it felt.,25,197
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I just wish there was more velcro so you could make it very tight.,14,198
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Bunches up more than the bamboo version. Helps with back support and compression though...not to mention helping me feel less flabby and more like myself postpartum.,26,199
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Fit perfectly. I found that it fits better under my pants. It doesn't move or ride up when underneath.,19,200
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I like the concept but it didn't work as well as I hoped. It would ride a up, I might have gotten it too big though.",26,201
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Awful! Hard, stiff and apparently you need to be 6 foot tall for this to fit. I'm 5'5 and this thing legit goes past my boobs. Can't even wear it.",30,202
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,I used this with my first pregnancy and it really works. It can bunch up at times and be uncomfortable after wearing for awhile but the results are worth it! Because there isn't much Velcro you will end up having to buy a smaller size which can get costly. I think I may buy Velcro to sew on myself to try and make this one last!,66,203
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,Too big and I can't exchange it.  Material is too stiff for my liking.,14,204
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Purchased a medium per belly bandit website specs. The band fit for one week postpartum and then was was too small and velcro would not catch tight enough. I could have purchased several different sizes of another product for the price of one of these. Save your money and buy something else.,52,205
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I wore the shrinxx first over the cpanty and the velco wore out so I decided to try the belly bandit. At a local store they had the Belly Bandit made out of the organic material only in an extra small. I tried the extra small and I could barely get it velcroed so I felt like I needed to get a small, the small is almost too big which is frustrating. I decided to save a few dollars and order the original.  I do wish I would have ordered the organic it was much softer than the Belly Bandit original. Also after only wearing it for one week the band has folded in half in the back and on the side which is quite annoying. I do think the product works so I rated it four stars however I am NOT impressed with the quality of the original Belly Bandit.",151,206
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I purchased before delivery according to the suggested sizing calculator on the website. A couple of days after delivery, it was hard to put on and seemed too small but a week later seemed like it fit just right. Fortunately I haven't had to use much due to breastfeeding so I don't have a long term review.",57,207
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Product as described and looks like it will be helpful once I've given birth.,14,208
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I had ordered a medium through Target and it was too big. I'm 5'4"" and pear shaped, 137 lbs pre pregnancy. I ordered the small and put it on lying down and sucking it in, with my husband's help. I'm giving this 2 stars because it folds up at the bottom and folds in at the waist and the front. It does not move well with you, you either have to be lying down straight or sit up straight in order for it not to fold. best advice is to wear it backwards. I wear this over a cotton tank top to avoid sweat. I recommend not buying this and searching for a better postpartum wrap.",116,209
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I really like this product- seems to have worked pretty well for me. Seems like it fits a little big, though. I was a size 6 before getting pregnant with twins. I bought a medium 3 days after the babies were born, and it was too big. I had to order a small instead. (Don't worry- they won't take items like this back for sanitary reasons, but they did work with us about receiving a product we were in satisfied with).",81,210
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Fits much better than the Medela band that I used after a previous pregnancy. Easy to use and can feel a noticeable difference in lower back support.,27,211
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Too small! Buyer beware when sizing they do not let you exchange!!!,12,212
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,HATE IT. Don't waste your money on this. It bunches up horribly.,12,213
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Thank fo giving me my tight tummy back after baby! Wish it was more convenient to wear but boy does it work!,22,214
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"My measurements had me between a medium and a small, so I opted for the small (thinking positively). After delivery, I could velcro it about halfway already. On day 3 I was able to velcro all the way - with no more room to tighten. I will have to get a smaller size (honestly, I'm not complaining - this is a good problem to have and I know it) - so the sizing can be tricky.
However, it feels AWESOME. It could cough and laugh more confidently and I just felt like I wasn't fall all over the place. I'm hoping the smaller size will help me get back to pre-pregnancy shape faster...but even if it doesn't, this just FEELS good after 9 months of stretching.",126,215
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Bigger than I expected as far as the support is great especially after c section. It supported my back and the flappy extra fat from pregnancy hanging from the incision. I was able to walk and take care of my 15 month old toddler and a newborn. My healing is  definitely a lot better than my first c section with this belly bandit support.,64,216
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Was not what my wife was anticipating. Did not live up to other more superior products.  Wife wore once and put it back in its box.,26,217
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I found it too big I feel there is no compression and the bel row you can see under your shirt.. To thick where it over laps,27,218
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"Product worked well to bring my stomach muscles together after giving birth. I couldn't wear it all the time bc it was long and would hinder breastfeeding. It also would cause my milk to let down if I sat too slumped in it. All in all, worth getting but has some issues.",52,219
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,This is a MUST have post baby!  Helps hold everything tight so it helps with comfort and pain. It helped me get back to pre-baby belly in two months.,29,220
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Beware of this product as with any binders it can increase your incidence of prolapse. This really helped with my c section, when I had it on I didn't feel as much pain moving. I would use it again but I will be careful as my friend ended up with some pelvic prolapse after using one which (according to my OB) can be brought on by these, not worth it at all.",72,221
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I was a medium before I got pregnant and I thought a medium Belly Bandit would work. I love it and I think it's helped me but I wish I'd gotten the small so it would be more snug for longer. Great quality though!,44,222
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,Folds constantly and is uncomfortable. Only works first couple of days before it starts to fold on the sides.,19,223
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"While this was completely uncomfortable with the first pregnancy I had, and I didn't wear it much at all, it helped me SO much with my second.  I was able to lose so much more in inches in the weeks right after birth and I had diastasis recti, so it also helped with the discomfort and side affects of that.  The fit is a bit small, but obviously as you shrink back down, the velcro can be pulled in more, so it will fit you as you need it to.  While I agree that you can see it under your clothes, it might not be the most comfortable thing, etc.  BUT this will help you size down quicker, will help your uterus to shrink back up & in and will help you with diastasis recti.  It is WELL worth the money and I would buy it again if I was ever to have another.",154,224
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,I used the sizing chart from the belly bandit website. The band was still too small. It's been 7 days since I've given birth and the band still doesn't fit. Sorely disappointed,32,225
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,I am 5'6 and 136 pre-pregnancy weight. I gained 30 pounds while pregnant and 10 days postpartum I have lost 18 pounds. The size small I ordered fits me and there is room to tighten the velcro as I loose more weight in the coming weeks. Not sure if this band will help tighten my stomach or just help me hold it in for a while. It is easy to see under a thin shirt or tank so I think a cardigan or second layer will be needed in order to wear it out in public,96,226
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I bought this just after having my 8th baby. I wore it for three days and it seemed to be making a big difference, however, I developed a terrible rash with large, itchy red welps around my entire waist. I stopped wearing it and it has taken 5 days for the rash and itchiness to go away. It is made with 75%polyester, 25%lycra, so I'm not sure what my skin reacted to, but im not able to wear it and can't return it, so, for me, this was a complete waste of money.",93,227
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"I bought this when I was 39 weeks pregnant & it fit as needed after my c section. I don't wear it around the clock because it's kind of uncomfortable for me to sit in (I'm 5'3""). It keeps everything tight and is doing what I wanted it to do!!",50,228
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"Horrible, i guess you have to be a certain shape in order tonwear this, but its suppose to fit after pregnancy hmmm?",22,229
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,Only issue is that it creases which can be an annoyance.,11,230
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Great post baby shaper. The small fit great and I highly recommend!,12,231
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I originally bought the more expensive softer version of this for after my c-section. That was a good purchase for when I was wearing it during the day because it was more comfortable. As  recovered, I have transitioned to only sleeping in my belly bandit and for that purpose the version here has been great. I would love to see Belly Bandit create a product that is adjustable as you lose weight, as now I own a medium, small, and x-small.",81,232
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"This would be a great product if I was standing a majority of the time. It held everything in and you could visibly tell if I had been wearing it during the day or not (I would pooch out more if I hadn't been wearing it for a while).

As a brand new mom, however, I did everything I could to stay off my feet. When sitting, the Belly Bandit would get pushed up and off my stomach, to mash painfully into my (tender) breasts. I used it daily for a week (starting two weeks postpartum), off and on for another two weeks, then almost never after that. Now, 7 weeks postpartum, I look pretty much the same as I did before I started wearing it. I might have had better long-term results if I had been able to wear it until I could start working out again, but it was just too uncomfortable to sit in.

There's really no curve to this product, nor anything to keep it from riding up. Next time I'll be looking into something that goes between the legs like the Bellefit.",187,233
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I am currently 2.5 weeks postpartum, and I feel that the belly bandit has been very helpful at getting my pre-pregnancy stomach back.  I started wearing it the second day after my daughter was born, and I usually wear it both day and night.  My husband and family have also noticed how well it seems to be doing.  I gave it 4 stars because like other reviews said, it does not lay flat and can be seen under certain outfits.  I'll usually still wear it anyway, because depending on if I suck it in or wear a looser shirt, it isn't that noticeable.  I would definitely use this product again with another pregnancy, and will continue to wear it with this one.

UPDATE: I have come to notice that if the product has become loose after wearing it a while, you can take it off for a few hours and it will tighten back up.",155,234
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"best purchase ive ever made, i started wearing it the day after i had my son and my belly definitly went down alot, it also gave me a lot of back support. if i was having more kids i would def buy it again, i always recommend to my friends",50,235
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Fitted as expected and shipping was on schedule ! Loved the deal.,12,236
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I like the product. Kind of hard to get used to at first. According to the size chart I needed a medium, but actually needed a small.",27,237
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,Love it! It fits well and is very comfortable!,9,238
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"This is a must have for postpartum belly support. Wow! This was my fourth baby and first time using one of these. I really noticed it a difference when I took it off. My back and belly felt wobbly and unsupported. My stomach shrunk down MUCH faster than it did with my 3rd babe. Cons? I live in the desert and it's way hot. Now that it is in the 90s, I can't hardly stand to wear it. Luckily, I am not needing it much longer. Fabric is not so comfy - I don't know what it's made out of but I think next to bare skin it would feel scratchy? My friend let me borrow her bamboo belly bandit and it felt so much more comfy. If I did this again, I would fork out the extra $ and get the bamboo. But it is a good product.",149,239
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,"I guess I thought this would fit like the belly band they gave me in the hospital post-hysterectomy, which was very soft-textures and super stretchy and very comfortable to have on all day and night. This one is nothing like that. It's a gritty scratchy rough fabric, very rigid in the shape, way wider than other bands and super uncomfortable to wear unless you're standing up tall. I'm returning it.",70,240

It's thick,rides up,bends & made creases that just won't go away wen when I wash it & try to iron it! I don't know if it did my body any good because I ordered a medium (according to their measurements) & it's just soo big! So I'm really disapponted..Im now wearing a regular victoria secret waist cruncher & I feel it's tucking and applying much more pressure than the bandit. Maybe if I got the small I would have wrote a diffrent review.",97,249

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,2.0,negative,I out grew this very quickly!  I even went by the size chart on the website!  As other reviews state it creases in the back & makes extra rolls on top of the band.  Can not wear it under any form fitting clothes because of the crease/gold it makes.  I was so looking forward to using it too,58,251

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,1.0,negative,"I ordered this cincher to help with post partum recovery- really just to help support my organs while my abs regained strength. I have the cheaper Medela version of this, too, and it worked much better. The both move around a bit, but the Belly Bandit was very stiff and wide, so that if I adjusted it to fit my hips and belly it would extend halfway up my ribs and have a significant gap around my waist. It was a little like wearing a cardboard tube. I returned it. For later recovery Leonisa cinchers and post partum panties worked really well, and are shaped like women's bodies, rather than tubes.",111,261
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,5.0,positive,"The sizing estimate on Belly Bandit's website was correct. I should have taken their advice, but I felt so much larger I got the size up and kinda regretted it. My friends that needed c-sections swear by this product, I got one just in case.

AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,"I would like to have given this 5 stars, but it is definitely visible under clothing and will roll if you don't immediately go back to a size 2 post-partum  However, I still love it because it made me feel whole again after giving birth, if that makes sense. It makes walking around in the hours and days after birth so much more comfortable, and definitely helped me feel like I recovered a little more quickly than I would have without it. It also offers a small measure of back support which is always welcome.",95,265
AMAZON_FASHION,B001LFP0EO,4.0,positive,This is great waist band. Make sure to check your size with chart. I followed the instructions and I got the right size.

She says that she likes the way that this feels, especially when she gets up out of a chair, or out of bed.  She tells me that it helps to make everything feel compressed and in tact.  The only reason that my wife rated it as 4 stars is that she says that she wishes that the material was more breathable since she's wearing it so often.  She also says that the velcro area is a bit stiff, so when she sits, it tends to ride up a bit.

AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,I give it a 3 for style and price.  Really runs small.  So if you are a true small you will be ok if you purchase  a large.  It was a nice gift for a friend.,36,0
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,5.0,positive,Perfect!! I LOVE it!!  Just remember that it runs small in size!!,12,1
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,"Something told me to order this in a XL and I am glad I did! It fits well, although why the neck opening is so narrow is beyond me. It's very pretty otherwise. I probably should have purchased a XXL as I wear a US size large, but as said before XL is good. Should be fun to wear when the weather warms up!",64,2
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,"This was a beautiful shirt. That being said, it was tiny.  I usually wear a large sometimes an xlarge. I knew they ran small so I bought the xxlarge, but it was still way too small.",36,3
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,Cute shirt. Pretty sheer so expect to wear a tank or camisole underneath. Runs slightly small but overall I'm happy with this purchase.,23,4
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,1.0,negative,I compare this to something found in the gutter,9,5
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,"Beautiful Lace blouse, but was too small in the bust area, gave it to a friend who loves it too.",20,6
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,The blouse is lovely  but very much smaller than expected. I would guess that  their size XL is truly a size M in this country ( blouse is made in China),31,7
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,5.0,positive,"Fits as expected. Is nice and comfortable but you need to order two or three sizes larger than what you normally wear! I ordered XXL. I normally wear a size 14 due to my bra size which is a 40 C. This is very important, because I had received them way too small. You get what you want for the price! It isn't perfect, but it is nice",68,8
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,4.0,positive,"BEAUTIFUL.  But I forgot to check the sizing - it's Asian sizing, which means XXX = size 12.  But it is gorgeous.",22,9
AMAZON_FASHION,B00OXVTDUK,2.0,negative,It was two sizes to small China sizes are smaller than USA sizes I even followed their size chart. It was wrong. However if you get one that fits like it is supposed to it is a very nice and comfortable shirt.,42,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"These are very thin, pull off easily without residue (rare!). The only odd thing about these is that on the crease, it actually had cut out slits along it, so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket/shirts.",45,0
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"sweat went right thought within almost 2 hrs of wearing it, not the best",14,1
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,So far they haven't really worked - won't stick to the fabric of my jacket.,15,2
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"I have tried several brands of shields, and most don't stay attached all day/evening. This purchase resulted in a great product that stayed put for as long as needed.  Love them and am hoping that I receive an equally excellent product when I need to reorder!",46,3
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"They do not stick well to the fabric. Bunch up, not comfortable.",12,4
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,It did not stick to the material of my shirts,10,5
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,My wife thinks that these things are great.,8,6
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,The item does not adhere  to clothing very well. It's basically pointless to use this product. Very disappointing indeed.,19,7
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,These shields were too flimsy. Did not sick and bunched up. Will not purchase again.,15,8
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,The shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket - I had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well.  just be mindful when you take the jacket off/put it on.  I will continue to use these - much improved from older versions that would come off.,56,9
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,Perfect for the Victorian Era Ball.  Now I don't have to wash the whole dress after every event.,18,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,Very hard to position. Not worth the hassle.,8,11
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"The idea seems great but once I started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat.

It's kind of a give and take, on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side its not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating.

Maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck.",70,12
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,Great product!  I used these for a series of interviews that I wouldn't have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview.  They worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used.,35,13
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"I bought 3 brands of dress-shield and I tried these last. These were thinner (like the 2nd brand) and I understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin, they are useless!!!!!!!!! People who buy these, sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time, money and  embarrassment. If you perspire, avoid these. If you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes, good enough!",75,14
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,"Helped prevent stains, but did tend to slip a little.",10,15
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,"I can see how these may not be the best for a shirt. However, they've saved me $$$ on dry-cleaning for my work blazers. A nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it's awesome to get a few wears out of each during EITHER a big client meeting or a hot spring/summer day. These will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure.",63,16
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"These are good in theory, but they don't stick to my clothing.",12,17
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"barely sticks to clothing, ends up bunched and then unattached",10,18
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"The adhesive doesn't seem strong enough. Several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when I applied them to silkier fabrics. On the plus side, these pads are quite thin and quiet.",41,19
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,It's not sticky and the material is poor.,8,20
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,They did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay.,23,21
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,I've only used this once. It worked fine.,8,22
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,I would not recommend this product. very bad quality for the price I paid.,14,23
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"Great idea, but held up poorly. Kept peeling off and sticking to my skin. No bueno.",16,24
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"Great concept, in theory...but I find they don't fit well in blazers (as I'd intended to use them).",18,25
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"These are perfect to protect your clothing from sweat and staining and odor. I use these in blazers mostly. They're perfect! I will say that if you're sleeves are tight, this shield will be difficult to apply/stay in place when you put the blazer on. They are the perfect size for the underarm and you can't tell they're there. These are must-haves for long work days.",66,26
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,I was very impressed. I plan on ordering from them for all my tattoo supplies.,15,0
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,I really like my gun. Run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,15,1
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,When i got this it had a few problems. Including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it.,21,2
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,The power supply went out on me and never worked again.,11,3
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also,12,4
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,Its doing good so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos . I love this item,23,5
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,machine is fine but the ink sucks had no problem other than the ink sucks terribly just doesnt mix well with skin I guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe,34,6
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink,21,7
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,"It is a good starter kit, but over heats with bigger tattoos, power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems, very nice people, i would recomend this kit",34,8
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up,49,9
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,The machine came within 4 days of me buying it. But the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily. A warning to first time tattooer's this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own. Also please for my own sake don't use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit) but i've never heard of the brand and something tells me it's bad ink. Other wise it's a perfect machine for beginners.,102,10
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,The kit came 1 day late but its cool . Lol the grip is not the one they show it's straight. N ink caps white no biggie . Thanks  you.,30,11
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,It didn't come with a grip! I waited forever and I searched everywhere and there was no grip,18,12
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,"I LIKE DRAGON HAWK PRODUCTS  , BECAUSE YOUR TATTOO KITS HAVE A GREAT PRICE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT IS STARTING OUT TATTOOING AND I CHECK OUT OTHERS BRANDS OF TATTOO KITS ,BUT NO  ONE HAD A BETTER DEALS ,BUT DRAGON HAWK IS THE PLACE TO START IF YOU LOVE TATTOOING AND WANT  GOOD DEALS OF TATTOO KITS, P.S WOW!  YOUR KITS ONLY HAVE A BIG BLACK INK BOTTLE THAT WILL LAST ME AWHILE AND SAVES ME MONEY, THANKS AND YOU GOT A COSTUMER FOR LIFE.....",86,13
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,Good for the money everything is working well just don't use this ink!,13,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,Great fun product.  Looking forward to the next dress up party. Going as the tattooed lady.,16,0
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,What a waste of money..this product is waaaaayy over priced for it's poor quality! I bought this kit to have my best friend (pro artist) draw an idea I had for a tatt on my arm. We followed the directions to a T and it still came off within the next day..the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use. One marker never worked bc it was dried up. And the adhesive is a joke..it's messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross. You'd honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers..and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice..invest in a real Henna Tattoo Kit..,114,1
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,I wouldn't recommend this product.  It's just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes.,13,2
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"pens work beautifull, but  after 3 days sometime less you need to remove.  Definatly not lasts lasting for weeks.  the latex covering feels gross and doesnt last long.  I will not purchase again.  Company did send out quickly.",38,3
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"I was disappointed with these. They're basically sharpies. They function the exact same way and the colors aren't true to the lids. It's fine to have them if you're expecting markers but they don't make convincing, or lasting, tattoos.",39,4
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"product does not stay on for more than a day,  Ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo. nice colors though!",22,5
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"Love love them where have these been,!  I love to change up my tattoo.  Never permant. Thank you love it",20,6
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"They don't stay at all, it says 2-3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and I was sadly disappointed.",20,7
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"This was really fun and I'm glad I got it because I enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough. They all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones don't work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos don't usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long. Either way, I still really like it and recommend it.",66,8
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"Needs many, many sheets of transparent tattoo paper to work properly. They're not included in the kit and not mentioned except for in the instruction sheet. do not buy from here maybe buy from the seller instead. These are just permanent markers with glue/adhesive. don't waste your money on this item.",51,9
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"The product is not as advertised.  Mine didn't come in a box, the cleaner and tattoo remover wipes were not in foil.  The tattoo remover is very dry, without the liquid mentioned in the how-to video on the Bewild website and took three wipes to remove a test patch of the topper.  The topper dries sticky and gets full of lint and who knows what.  the pens are OK with good colors.  Too bad the kit is so poorly put together.  Bewild get your act together!",86,10
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,The ink washed off without the sticky stuff. If you use the sticky stuff then the sticky stuff sucks off the fabric of your shirt and the whole thing ends up looking like you have black balls of dust stuck all over your skin and you look dirty and are sticky all week. Its like having the remains of a large bandid stuck on you but with a drawing underneath it. Also the yellows and light green pens don't even show up on skin.,84,11
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"Not what I though, there just like color makers, not worth the money",13,12
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,My daughter has enjoyed this set very much and has given lots of friends temporary tattoos,16,13
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"We had bought several different types of tattoo pens from area craft stores. Most of them had at least half the pens dry and useless and nonreturnable due to store policies. We bought these on amazon based on a friends recommendation and were pleasantly surprised.  Colors bright and vibrant. All the pens were in new condition, not dried out like the store pens had been. My only disappointment was that there really isn't a lot of ink in these, they dry up much faster than regular markers. For the price you would think they would last longer. I'll be buying more. Wish there were more colors or choices of colors.",110,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,One pen was dried out when I got it and the rest of the pens dried out after coloring only three tattos and they were not large ones. Very disappointed.,30,15
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"This was a gift,  came in a cheap plain box.  A lot of the pens do not seem to work.  The fine tips don't seem to work.",27,16
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Great alternative for kids who love to drawn themselves.  Ink lasts for a few days,15,17
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"The product is ok. You're better off getting the 18 piece version, or none at all, because I got multiple red, green and yellow markers. The yellows hardly show. The ""tattoo remover"" wipes are literally moist towelettes you get at restaurants. The most impressive part of the pack is the sealant, which is essentially watered-down glue. You're better off with Sharpies or other thin permanent marker (That doesn't run through the creases of your skin, mind you), Elmer's glue, water, and rubbing alcohol. Things you probably already have.

If you DO decided to buy this kit, I suggest a thin layer of baby powder slightly after applying the glue. This SOMETIMES keeps the sealant from collecting lint.",117,18
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,This product is really good pens work really well and it is very fun to use. Although the top coat is quite sticky after it dries put really nice way to make it stay longer. It fun to design things.,40,19
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,The thick sides only worked on all my pens. Couldn't get any detail out of them,16,20
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,The fine point on the markers did not work.,9,21
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"These markers are awesome but they do come off way too easily, even with the protective coating. Having a lot of fun with them at parties though!",27,22
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"Ok my daughter does Cosplay, these pens were so great for her costume, they stayed permanent and no smudging. She had arms and neck tattoos for 5 days.  I do wish we could get more cleaning wipes but were able to do with it.",44,23
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"So I got them in the time frame it, which was wonderful and all...BUT like several people have said they come dried out. I had never even used some of them the first few days i had them and they were dried up. ONE had mold on the fine tip! Im like what the heck?! Also they don't last more than 2 days if you even run a wash rag over it while bathing. Very disappointed.",76,24
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,The pen ink does not stay on like it says it should and when u put the adhesive on top to keep the tattoo longer it makes it look like it has a dark haze on it.... Tried to email the company because when we first opened the box of pens 3 of them were dried out.... So honestly I will stay with the sharpies!!!,65,25
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Love them! I think my daughter loves them even more! So fun to work with. I like being able to change--not really into permanent body art. These are perfect for that!!,31,26
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Some of the pens were dried out which I did not expect.  Did receive it in a timely manner.,19,27

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Some colors don't look nice on the skin. One pen was open and thin side don't work.,17,29
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"This kit was a gift for my teen daughters.  They have a lot of fun with it.  The tattoos don't last long even when you put the protective material supplied, but they still enjoy it.  I would recommend it.",39,30
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"I was so happy when they came in the mail. I opened them up, used them and thought all was well. the ink didn't run when I took a shower, but when I went to use them again they wouldn't work. If you happen to be looking for a one-time use, then you found it.",55,31
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Did not work well... Did not last... The two black pens stop working before I could finish the first temp tattoo. Not worth the money. Just use eyeliner or a sharpie.,31,32
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,My daughter loved this gift. Awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each.,19,33
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,These pens were defective.  A very disappointing birthday gift.  Half of the pens were unusable!,15,34
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,This kit is great for any artsy child! This was definitely the favorite Christmas gift!,15,35
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,I was really excited to get all of the different colors. However I found that it wasn't that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks. It's fun but I was disappointed,52,36
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like regular mark pens work nothing different just more  ink less,19,37
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,Does not stay on longer than one day,8,38
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Use these quite a bit and they stay on for a long enough (I don't use the covering either),19,39

All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,Worked really well. Need more black pens in the set though,11,41
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I didn't buy this and Im not recommending using temp tattoo markers. Use sharpies they have cleaner, clearer colors that show up well. You can get sharpie off easily with hand sanitizer or alcohol swabs and warm water it's simple so please don't waste your money when you can use sharpies.",51,42
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,I like to play with them. They are a bit to easy to come off. Fun to play with though.,20,43
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I bought this for my 15 year old niece & as far as I can tell she was thrilled with it!
She wants a tattoo when she turns 18, so I thought this would help her make that decision.",39,44
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"They are good colors and even without the coating, the design will last a few days.  Only issue is that after you first do them, you need to let it dry a bit and even then, a bit can rub off.  Very fun.",43,45
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,It was a total waste of good money being thrown in garbage.,12,46
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"Looks real, had several people come up to me and comment- hard part was telling them it was a temp!! Glue is sticky even when dry - use transparent powder to keep lint from sticking to it and keeping it clean after every wash.",44,47
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,I like it but its to low when I try to watch movies it is dim so what I'm saying here is its height is bad but otherwise its preety good.,31,0

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,Its ok but not what I thought it would be. I brought 2 and I'm not as happy as I could be. That could be my thoughts only. I don't dislike the cases. I wouldn't buy another one. In all the case is good and protects your tablet very well.,50,30
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,"For the Price it offers More Protection Than the Soft Cases, But, The Tablet Fell From the Arm of a Recliner & the Screen Still Cracked Because the Case Doesn't Lock.  if you Have Children or Pets, I Suggest a Case With a Locking Latch",45,31

Most cases you can leave your tablet right in the case while taking pictures. Also,this case does not stand when reading as shown in picture, it falls over. Just for those two reasons alone this case is worthless.",68,58

All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"I liked it a lot, it looks really nice on a hand and it doesn't look cheap. The only thing that was bad , few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly, so I had to fix it with pliers so that it wouldn't fall apart.",50,0

When she received it, the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring, or the bracelet. Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together.

All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"this is a really cute accessory. the ring is an incomplete circle so you can adjust it just right, the chain to the wrist is a good length. the one real drawback is it's actually pretty hard to connect he clasp on the bracelet part without help because of the weight  but I salved that by replacing the clasp with a magnate.",62,16
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,Kinda big I have small wrists. Very cute though,9,17
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,This thing fell apart like 10 min after I gave it to my Girlfriend. I would not recommend this to anyone. Do not buy this cheap thing. We didn't expect a high quality piece of jewelry as it was for Halloween but it didn't even make it to the party.,50,18

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,"I am a nurse, so I thought these pens would be great and easy to access attached to my badge holder.  This first one exploded the first day I used it all over my scrubs and I looked like a slob all day.  I thought it was just a freak accident so I decided to give another one a try.  The same thing happened.  There is definitely a flaw in the design and I will not be using them again.",80,1
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I use these quite frequently to take notes since I don't have a smartphone. The only complaint I have is that sometimes if you push the pen into its cap too hard, it will break. This is only a problem since the cap is what attaches to the keychain. Aside from that, though, they work fine. Great for carrying around in a pocket.",63,2

Most stores in my area are not carrying them so I found these.  Sorry...but I hate them.  They are very small for writing, and since I attach them to my keychain, the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day!  (My other pens never broke, thicker plastic.)  If you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok.  I won't buy these again since I have found the Pentel pens I want on Amazon. Oh, and the chain they come on is a joke, totally worthless.",120,4
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I'll have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion, as described and intended, however I was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket, and it works very well for that. I unscrew the little keychain attachment, and the lid stays on in my pocket so I'm always ready to write in a notebook I carry; I frequently have a better pen, but not always. This one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen, otherwise it's a little too stubby. The product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter, but it works well for what I wanted.",130,5
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Honestly, if I had known the cap would fall or pull off so easily, I never would have purchased this product. I should have looked for push button or twist pens instead. These pens are small, fit well on a keychain, and writes okay, but I almost lost the cap(s) quite a few times. Due to the price point, it's not worth the time returning, but I won't buy again.",70,6

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,Good deal for the number of pens. Definitely wrap a strip of tape around the head of the pen to keep the pen from falling out of the cap if you keep them on your keys/if they will be yanked around a lot.,43,8

Great idea, but not so great product for it's intended use.  I couldn't make any of these pens last more than a week before the pens started falling out of their cap.  With normal use, some of the caps cracked, and some of them just stopped clicking onto the pen.

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I like that these pens all have black ink. The orange, green, etc. ink pens that you find in some of these sets have limited value if you are not a teenage girl. These pens are half the length of typical pens, but you can flip the cap over to lengthen them for comfortable writing. The small size makes these great for carrying in a pocket when you're on the go and the cap style prevents leaking. Construction is cheap and lightweight, but they are a decent value at less than a dollar per pen. The keychains seem pretty flimsy and I discarded them; didn't really want that feature anyway.",110,54

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Maybe I'm just hard on things in my pocket, but these things break very easily.  On every one of them the screw that connects the pen to the key ring pulls out of the cap, stripping the hole.  I've tried using super glue to put it back together which works for a little while.  Also the pen does not stay in the cap very securely.  Much prefer the Nite Ize pocket pen by Inka.",74,57
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These are great for my purposes.  I always need a pen that is easy to carry around and I'm the type that like to carry as little as possible so these are great b/c they fit in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans.  I never noticed them until I need to write something down.  I'm not sure why the description listed the product box with Product Dimensions 6.5 x 2.8 x 0.4 inches but the pens are 3.5 inches long and they are all black ink.  I was worried since the description mentioned Color Red/Blue/Black/Green/Purple but these are describing the color of the casing not the ink.  I needed simple blue or black but cringed at the description of the colors.  I can't believe that I'm excited about pens.,131,58
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"These pens are great for keeping on your lanyard, and are always handy.  Perfect for teachers, and the colors are great, too!",22,59
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,Especially for pre-teens kids B4 their growth spurt. All grandkids enjoy these in their Xmas socks along with a small empty book they can fill with their ideas.,28,60
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"These pens are perfect for attaching to a lanyard so you always have a pen with you. The chains are reasonably strong; I've only had one fall off and that was when it got scrunched in a corner.

The pens are moderately tight in the cap. They don't fall out with normal use, but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be ""friction locked"", allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap.

The pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks, such as writing a signature or jotting down a note. There is no way you would want to use it all day, unless you have small hands.",128,61
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"These pens are not meant for writing papers or business. I gave away as little tokens, and I can tell you that right now my co workers still have these little cute pens hanging from their desks. They are fun, and great since they can be pinned on a refrigerator magnet! They don't write bad either!",56,62
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,I should have bought the retractable kind of mini pen without caps that can be lost.,16,63
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Although the pens write nicely, attaching the keychain to the cap of the pen was a horrible idea. I keep losing the pens throughout the day because they are not designed to stay in the cap under stress.",38,64
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These pens are a great idea but because there is no twist to secure the pen in place it is subject to dislodge  and be lost . Other than that it's a very handy tool .,36,65
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,like the True Utility pen the problem is that taking your keys in and out of your pockets the pen will pop off. I fixed this problem with these buy wrapping a piece of tape (electrical or duct tape) around the part where the cap seats on the pen. now I need to really pull hard so I hopefully won't lose them.,62,66
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love these i got them to make my parents crazy and it worked,14,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Looks real and stays on my lip great! Almost gave my parents a heart attack when I wore it to go eat supper with them. It does stick a little if you use it on your lip because of the moisture from your mouth, also wouldn't suggest eating with one on your lip, food gets stuck on the sliding thing quite easily",62,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are a little thicker than I expected but they work wonderfully!,12,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"They definitely serve their purpose and look realistic! Although they are not made for daily, 24 hour use, they are excellent for pictures and testing to see if you would want a piercing. The colors you receive vary, so don't expect an exact color. I got more pink than I wanted but, I was okay with that. I definitely recommend them.",61,3
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"Pretty,  came 5 days late,but nice two purple three silver.",10,4
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Just don't buy it. It doesn't look real it looks so fake and you don't even get different colors they are all silver and break at the slightest touch.,29,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"I thought I was getting different color hoops,  yet I got all silver and broken hoops. Horrible product, Very disappointed.",20,6

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these were great and look so real but super easy to lose if you're not a very organized person,19,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,The hoops are huge and they did not come in multicolor. All hoops were purple. Way to big to wear anywhere but upper ear lobe.,25,9
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,If you wear it for to long it irritates the skin where it is and it might leave you with a scar but would buy again,26,10
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Work exactly like they say they do. Work well as a faux septum/cartilage piercing, though it was a little too big for my nose to wear it as a nose ring.",31,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"This was an amazing buy. It came in fast and nothing was broken or missing. I received three gold, one red, and one purple. I wore it around town and I had to go to Walmart and my friend saw me and asked if it was real. I didn't want to lie so I said no it's a fake and she said 'it looks good on you' I was quite surprised someone actually thought it was real. I love it, I'm going to buy more and hope for more colors.",90,12
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,I love the prodect. It came early and I love them. I got 4 red ones and 1 blue. I wear them all the time. My friends think that there real when I wear them.,35,13
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,They do not come in all the colors and I only got 4 not bad but still next time I'm going some where else,24,14
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,too big i think for it to pass as a real nose ring,13,15
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"I really like them and use them a lot! I got 2 gold, 1 red, 1 purple, and 1 pink. I was hoping for on to be black but it was fine. Would recommend, doesn't leave a mark but can tend to hurt for a while if you leave on for a pretty long time.",55,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,I love it! It comes with 4 and came really early,11,17
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,These left awful soars on my daughters noise. Way too tight!!,11,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"Arrived a week early which I THOUGHT was kinda nice until I saw the quality of the product itself. It came with only four even though the product clearly says five. And they were all blue, no variety of color there. And they're all broken, either the silver clip part fell out or is jammed open. Honestly the worst purchase I've ever made, I don't even want new ones or anything to do with these guys ever. I would only recommend these to people who want to waste money.",89,19
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"This is a great product! Shipped 2 weeks early and looks real! I got them to feel like I have piercings and to trick my friends because I'm not allowed to have piercings yet. Anyways, this is a great product that looks real! The only problem I have with the product is getting them on. They are so small that it is really hard to get it on your lip in the right place. They are so small you have to practically rip you lip off. But when on they are secure and feel great. Also, if you are like me and are sensitive to certain materials THIS IS FOR YOU I am very sensitive to certain materials and this I was having a reaction to, so be careful. But the product is great and looks real. And the color is fantastic, I got 5 rose gold colored rings. They are beautiful. I can't blame the small size to get on your lip though because it makes the product more secure when on. So overall I am very satisfied and give this product 5 stars.",185,20
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"I absolutely love them, came 7 days early and even though u can not pick the colors I received two red, two pink, and one purple sense I don't fancy pink I just used nail polish and painh the pink ones black and held them till they were dry enough to set down and then when dry I put a clear coat on and they look like they came black. I also altered purple to silver, and then to blue I just used nail polish remover and then changed the color so super simple, and I totally recommend them don't threat if u don't get the right color ",108,21
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"I just got these in today. I've had multiple piercings in the past and my skin always rejected them, so this is a great alternative for me. It came with 1 black, 1 green, 1 pink, and 2 red rings. They are comfortable and easy to use, and look like the real things, great to use as a nose ring, lip ring, or septum ring.",65,22
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,They're a little uncomfortable but they work fine for fake piercings also that you don't chose your own colors which sucks and they took a while to get here but they're good,32,23
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"They came in way before he estimated time slot and every time someone noticed it, they thought it was real. Perfect for pranks, or to see if you want to get the real thing in the future. I am very satisfied even though I only got silver, which, is the color I wanted.",53,24
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,They came in earlier than expected and they feel fine love them,12,25
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"I love these, but I ended up getting all pink. Its a good product, I just wanted silver.",18,26
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,There awesome! They look real and everything but idk if its just me but when i wear they pinch my inner lip like crazy especially when I try to take them off they hurt the inside but other than that there amazing,42,27
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,My clips came a lot sooner than expected and they're comfortable for daily use.,14,28

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I got all silver which i like and they seem pretty sturdy but I'll update when i wear them more,20,30
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Very disappointed. Got 3 pinks 2 silver and a blue? Why wouldn't you give more varied colors.,17,31
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Took less than a month to get here. I got three black, one red and one green. Perfect! I am 100% pleased with my order. They do hurt slightly but it goes away after time, or either with some distraction. I am wearing mine for a septum piercing and I find it will feel better if I take it out and turn it around (so the flat silver part is on the other side of my nose). I have had them for about 3 days and so far no hole in my nose.",93,32
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"i originaly thought they would come in assorted colors, but they all came in this really nice light purple color so im not that upset. as for wearing the actual product itself, it feels a little painful when you wear it for long periods of time. i wore it as a lip piercing and it felt a little weird after an hour or two (i.e; i could talk just fine, but i couldn't drink with a straw because it would shift around uncomfortably), but the feeling's easy to ignore if you distract yourself from it.",95,33
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I wish all the colors that were shown in the picture were what you received. . .,17,34
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,most of them were broken when they came in the mail,11,35
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,You don't get 5 different colors and they break very easy not worth your money!!!!,15,36
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,Highly recommend for anyone not wanting to have to pierce! Looks real and easy to use,16,37
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"One of the worst things I've bought on amazon. Tiny rings, AND NO VARIETY. I read the reviews and they said mostly got silver i'm like oh ok, i'm cool with silver. Nope. I only got all pink..I hate pink. These are completely useless to me, don't waste your money, find another seller.",53,38
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these hurted just a lil but I forgot about it aftrer a while,13,39
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,Just got them I can't wait to trick my dad hahaha,11,40
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they look really cool but they left a scab on the out side of my lip,16,41
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I am so disappointed in these. Not only were they only pink and white when I was led to believe there were multiple colors (Especially what I really wanted which was black) but 3 of them were completely broken and wouldn't spring shut. One of them the inner part was completely out of. Ill be going to a different sender next time...They were cheaply made and way bigger than expected.,70,42
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,Its pretty good. Just hurts after a while.,8,43
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,These are awesome! They look very real and I've been convincing everyone I meet. The only problem is that the rings really pinch your skin but you don't feel it after a while. I also didn't get much color variety. I only received 3gold and 2 black rings. Which is completely fine with me I can't complain because those colors make the rings look even more real but otherwise they're great! I also received it about 3 weeks earlier than expected!,81,44
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I bought some of these and they don't hurt and they did not put a hole on you. No matter where you put them. I wore them all day long on my lip because that's where the original piercing is. And ther was no hole left by these fake ones. The reason I wore this was because I was taking a break from my real piercing's. I was quite comfortable with these and I will buy them again.,78,45
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I only got blue and purple but other than that they are great,13,46
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Slow shipping and it hurts too much when I wear it. And its easy to lose,16,47
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"They're perfect for what I wanted them for, and they look very good. The only problem was that they didn't come in multiple colors, just five blue ones. If the lack of different colors doesn't bother you, then I would definitely recommend these.",43,48
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I ordered these and it took a month and a half and it gave me all 5 blue like not worth it. ,22,49
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Omg, these are great, I really loved them. I've been wanting to get my nose pierced for a long time but been to scared. Lol look real!!!",27,50
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,Though they make a good fake septum piercing...it came with 4 pinks and a red. Was really hoping I would get one in each color...AS ADVERTISED in the picture :(.,30,51
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"It took a while, but i got them. They are easy to use, but i guess it's too big for my lip. I use them as nose piercing. I lost 2, 1 doesn't quite work and the other 2 are the one's that work well. As soon as i got them, i wiped them with rubbing alcohol just in cade",60,52
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,They hurt a tiny bit but I love how they look.,11,53

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they're great! i got them to trick my friends and family. and it worked perfectly! of course i'm gonna use them for everyday use. they do pinch you for a few minutes but it stops after a bit and feels perfectly fine. i gave it 4 stars because i got four silver and one blue.. even though it was supposed to come with a variety of colors. but it's okay! I wanted silver anyway. :),75,56
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"Received 5 of them , one of it was Rusty another one deformed and looking rusty not made for the nose even to small as a use for ears or any else also they all having a dirty silver look no colored ones been packed its just looks old like they been not storaged well or been just laying around ,very disappointed and feel tricked. Don't waste your money and time. Would like to receive my money back.",78,57
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,These earnings are really cute!:) They are a little difficult to maneuver at first but you get the hang of them very quickly. The quality is wonderful for the price. I highly recommend this item.,35,58

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Don't buy!!!!  Came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored.,11,60
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"I recieved 6 but they came in pairs of three colors- Pink, red, and silver. It wasn't a problem however, I wanted silver ones and the price of this was great so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra. They came in a small package, the delivery was fast, and overall I consider this to be a good purchase.",62,61
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,Just got mine in the mail 4 gold 1 silver not the colors I wanted but can easily change the color by using nail polish or markers and they fit perfectly for my nose a bit tight on the lip tho  but works great,44,62

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,This thing is a waste of money doesn't even stay between your breast. Maybe if you are a very large and obese person it might work. I'm small with very large breast this thing was like huge between my breast and kept popping out tried with a bra and with a bra under a tank didn't work,57,0

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,I use this almost every night now. Tip: it stays in place better if you wear a sports bra. I would buy it again.,24,4

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,Not a big help for my big boobs. I'm an H cup and was super hopeful this would help. It doesn't sit right or stay still. I'm like come on my boobs should hold it in but they don't. I missed the free return window bc I went out of town.,51,6
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"Sleep with this every single night, not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs. OMG, so fricking painful!  Anyways, since becoming pregnant, I want to sleep on my side a lot and so I am worried about wrinkles too I guess... but the pain... dear lord, it's so bad. I tried using a pillow, but this just slides in place and stays better... I mean it doesn't even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom!!! Score!",87,7
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Dumbest purchase of my life don't let it be yours. Cheap toy that is worth 50cents at best! I was shocked to say the least. Roll up a towel & use that instead.,33,8
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Doesn't work.. since has no straps the bear won't stay in place so it's useless,15,9

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"It's a bit thicker than expected, I imagine for more generous boobs. But! It's very comfy to jam into my PJ top. Helps with pregnancy sweats and heavy pregnant boobies.",30,11

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"doesn't work very well ,  it is very small , better use as a baby or dog toy .  better to  just use a pillow",25,13
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"I bought this bear on another website.  The other reviewers are right... this would only work well for VERY large boobs.  I bought the isima breast pillow, and that has straps that secure it in place.  Sometimes I put a comfy bra on too (over the pillow) to secure it even more so, and also I like sleeping in comfort bras.  I would recommend the Isima breast pillow!  I have size C implants.",73,14
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"This works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place. My primary complaint is, it doesn't rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts. I'll wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together (the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles) and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still. Need a TIGHT sports bra to hold it in place. At least for me. I'm 5'8"" tall, slim build, with breast augmentation. Might work better for natural breasts. Still use it though, I do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place.",116,15
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product. Works as advertised according to her. She finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place.,39,16

Too bad because it is super cute.",33,19
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"Might work for some, but was too thick for me (natural 34DDD). The bear design is adorable but I went with the Bosom Buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me.",36,20
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,I have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all. Not worth the money!,18,21
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Well damn I missed the return window by a few days.  I have DDs and this thing is too big! It has to be for someone with FFF's. Or someone with Nat Geo tits.,34,22
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"Outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it's pretty useless, unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this doesn't stay put at all.",32,23
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"Love It! After researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles I saw this and thought, Ah Ha! It is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 DDD breast from smushing together. I notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases. Everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place. H&M has great long stretchy tanks I use.",77,24
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"I had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed.  It is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place (even with wearing a sports bra to sleep).  Ultimately, it does not do well what it is advertising to do.",51,25

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,Four stars because thought they'd be bigger .overall there okay . I still need to try them out . So I'll update in a few .,26,4
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Not worth a penny. Sponges broke off handles within days. Don't waste your money.,14,5
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,Good price but not very good quaility. In this sense you kind of get what you pay for. Sponges are very stiff.,22,6
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,"These sponge brushes make blending my facial makeup a BREEZE!  Every time I need to do a heavy contour, I reach for these brushes rather than my beauty blender.  I find this product easier to manipulate.  They are sturdy and well built, and everything arrived intact.

The makeup brush cleaner is also very very useful.  I was easy to see when a brush was truly clean due to the residual makeup being very visible against the purple silicon.

This bundle is a great value for the price and I would definitely recommend this product if you frequently contour or blend your facial makeup!",103,7
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,"Only one of these sponges I was satisfied with and that was the teardrop; the other two seemed a bit flimsy.  When I used the cleaning item that came with the sponges, it tore through the sponges so I am no longer able to use them.  Not very satisfied with this product; wish it was of better quality.",58,8
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like I want,17,9
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,One of the pieces wasn't entirely glues on and broke off when I was applying makeup to it. But everything else was fine,23,10
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Cheap. Handle came out of all of them,8,11
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,Waste of money. Too small to evenly spread anything and soaks up all my product.,15,12
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful. They were smaller than I expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator/ blendor. They get the job done and I love them.,36,13
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,It feel a little to harsh for my face..,9,14
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,brushes are poorly made and fell apart after only using it twice.,12,15
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,cute........they apply concealer very well. no messy fingers...,8,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,It is somewhat a pain to use in that it's sticky and slightly burns upon applying. The color is lovely though and just the 'peeling' aspect is really cool.,29,0
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,Lighter than I expected but I love it !,9,1
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,This stuff doesn't work like I had seen it in makeup reviews.,12,2
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"My lips are stained pink!
So are my teeth
... And my tongue
After brushing my teeth, the toothpaste foam is pink.
My finger tips are also pink.
I would definitely say it does its job.
WARNING DO NOT APPLY ON THE GO! You will stain everything.",47,3
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,I love the color super cute. Does make your lips dry though.,12,4
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,i really liked this product although it looked darker than i expected,12,5
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"interesting! this color is a much darker pink than expected, but it is a pretty pink toned stain.",18,6
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,"This is a fun product. Goes on very sticky.  You wait til it dries and then peel it off.  The longer you leave it on, the darker the shade.  I would say it looks like you've eaten a Popsicle.",39,7
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,Don't buy this! Horribly disappointed. I anxiously applied this and immediately knew I made a bad purchase. Lips stuck together after a length of time given to let them dry. When I separated my lips a stringy blob pulled off of my lips. It was gross. Then it made me wonder what in the world is in this product to make it stringy and blob off.,66,8
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,I got this for myself and it works perfect and it actually came earlier than expected ,16,9
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"Product exactly as expected after watching some YouTube videos of girls reviewing this product. Apply quickly before it starts to dry. Also, make sure like are dry and don't put chapstick on prior or the product doesn't stain as well. Impressed this didn't try out my lips like most lip products do.",52,10
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"I love these. They are really great, they last pretty long and stay even when you eat and drink. They don't leave any marks or anything once you've finished applying it and done it right. However, for me most of it fadeafter about 6 hrs or so though and leaves a thin outline on the edge of my lips but that might be because I often lick my lips. My favorite color is lovely peach if you just want something light but sexy red is also pretty nice if you want a dark red color. Just don't apply it to dry and flaky lips.",104,11
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"This was a pretty fun product and slightly harder to use than regular lip gloss. I had Fun experimenting and applying it, I just had to make sure to get it off my teeth wen I was done. However since I did get it close to my lip color I had to apply it twice to notice a difference and use some pretty thick coats to cover up my lip well. Its a good lip tint and my lips look great but still had to put on clear chapstick since it kinda dried up my lips. Would buy again :)",100,12
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,"This just didn't work for me on any level.  I've heard alot about this type of gloss and looked forward to giving it a try.  I followed the directions and put the gel on my lips.  It was difficult to apply evenly and was very thick and sticky.  After leaving it on for some time I tried to peel it off, but nothing really peeled, it just was stuck and I ended up having to wash it off with a washcloth.  What I was left with was no visible difference in color whats so ever. I was pretty disappointed and this ended up in the trash.",106,13
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,I would give no stars if possible.  Extremely messy and difficult to apply.  It is very sticky and getting an even application is next to impossible. I threw it away.,30,14
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,"Absolutely useless. The gel is sticky, clumpy and so thick it pops the applicator off every time you try to use it. There's no way to even spread it so it can dry to peel off. Extremely disappointed.",38,15
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"Im kind of 50/50 for this lipstain. I like the fact the last long in ur lips and doesn't dry out my lips. Its a great idea. The only problem is very hard to apply, sticky and messy. It difinitely need some time to get used to it. This is good if ur not in hurry and had plenty of time since it take time to get the product to dry so u can peel them off. Overall I would buy it again.",83,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"Love it! It's weird to apply at first, and it's pretty goopy. But once you've gotten the hang of it, it's amazing! Dries out your lips (what lip stain doesn't) so have chap stick ready to apply after. The watermelon color is more red than I had expected. Lovely peach is a nice, light pink. Just bought another in the peach color!",62,17
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,Don't buy this cheap TERRIBLE LIP GLOSS. ITS THE WORSE !!  it's doesn't even apply to my lips. It's like plastic in a tube. Absolutely terrible,26,18
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,This stuff is so gooey it's hard to keep it on your lips for more than 30 seconds.  It feels gross and doesn't really peel off.,26,19
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,too dry on my lips. difficult to apply. and it barely shows.,12,20
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,to hard to get on straight..needs a better applicator,9,21
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,"This applies horribly, burns the lips, and is just gloppy. It doesn't ever dry to peel off, and is so gelatin like that it is next to impossible to spread over the lips.",33,22
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,The peach is a little lighter than I expected more of a very light pink it's a little messy but once you get  the consistency right it peels off easy and lasts all day and it's easy to remove I just scrub my lips and it comes off when I don't want the color any more,56,23
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Nice! I really like it, but unfortunately, it is a bit messy when applying. But other than that, it is great!",21,0
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I did not like it my teeth became pink,9,1
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Took about 25 day to get here. I love the Cherry Red color!,13,2
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"It really lasts so I love it. It can withstand food, drinks, washing, rubbing, etc. It lasts on my lips for more than 24 hours so it's worth a shot!",30,3
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Nothing looks like what I saw in YouTube/Facebook,8,4
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Doesn't peel off well. Gets stain all over fingers. Light color stays on for few hours at most. Not worth the money. Sadly a disappointment. It did make for a funny facebook live post, because it doesn't work like it should.",41,5
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"I did not like the tint color, it was too light, the lipstick stain didn't lady as promised.",18,6
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,these are great before going out to a big event! its very pigmented and it will literally stay on ALL day! I usually apply mine with just a little lip brush and let it dry completely before peeling it off! the color lasts all day without having to worry about reapplying anything else.,53,7
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Its not long lasting at all, once you drink or eat , it just disappear",15,8
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,It wasn't a rich red like the advertisements show. Also would horribly stain my teeth.,15,9
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,The top almost popped off at first use. The applicator part had a rough piece of plastic so couldn't smooth it onto my lips. Super funny texture and unfortunately left a weird color. I really wanted to like it but it was horrible on all accounts,46,10
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I bought two different colors of these. I am that girl that HATES wearing stuff on my lips and reapplying throughout the day. These are great! I use a small lip brush to apply that I bought cheap from CVS. Make sure your lips are mosturized before using. Apply it slowly covering lips and don't close your mouth and let lips touch until dry. It will look funny but don't worry! I let it dry for about 5-10 minutes then peel off! It looks great! I sometimes put Chapstick over top of it if I want that shiny gloss look. After about 6 hours it starts to wear off for me but it will be different for everyone. I love these for nights out or events where I don't want to keep reapplying lipstick. Plus my husband loves it bc he can kiss me without transfer and I can eat and drink with no problem. Last pic I posted was after 4 hours of it on and eating lunch (cherry red was applied that day)

I recommend to all the lazy girls that still wanna look great ",187,11
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"This does what it is supposed to do. Note that if your skin is dry, peeling off this lip treatment may hurt a bit, so I just rubbed with tissue paper.",31,12
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Love the color of this product! I just don't like how its hard to get on evenly.,17,13
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"The stain did not work for me, but it worked for my mother. I'm confused on the product.",18,14
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"It worked,  kind of.. It didn't Peel well.. Was to thin to grab easy and color wiped mostly off after and the rest only lasted an hr or 2. Color was pretty and it was  cheap.",36,15
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it does what a stain does in the begging a little goes along way .  once you get to the end then its a little stickier but overall pretty good,30,16
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"It's very pigmented,.. Really hard to put on, its sticky and takes a long time to put on. But overall its really good i like it..",26,17
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Very hard to apply.  Very hard to wait 20 minutes for the tint to dry.  The tint also did not actually peel off, but I had to rub it and finally rub a damp towel over my lips to get off all the pieces.  The color was lighter than I expected and it was not long lasting.",57,18
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"It is impossible to get a clean line. The container was approximately 25% full so you had to tip the head back and tube upright in order to get the goo out, thus no mirror view because you are looking at the ceiling.

Took over a month to arrive and it totally sucked- it deserves no stars.",57,19
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,It doesnt go on easily too clumpy and stiky,9,20
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Takes to long to work, then just looks like I ate something red.",13,21
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Shipping took like a month and it does not work good, it doesnt stay that long, it taste nasty, you're better  off buying a lipstain",25,22
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Cool idea but deff not as easy to put on as we see in videos...ends up on teeth n stains your fingers....but does leave a nice stain on lips when everything else is cleand up,35,23
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"I love the idea of waterproof lipstick that doesn't get on anything, but this one does. It was soo liquidy, pretty sure that's not how it is supposed to be and the top part was torn off, but I fixed that. After a long time of keeping it on my lips, I pealed it and the lipstick didn't take affect at all. I was really disappointed. This is not how it's advertised.",72,24
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,My daughter uses this occasionally and likes it,8,25
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip. and gets on teeth when I smile,23,26
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Cute color and staun, but is really messy.",8,27
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,eh.  there are much better brands.  this is loaded with chemicals and i can't help but feel like i am doing my body a disservice.  it takes a lot of time and patience to get on evenly and just isn't worth it.,42,28
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit...this brand peels off nicely,18,29
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I bought two of these the red one is completly unusable. It's so clumpy does not go on smooth.  The taste of this product is gross. I would not buy again.,31,30
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Owmygee! My liptint arrived this morning and it's so nice. It look so good on my lips  So happy for this product. Surely gonna get another one. ,27,31
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I loved this product it works quickly and almost instantly at first I didn't know if this was the peel off one but it was and it stayed in for te whole day I strongly recommend this,37,32
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,It was in perfect condition when I recieved it and it arrived like a week sooner than expected. The color is just what I wanted and really lasts all day. I love it.,33,33
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I like the product, but I do recommend using a lip brush rather than just the squeeze tube for a more precise and even application.",25,34
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,It is super messy to put on and really really sticky. I had to apply it like every hour because the color came off very quickly and the my upper lip didn't not get the same color my bottom lip did. Very sad it doesn't work on my skin =(,50,35
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"These are not meant  for tan to dark skin ladies. I think my lips are somewhat dark, so you can barely see the color on my lips. I picked out the darkest shade too but it's still too light for a tan girl like me.",45,36
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Love the color and its final look. A little bit sticky when putting on, but easy to peel of (don't hurt at all). Highly recommended. Took 1 month to arrive.",30,37
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Don't waste your money. This stuff is horrible- it got all over the place and stains everything (fingers, teeth, cabinets). Consitancy of product is awful- has huge globs that come out. Seriously- don't waste your money.",36,38
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I love this product . It was super new. The shipping was way faster than I had thought it would be . The product got here in perfect shape. Overall the lip colored stayed on all day . I would recommend you to buy this!!!!,45,39
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Applying lipsticks wouldn't be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo.,11,40
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"This is a terrific little addition to the make-up case. It's a little challenging to use the first time but after some trial and error it works great.

First you should use a cotton swab to apply it, this gives you a lot more control which is important as this is intended to stain and does.

It takes a while to dry and you must keep your mouth open or you'll have a mess on your hands. Cotton balls under your tongue help help with the extra saliva, not attractive but effective.

You can also use a hair dryer to speed up the process, however the longer it stays on the better the results.

Interpreting it off use a nail brush to scrub your hands if you keep coconut oil on hand it works great for removal.

On average the color lasts around 8-10 hours with eating, drinking, and smoking.

I've recommended this to several friends and my sister and will definitely be purchasing more.",165,41
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,Terrible ! It feels like chalk on your lips ,9,42
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Just received mine, was very excited I'm not allergic to anything. Put this product on my lips it's was burning and made my lips swollen
Will never try this product again",31,43
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I love it!!! I ordered the cherry red. It is so pretty and peeling it off was oddly fun and satisfying. It came super early and in great condition. It is a little smaller than I thought but it's worth it. The application was fairly easy and it looks kinda messy but the end result is gorgeous!!!,57,44
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Seems like it would work really well, but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency",19,45
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect.,12,46
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Too thick to put on properly. Was hard to get out of the bottle. The top is poorly made so if you have to push hard enough to get the product out, (which comes out in a giant messy blob) it popped off and stained my nails and hands. Worst mess I ever paid for. And if you get your lips wet the stain never stops rubbing off. It stains your lips but it is a dry mess. Also don't use with your favorite lip gloss. It will put the color all over your wand.",95,47
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"This product is alright. It does drain the lips.. However, it goes on clumpy and sticky, and it looks like you became a vampire and have blood on your lips. It takes forever to dry and it doesn't peel off like it's supposed to. I would NOT recommend it. Also, if you have cuts on your lips, it may burn. Use with caution.",63,48
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I'm pretty satisfied with this product. :) It is a bit tricky to apply b/c it's gooey, so you have to apply in a quick swift motion. I watched a tutorial on an application suggestion & that helped. I left it on for 10 min. & it dried with awesome results. It delivered a nice deep cherry red. It even stayed on even after eating dinner. I would buy this again!",71,49
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"It works really well! easy to apply if you just take your time, and lasts a long time. It also came earlier than expected.",24,50
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"It looks like I drank some cherry kool-aid and it stained my lips red. It's nearly impossibly to get it all the same shade.. it's super splotchy. Plus you cannot stay in the lines of your lips well at all, and it takes like 30 minutes to fully dry. Definitely not an on the go lip color, you need a mirror and about 30 minutes to apply and let dry. Not impressed at all.",74,51
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Overall the color lasts a long time on your lips but it takes a long time for the product to dry on your lips and after you peel it off (which is a mess) it just looks like I've had a glass of red kool-aid.,45,52
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"highly recommended , its not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil, aloe, natural fruit essence and also with vitamin E.
I have very sensitive lips so I choose the lipstick that i am using..
jeny!",39,53
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,It's thick and messy;impossible to apply properly the way you would any other lipstick or lipstain; there are much better choices.  I would not buy it again,27,54
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I love this product! I got it in Cherry Red and the finish was like a beautiful bright red lipstick, and it's a pretty good sized tube. I've only had it on for about an hour but it has not come off at all, and it feels like you have nothing on. My only issue was that some of it was leaking out of the sides, of the top, but it didn't drip on anything or make a mess when applying so it wasn't a big deal. I've been trying out different lip stains to recommend one to my best friend for her upcoming wedding, and this is definitely at the top of the list!",115,55

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,I got the cherry red. I really like its color. The longer you have it on the darker it gets. I really like it a lot.,26,57
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"I think mine came defective. The gloss came out of the tube extremely thick, almost like old glue. It was virtually impossible to apply. The color is pretty in the end, but the mess is not worth it.",38,58
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,So although it is messy to apply it really works and does not leave lips dry just put some chapstick after application and your lips will look beautiful :),29,59
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Zero stars. I wasn't happy with it at all. I first seen it on Facebook and it looked like something i would like, but no. I was safly wrong. Came late, hard to put on, dries way to fast, and it doesn't taste very good.",45,60
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,It provides long lasting color and safety on my lips every time I use it.,15,61

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"A great value and a terrific color payoff. To be honest the only issue I had was waiting for the product, because it did arrive a month late. Which doesn't surprise me since it only cost 3$",37,66
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I received it today and tried it on and live it perfect color it looks great,16,67
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Pros: works really, really well. I applied it last night around 8 pm to try it out, peeled it off and was left with a beautiful stain. Didn't bother washing it off before bed and woke up this morning with beautiful lips! And no transfer on my pillow either

Cons: it tastes REALLY bad. Like...there is something extremely bitter in the gloss before you peel it off and if you don't get all the pieces off right away it lingers on your lips and has a horrible bitter taste. But I mean, it isn't meant to be ingested or licked like a lip gloss is so maybe that was my fault.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Shipping was decent. I ordered it the 26th of December and got it on the 4th of January.",135,68

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"I like the fact that this lip tint gives you a vibrant natural rid lip tint. It smells good but taste horrible. Im glade I bought it, it works with every skin tone including women of color. Ladies I recommend this product!",42,76
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,Could not stand the feel of it while it was drying. It grossed me out.,15,77
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Do not use this unless you have a very steady hand and are possibly a professional makeup artist. My sister gave me some and I thought it was lip gloss. Got some out of the lines as it were and yes, it definitely lasts. My hands and lips and in general the lower half of my face have been bright red for hours now. If you can get it where you want it Im sure it would be a lasting and lovely lip color. But you really need to get it on perfect the first time, or you end up looking like a toddler who ate a crayon.",108,78
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"It's a really cool concept. The application however is a mess. I would recommend using a QTip or lip gloss applicator versus just using it directly from the tube. The stain doesn't turn out that red once it is peeled off, it honestly looks like you just ate a Popsicle. So if you're into that look, this product is for you. Overall it requires too much time to put on. I have used it twice in the year that I have had it.",83,79
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,Does not seem to be something i would wear long time and the material doesnt seem to stay on or look a certain way,24,80
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED IN MY LIFE! Not only is this a sloppy mess that doesn't really work but it BURNS to put on,26,81
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Love my new nail polish ! Essie have a great selection of shades and I am very glad they  have this one back.,23,0
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Great color, but horrible formula!  It goes on thick and gloppy like a polish that has been sitting on a shelf for years. I expected more from Essie.",28,1
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"I love this color. I've heard a lot of complaints about the formula, so I was worried when I ordered it, but the bottle I got is a nice formula. It's not jelly-like, not thick. It's great.",37,2
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,I love the color and the consistency was OK for me but it doesn't wear well at all. I've worn it twice and both times it chipped almost immediately. I've only had it on for 36 hours and it looks like it has been on for a week...it is so chipped. This is not my usual experience with Essie polishes.,60,3
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"I had the original Chanel Ciel de Nuit back in the 90s and loved the color. I never had the original Essie Starry Starry Night, but I bought the revival today, and like all Essie polishes, I loathe the formula. They're always streaky and clumpy, and the brush is too small and hard to control. Color payoff is good after two coats, not as sparkly as the old Chanel it knocked off, but I wouldn't re-buy. About once a year, I buy an Essie polish, and then remember why I hate them. I should stick to Zoya.",97,4
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,All the colors are great but this one was the best.,11,5
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"I am sure the formula is great but the color just didn't work for me.  It was very shimmery and almost had a multi-color sheen to it.  Even my 2 14 yol twin daughters said it was ""too young"" for them.  However, I am sure someone else will love this color!  I had really hoped it would be kind of a blush-champagne color which it looked like in pix. (my bad)",71,6
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Beautiful color but chips after two days, even with expensive base and top coat.",14,7
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Well, it's a pretty color but that's about it. Chipped of the first day and the gel formula was very difficult to work with.",24,8
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,The color is amazing!!! I just love it! so glad it came back,13,9
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,Do NOT buy. Nail polish bottles arrived broken with nail polish coating EVERYTHING. AND they won't honor a return.,19,10
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Such a great color and really good coverage for a polish with glitter.,13,11
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"Great color, but chips way to easy. I do wash hands a lot but not long lasting.",17,12
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"Love Essie polish. This particular mix is pretty thin, but a couple of coats once dry is super cute. Will be using for the rest of the summer.",28,13
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,The consistency was too tacky and it was not as shimmery as advertised. I believe the original formula was better. However one coat was OK for my toes.,28,14
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"I don't know why Essie comes up in the 'luxury' category. I've never liked this polish; the colors are mostly bland, it chips quickly. Really this stuff is overpriced. It's not terrible but it's not high quality either",38,15
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,Very pretty color.  Perfect for a suttle look.,8,16
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Chipped within 3 hours of a professional manicure.  Would not recommend.  I am not a fan of Essie nail polish, especially after buying this.",24,17
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"I love Essie! Their nail polish is one of the smoothest applications I've found. The color has always been one of my favorite. It is light yet striking. I am normally not a fan of light colors but  This one has always been elegant, sophisticated, and timeless. I am so happy to have the color back on The market .",60,18
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"first essie polish of mine and i must say, besides the formula being a bit thick, its a great polish overall <3",22,19
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"I have no issue with the coverage or consistency. I took the polish to my favorite salon and had them do it. However, I'm 26 and I think the color is too blue for me. Maybe for New Years or Vegas. But for work...it's a little much. Looks like what a 16 year old would wear to a dance. Pretty, but not for every day wear.",66,20
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Got the nail polish when they said I would and it is great! Love the color and the ease of putting it on.,23,21
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"It certainly isn't identical to the original, but it is still a great polish! Semi-sheer gelly layer with slightly chunky square glitter, it does resemble a night sky, in a van Gogh kind of way--in that way, this one is probably more appropriately named than the original! Lasted a normal amount of time, and no staining.",56,22
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,Great color. I really like it. The only bad thing about glitter polish is the removal. I hate it.,19,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,They were given as gifts. They loved them,8,24
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Not at all what I expected. It's not navy or dark blue, it is very much a bright royal blue. And I guess all the sparkles in the polish adhere to the glass bottle or get completely buried under the blue, because there were little to no sparkles on my nails.

If I had known this, I would not have bought it, because I've never used it.",67,25
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Very thin formula, it takes way too many coats for it to even look like you have nail polish on. I would not recommend purchasing this one unless you want to go for a more natural look.",37,26
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,Very clumpy and goopy. Did not go on smoothly. Only used once.,12,27
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Not what I was expecting at all. Usually Essie colors are true to color, this is one exception. Once applied the color is iridescent, with a lot of yellow / greens tones and even with three coats, it's still translucent. I have a few other colors from this Retro Revival line and love them but this one is not worth the almost $9.00 I paid.",65,28
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Love this color! even more beautiful in person :},9,29
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,Either I received the wrong item or they are knowingly sending out something completely different. I received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them. No flowers or leaves at all and the beads don't even look like the little ones in the picture either so I'm getting a refund for this disappointment.,54,0
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,"When I ordered these, the description said silver. The ones I got were gold. They have since changed the description. Still, I was not happy.",25,1
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"The gold on these pins is VERY yellowy gold. I initially didn't like the color at all, but they ended up being pretty in my hair so I wore them anyway for my wedding.",34,2
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"Bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding. The pins looked very cute, I wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette, and I gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well. The pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding. Great product for a good price",66,3
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold.
overall, it looked great and is reusable.",26,4
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"I'm actually pretty happy with these! They are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I'm not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy, but overall it's not a huge issue. They still look so pretty! I used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well. I plan to use them for my wedding now as well. I do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well, but I couldn't find them anywhere.",89,5
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,I was looking forward to these and in the silver/white version and instead I got this ugly yellow gold color. Disappointed. Will not use these.,25,6
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,I got these to match my jewelry and Maid of Honor and they were perfect! I loved them and they stood out nicely against my blonde hair. They stayed in really well throughout the night and I got multiple compliments on them,42,7
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,"These hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day! During my trial, my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle. I bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair. We decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive. These hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost. I definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day!",103,8
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,The metal had a cheap look to it. Didnt end up wearing it.,13,9
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,They are very beautiful and of good quality. Unfortunately I only received 2 out of the 3 pins. The package looked like it had been returned. Overall beautiful.,28,10
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,2.0,negative,The gold is very cheap looking. I wanted these for my wedding but they look bad.,16,11
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,I ordered these for my wedding day and they worked great.  Easily adjustable to perfect your look and such a nice but simple embellishment.,24,12
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,"the gold color is very gold, almost cartoonish gold. but I have dark hair, and the accent color for my wedding is gold, so it'll work out fine. but it was a bit of a shock when I first saw it. quality product.",43,13
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,The gold reminded me of Willy Wonka gold.,8,14

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"Leaves a small green lining on your fingers but that should be expected for how cheap it is, the green isn't even noticeable if you leave the rings on, and one did break within 2 weeks sadly but I'm still loving the others.",43,2
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"I would have gave it five stars but one of the rings bent, not that it was a problem because I fixed it like that. But still not the best quality.",31,3
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Just like a set of forever 21 rings,8,4

Worth the money by far!",15,5

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,The rings snapped easily and the midi rings weren't very adjustable.,11,10
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,"I totally thought these would be cute for the summer/pool/beach. I would not want to take these in the water. The paint on it is all chipped and cracking.  There were 2 pieces that had jagged metal sticking out from the ring area.

3 pieces were adjustable and 3 were not. The ones that were not adjustable fit on my knuckles and we're not comfortable.

The metal is garbage. The paint is chipping and the sizing is weird. I might be able to use a couple as toe rings. Not worth what I paid for them.",96,11
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Came in as pictures the material isn't flimsy cute rings,10,12
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,They are made out of plastic. reminds me of costume jewelry for a 4 year old.,16,13
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"So I received my rings early, which was a big plus. They came in a small package and I was very pleased to see that they were perfect, although the rings seem to have the black paint chips, or something like that, stuck on the inside.",46,14
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,"They're cute, they're super affordable, they are just little trinkets after all. I got mine to hopefully spruce up some shots of manicures/nail art I'm doing. For me, not to wear for real :)",34,15
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,Poorly made broke as I put them on the first time. Cute style it it was made out of something else. Don;t waste your money.,25,16
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"Only one of them broke and I didn't like that one anyway lol. They're surprisingly sturdy for what you're paying. They're all different sizes. After a while, the color starts to get a little coppery. These rings are pretty good for the price.",43,17
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,"I like them, but they came it says it came in from Wish.",13,18
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,These are okay.. cheap metal so potential breaking.,8,19
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"These are really cute. They kind of bend, but it doesn't seem to be a bad thing. One of them bent almost all the way open while I was running around at work but it didn't break. As far as accent rings go they serve their purpose. Paint them with clear nailpolish so the won't make your fingers green.",59,20
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,"These rings are a cute design BUT the quality is that of a quarter prize machine at a grocery store, Save your money and wrap tinfoil around your fingers.",29,21
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,"These rings are very cheap. The metal is almost plastic-like. The designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped. Only three of the six were sanded, leaving sharp burs on the other three. I am dissapointed, but contented with the few rings of the set I can wear. I would still buy from this seller, as their service is wonderful and everything else I've bought from them has been excellent.",76,22
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,I was so excited when I received these. They are such a cute design. But they are so poorly made that one of them broke at a weak welding/soldering point less than 3 hours after putting it on.,38,23
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Plastic like.. Not what I expected. Most of them broke. You get what you pay for,16,24
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,Love these little rings BUT you get what you pay for. All the open/adjustable rings break within the first two wears. The solid bands are a bit stronger. Realize these are a trendy short term accessory.,36,25
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,very very poor quality. All the rings broke and crumbled after 2 days,13,26

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Nice for the price!! Some of the colors are pretty much the same, so I'm giving a few away as a gift to a friend. Feels good on lips not too glossy and not too heavy. Some do have ""a shimmer"" which I don't prefer, but can deal with. They did come early in mail, but still took 3 1/2 wks to arrive. Overall, I'm happy with purchase.",68,1
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,I'm not really pleased with it.  My lipsticks were smashed and the entire caps were smeared with lipstick. All the colors look the same.  Also this product smells very weird!!,30,2
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,I received my order way sooner than I expected to. This was def worth the buy! I am a caramel African American and all of the colors showed up great on me.

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"I like how smooth they are. The lipstick does slide out if tilted down. For the price they are great, pretty colors, cute design and overall quality of the lipstick and how it feels and looks is good.",38,4

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Greatest cheapest lipstick bundle EVER!! All colors are true to picture. My favorite is the most orangeish color!!

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,"Okay, so I was excited to receive these, and then I swatch them and they're all almost the same color. The orange and red are almost the same and ll the pinks are similar. I don't know which is which. Oh, and I received two 08's. They didn't come too clean. Like the caps had a bit of lipstick residue on them. They are really small. They're not drying though, they are creamy. I just hope none of them break when applying. However, I'm not too pleased.",87,21

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,"My order still says that the earliest it will arrive is Feb 26th, but here it is on the 25th, which is nice. The lipsticks are creamy and soft on my lips and that makes me happy. They were all pretty colors, but I guess because I'm dark they don't transfer so well but whatever! I'm happy to have them either way. They aren't super pigmented when applied, but that might be because of my skin. The colors I wore were 10 (first pic) and 13 (second pic)

Edit: I've concluded last night that some are more pigmented than others (aka the light pinks)",104,27
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,These lipsticks were very cheap. I used one once and it broke right off and the other have been very hard and don't apply very well. I wouldn't recommend this product at all.,33,28

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,My hair is quite short so I use this on my top layers with much success. On the shorties underneath I still have to hit it with the flat iron. As my hair grows back out to chin length I look forward to only needing this brush. It's quicker and effective.,51,1
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Purchased this about 2 weeks ago and needed to give a review on it. I really like it a lot. Its a great addition to my styling products.

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Heavy and awkward to use.  You almost cannot use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings.  It does make a little difference but not enough to really notice.  The bristles will scratch your neck if not careful.  Would not buy again.,43,8
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"I really like this brush. And despite the fact that my hair is short, it still worked quite well. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",25,9
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"The product inside the box seemed like a duplicate brush. Did not have the temperature indicator on it. PLUS, did not even work when plugged in.",26,10
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Hair doesn't get as straight as advertised. It seems to snag African American hair.,14,11
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,Unbelievable piece of junk! I used it maybe six times. I wrote them and explained the condition of their product to them and they ignored me.,26,12
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,Tangles hair too much other than that great product,9,13
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,This Hair Brush did not work for me and I would like to send it back.,16,14
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"I was not sure this would work since I have extremely thick curly hair, so here it goes.  It does work! I let my hair dry naturally, and used the Ionic hair brush.  It really did work but not as well as my flat iron.  The pros is that is great for touch ups and it is easy to use.  This will be my everyday straightening tool, but when I want pin straight hair, I will continue to use my flat iron.  The Cons is that my daughters have already taken it over and I may have to order another one for myself.",103,15
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Love this product! It heats quickly, easy to use and provides great results.  Worth the price!",16,16
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Too heavy and bulky and I've burnt myself several times using it. I only used it 4 times...now it's collecting dust.,21,17
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,It works a bit better than I expected still experimenting,10,18
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,Great for straightening your hair.  I use a comb just to get tangles out prior to the use but like it better then a flat iron.,26,19
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,Like it just not pleased with the number of the heat. Overall it's good.,14,20
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,Didn't work and my hair isn't even curly.  Just wanted it to smooth.,13,21
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,Works good on hair that's not TOO naturally curly!!,9,22
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"This brush works amazing on my course dry hair!!!!!  I only need to run it thru once, and move to the next section of hair!!!
There is 1 draw back, the buttons to raise and drop the temp are on the side where your fingers are when using it.",49,23
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"Easy to use and I get great results which is important to me since I have very coarse, frizzy, kinky, unmanageable hair!",22,24
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,It was a gift for our daughter. She tried it but it didn't work on her hair. It left it as frizzy as it was before she started.,28,25
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"It really works great, but the only problem I have is the buttons should be in a different place because I held it I was also either adjusting it up or down and off because my hand presses the buttons as I held it to do my hair. other then that I do like it.",55,26
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Not impressed. I have short hair with swoopy ends. The brush is not able to do my ends at all.,20,27
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Perfect!! It is a bit difficult to use on shorter hair, but I did expect that.",16,28
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Not happy with the quality of this product at all. And being I paid so much for it makes me even the more unhappy..,24,29
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"I ended up returning it.  It was so big and bluky, and it did not stop the frizz.  It actually made my hair more frizzy.  BUT - the company was really great with my return and if you have thick hair, this would probably be perfect!",46,30
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,I am so happy that I bought this.  It really does straighten your hair and is so much less time consuming than a hair straightener.,25,31
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"It's an excellent concept, but this brush just doesn't get hot enough to do my hair and I had it maxed at 415. I have thick, long and kind of wavy hair and when I read the manual for the recommended heat and I had it maxed at 415 and it took a good 10+ times through the same section to get it even mildly straight. Plus, I believe it states that it's static free? Def not.",77,32
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,I had some difficulty using the brush if my hair wasn't 100% dry and tangle free.  When using the brush I kept touching the temperature controls and changing the temperature. I got this brush so that I could straiten my hair everyday but it's a bit to difficult to do that.,51,33
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,It takes half the time to straighten my hair and not get burned !!!!!!,14,34
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"Good morning, i live in brasil and i boughy on My vacation.  After30 days , its broken and o use only 3 /4 times. I sent this product to my son , he lives um USA! Is ir possble to change ?",42,35
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,Works great! My daughter has curly hair and this straightened it qith minimal frizz.,14,36
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,I purchased 3.  Two for me and 1 as a gift....I hope it works.  But I used mine 1 time each.  They both stopped working.  AMAZON REFUNDED my money and I bought a better unit!!! Thanks AMAZON!,37,37
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,"I was really disappointed in this hot hair brush ... The power button is right in the middle of the handle where your hand naturally is placed when using the brush, so you are constantly turning it off -- super poor design.  I had been looking for a brush that was actually a hot tool rather than just a hot air brush, but I noticed that it took way more effort to straighten my long thick hair with this than with a flat iron.  It would not tolerate very much hair in the bristles, which is discouraging because the brush head is rather large.  Even after straightening with a flat iron, using the brush to give it some lift, body &/or curl, I just couldn't make it happen without investing much more time than I had patience.",137,38
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,It broke one week later when my aunt used it. It's basically a blowdryer,14,39
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,Gave as a gift. Didn't get hot enough,8,40
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Very very dim. Also, the color temperature of the lights are cool blue. Wish I could return.",17,0
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"This is such an awesome idea! I don't have a real makeup vanity to put everything on and also do my makeup. I hung this on the wall right next to where I have my makeup stored and it is perfect for doing my makeup or eyebrows. It has a light so it's very easy to see. The one side is magnified so it is easy to see when you are plucking eyebrows, or eyeliner. I put it up so the installation is very easy. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",99,1
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"The amount and quality of the light provided by the thin strip that encircles the mirror is inadequate. A good source of light from somewhere else close to your face is needed. The hardware works well, easy installation, looks stylish, useable area of mirror on the small side.",48,2
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"Just like in the hotel. Very nice and makes me feel pampered. No more leaning way over the counter to see in the mirror and I love that it pushes back out of the way. I would recommend this mirror. Lights up nicely.
I did receive a discount to review this item and this is my honest opinion not biased.",60,3
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"Supporting hardware does not seem very sturdy but it works very well.  Mirror functions perfectly.  My problem is the lighting which I needed for shaving in a dark location.  I could use a brighter light, hence a 4 vs 5.  Batteries were not difficult to install.  Overall a goodproduct .",50,4
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,Disappointed.  When I pull it out to use it will not stay in place.,14,5
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Terrible product. The quality of this mirror is awful. I bought this after my old wall-mounted mirror fell and broke, and I thought the light would be great. The light flickers and won't stay on, and even for the few moments it is on, it is so dim it is worthless. I have taken it apart twice and replaced the batteries (not easy to do either) and no improvement. The mirror surface is also pretty small and magnification is not good. I tried emailing the seller twice to see if my unit was just defective but they never bothered to reply.",101,6
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,I love this mirror. I didn't want to spend a ton. It does exactly what I need it to. Looks great too!,22,7
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Wall extension seems flimsy but I never got far enough to find out.  The battery case extremely difficult to twist open; once it is, the edges of the open case are sharp. (Yep, it cut me)  Returned for refund.",39,8
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror was easy to install and works fine, but the reason we bought it was the lighting. The LEDs are very dim and almost useless.",26,9
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,Mine appears to be defective. Needed a wrench to screw the part that holds on the mirror. I couldn't do it myself. Also very difficult to take the mirror apart for battery installation.,33,10
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for, but two weeks into ownership one of the brackets on one of the hinges broke. There really isn't kind of hack or easy fix either, appears to be shoddy materials and/or manufacturing.",43,11
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,item was what i wanted and worked great,8,12
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"Broke rivit , so need to send back!",8,13
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"The screw jackets are hard to install but I don't fault the manufacturer for that, I think its my walls. Overall great purchase!",23,14
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror is just fine, however, the perimeter light is so soft or 'low' that it's pointless.  Don't buy this product for the light feature, you'll be disappointed.",28,15
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,The mirrors and extension are great.  The light is worthless.,10,16
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,Got this for my 92 year old Dad so he can see better to shave. works well and arrived on time.,21,17
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,Now I can see myself without my glasses !,9,18
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror is far too heavy for the extension arm and it's very wobbly.  I could never get the mirror case open to insert batteries, so I can't rate the usefulness of the lighted feature.",35,19
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,Good quality mirrors; both the plain and magnifying sides... Good quality construction... The light leaves something to be desired...,19,20
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"very flimsy and takes a long time to balance , also poor lighting",13,21
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,Great mirror.  The light is worthless.  Don't buy it if you need a light.,14,22
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Light is not bright, magnification not good. Will give away",10,23
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Impossible to open the mirror to install the batteries.  I guess I have to return it.
Worthless.",17,24
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,Works for our small bathroom. Not as bright as I hoped.,11,25
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"It was a bit hard to open to get the batteries in but once done, the light is really quite bright. Not sure why others said the opposite. Installation was very easy and it seems well made. Not at all flimsy.",41,26
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"This product is heavy as it is expected to be, but the screws and the mounts they give you need to be better. I have this horrible fear that the cheap drywall screws that came with it are going to break and I am going to end up with 7 years bad luck. The mirror is beautiful though and the led is just bright enough that I can use it and not be blinded by it like some mirror lights. Overall I probably would buy it again , I'd just invest in a better mounting screw set",97,27
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,The LED light isn't as strong as it sounds like it should be. The construction isn't all that sturdy either. The mirror part is wobbly and I'm always afraid it's just going to fall off onto the floor.,38,28
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,This mirror works great! The light is not too bright.,10,29
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,This has never worked. The switch is bad and it will occasionally flicker but will not stay on.,18,30
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"All in all it's decent for what it mainly is, a mirror. The magnification is exactly what I was looking for. The light was a perk, but it's not very bright and really doesn't light up anything extra that my bathroom light doesn't. So I don't really use it.

The arm is a little loose from where it attaches to the wall. It swings slowly back towards the wall, but this could be from how it's mounted? But basically it works just fine for what I need it for!",89,31
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"The quality of the wig is outstanding and the style is very similar to the picture with a little trimming/thinning/styling. There is a lot of hair, evenly distributed through the lace cap and has sewn in clips to attach with ease. It was a little large at the top of the wig and it was very easy to sew a few tucks to take out some of the bulk.

The write up clearly states the color may be different than what is in the picture due to the monitor or lighting. The wig I see on my screen looks like a light brown with blonde highlights. The wig I received is the color of the highlights in the picture and is more blonde than light brown. If you are looking for light brown with blonde highlights, you may be disappointed. I like to play with different wig colors and styles and I am ok with the color. At this price you are getting a quality product and really can't go wrong, unless you aren't willing to do a little trimming or accept a slightly different color.",186,0
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"The color IS darker than expected, with an auburn tint, so it didn't look quite right.  I donated it to a charity, because it is pretty and well-made.",28,1
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Loved it a little shorted than I expected but get lots of compliments,13,2
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,Actually a very cute wig too small for my head,10,3
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,My mom loved the quality and fitting of her wig.,10,4
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Wonderful wig. Fit very comfortable. The style is well kept. When you get get it and shake it. I have to rinse it in water to rinse off some residual product that's on it. But fine after that and the style holds. Brushing the wig makes it look even more satisfying. These wigs""exact"" same product are sold at a large online store for double the price. Buy it here. You'll love it",72,5
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,Nothing like the picture. Too much hair on top. Looks silly. And color was a red tint.,17,6
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,Didn't look this good.  Not nearly as full.  Returned,9,7
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,"Way too dark for my complexion. It is light brown, not blonde at all. I guess it's the lighting in the studio that makes it appear thus. I had to return it.",32,8
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,No stars. Looks nothing like the picture! Don't buy this! There aren't even any form of bangs and it's MORE than fluffy!!!,22,9
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,This wig has an entirely natural look.  Really flattering.,9,10
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Nice look and quality at a very reasonable price---the picture is a good representation of this product!,17,11
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"The wig I received has much more length than in this picture. It is a very well made and a beautiful color. It can be styled, but it will not look like this photo. Great service, shipment was received within a week!",42,12
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,Does not look at all like this picture in style of color.,12,13
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,I bought for my mother. It looked ridiculous on her and she hated it. It was way too puffy. It would be nice if there was a size chart. I'm not sure if I can even return  it.,38,14
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"Actually, for the price, it was a surprisingly nice wig.  Just not a style I could wear. Very different than what was pictured!",23,15
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Bought this for my husband to be Princess Diana, it worked well. Pretty high quality, with a little adjustment would work as a trump wig too.",26,16
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,Be aware you need to style it. It doesn't look like that when it comes,15,17
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Bought this for my 97 year old mother. She's in rehab and she needed to replace her previous one. Didn't want to spend too much fight unseen. I am amazed at the quality of thus wig. It looks just like her real hair!! It is thick bug feels soft to the touch.  Easy to style big combing. Looks just like real hair. This was supposed to be until we could take her hit s new one, now we'll keep this one permanently. Looks better than the expensive ones we've bought.",90,18
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"I ordered this for a Halloween costume, it wasn't as curly as I needed so ordered a different one.  This one is very well made though.  Good fit.  Some are very small, this one would work for medium/average sized heads.  It's a great and believable color.  Feels good on.  Not quite as layered in person but a nice wig.",59,19
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"very thick. I'm still trying to reduce the 70's volume. But wear it often --just not for ""dress-up""",18,20
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Great wig. Very cute on and was ready to wear - no shaping needed. Color was close to my own medium blond.,22,21
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,The color is a little light but the short cut is super cute. Just right for putting on after swimming.,20,22
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,It came brown not blonde like it stated and doesn't even resemble the picture!!! I hate it!!!! I wanted blonde!!!,20,23
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,The wig looked nothing like the picture and you could see the scalp part where the hair is weaved into.  It just looked cheaply made.,25,24
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,It is a real crummy made wig. I tossed it in trash.,12,25
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,It doesn't look anything like the picture. Looks too cheap,10,26
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,"This wig was horrible. It was actually missing some ""hair"" in places. Thanks for doing a cancer patient wrong.",19,27
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,For the money great wig.  Just needed trimmed up a little and color is perfect.  The company is also great for customer service.  Recommend.,24,28
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Don't hesitate.  This is a beautiful wig.  So many local shops had inferior products. So glad I took a chance on Amazon.,22,29
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,I would not recommend this product for those looking for a 'color correction' pallet like I was. I found better products at Sephora.,23,0
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,I was not impressed with this. The makeup is impossible to use and the brush broke when I took it out of the package.,24,1
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I have not really tried working with it much yet but will get around to it.,16,2
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Smaller than I expected but still a good size.  Sponge is adorably cute. And brush is very soft.  Some colors aren't very pigmented but others are.,26,3
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Honestly. If you cant spread this you aint applying it correctly. This is the second time getting this pallet. The colors are great and go one well IF you put it on the RIGHT way. Ive had my first pallet since nov. - january. So it has a good life span. Also the brush is amazing. Still learning the blending sponge since not 2 days having it my ex friend stole it. But other then that im givinf this product 5 stars. If no one knows how to contour id suggest a few youtube videos on how to contour and such!,101,4
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,A lot smaller than I thought it would be  and it's very shiny on the skin I could have gotten better quality for the same price at Walmart so I'm pretty disappointed,32,5
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,My daughter loves this makeup kit.  Only complaint is it'snot very sterdy packaging and not very much makeup.,18,6
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This is very cheap makeup. This is the kind of quality you'd see from a dollar store or in a children's play makeup kit. I tried to use it and it caked up all over my face.,37,7
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,The brush is the nicest thing out of this set. The blender sponge is uber small and the colors are very hard to use. They don't apply easily and blending is difficult.,32,8
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,"The pallete is extremely pigmented which I liked. However, the brush and the sponge that was supposed to come with it never came! All in all I was kind of disappointed.",31,9
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,didn't blend at all and the sponge didn't even come with it just saying,14,10
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Doing what name brands are for a lot more reason cost! Thank you! This is allowing my budding make-up artist learn the tricks if the trade for a lot less!,30,11
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i just thought it would be bigger and come with instructions... but the product is great and it was fast shipping,21,12
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I am so happy this was actually supposed to come on January 5-10 so it came early I love the brush and the sponge plus I rubbed my finger in the color and it came off very pigmented and I'm so excited to use so thank you so much!!!,49,13
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,The brush that comes with it is a little weird but I love it,14,14

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"It comes with a good brush and normal sponge, the box material is of cheap quality but overall the price matches with the products..",24,19
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This should be offered at a dollar store. Oily and very bad quality makeup. Dont waste your money.,18,20
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,To me this feels more like Halloween makeup than every day makeup. It's a constancy issue for me.,18,21
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,All of the inserts were melted and fell out with no brush,12,22
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"Though the brushes were good, the makeup was cheap, heavy, cakey, thick and terrible.",14,23
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"This kit is very small. Everything is way smaller that you may think, but the makeup itself is good quality. The beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless, i threw it away, its almost like a novelty toy. The brush is great and so is the makeup, but its creme. That means you have to put a few drops of water on the color you're using and water on the brush before using. I really like the palette colors. I would recommend for the price.",87,24
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"I like the tacky-ness of the product. It really makes powdered colors stick, and look vibrant.

The brush and sponge did not come with the makeup I received. :(

Amazon refunded the money for this item back to me and said it was ok that I kept the product since I didn't receive all the pieces. This made the experience super positive for me! I ended up spending more money on Amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one!",86,25
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This is like childrens fake makeup. The brush has bristles just falling out of it, I could have got better quality makeup at the dollar store.",26,26

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I love this product. I have watched a bunch of videos on YouTube on how to contour and figured I would give it a try. I ordered this kit and couldn't wait to try it. After a few attempts I think I have got it down! I would totally recommend this to my friends and relatives. I have enclosed a photo of before and after :) This is a definite product if you want to try to contour.,78,35

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I like this product just fine for the price. I have another set by another company and they are about the same. It's not supposed to be clown make up. I'm satisfied with it. There's something for all skin tones.,40,53
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I actually really like it...im a tomboy so i don't do makeup. When I got the pallet...i just went on youtube for how to's and I really like the look. Gave it 4 stars because it's a little thick...but good.,40,54

It was amazing how much junk came out of it.  then I moved on to the in wall duct.  My house has about 15 feet of dryer duct in the wall.  after working the brush around in the duct for about 5 minute, I removed the brush and then it immediately fell off the wire extention....  this could have been disasterous had it fallen off inside of the wall..

The cable for the brush isn't stiff enough to do anything it simply bends like a wet noodle. I don't even dare try the brush for the vent hose as it fell off in my hands. The vacuum attachement is folded up and when you try to use it the area where it bends collapses so you can't vacuum anything.

Appliances,B003P2WP8A,1.0,negative,"Very disappointed in this product. Packaging was the first issue: the tube was so badly kinked I still have not been able to get it straightened out. The second issue is that the tube does not fit my vacuum (before you comment on this, I have a variety of vacuums) and I was concerned about damaging vacuum(s) or product. I was finally able to ""force"" the product onto an older vacuum I have.  When I used it in my dryer lint catcher, I did not get anything at all. I wonder if this is the norm for most dryers; the advertisement led me to believe I would get ""tons"" of lint out. Last, the flat tube of the product did not fit under either my washer, dryer, refrigerator, or oven.

Since the plastic isn't flexible I can't un-kink the vacuum attachment, the plastic just cracks more.  I attached it to my shop vac but it couldn't suck air past the kinks.

The brushes are attached to very flimsy wire which offers very little rigidity, making it extremely difficult to feed the brush into the areas of the drier where lint gets trapped.

The Lint Eater can have extensions added to make it as long as you need. The black corigated Lint trap attatchment doesn't fit my shop vac, but the bigger issue was that it was folded so tightly in thee places to fit in the packaging that it cracked, so it had air leaks making it nearly useless.

It comes coiled in the box and the plastic is permanently creased out of the box.  After about 5 minutes of use those creases were already cracking.  The other annoyance is it just did not attach to my vacuum.  My vacuum hose and three attachments were just not sized for this thing to attach to.  It would be loose in the wide ends and not big enough to fit around the small ends of the attachments.  In the end, I don't expect the cheap plastic to hold up for more than one or two more uses, so I guess I won't have to ""make it work"" much longer.  I'd recommend just buying brushes separately.",129,60

Usually just a Shop Vac can suck and blow the lint right out, and/or For $10 bucks I bought the NYLON ELECTRICIANS FISH TAPE and tape a brush or lump of cloth and snake with that, it's SUPER FLEXIBLE!",133,66
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,5.0,positive,The brushes worked great.  The vacuum cleaner attachment that is supposed to be universal did not fit either of my vacuum cleaners that are very standard.  the extra long handle for the pipe brush was what made this purchase 5 stars.,41,67

Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,Happy with the 2 brushes but disappointed with the vacuum attachment. It was bent and would not straighten out nicely for cleaning. It also would not fit my vacuum hose nozzle. If I want to use it I need to duct tape it. I would not buy again.,48,69

Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,"Definitely worth the price, compared to a service call, to clean out the clogged dryer vent duct to the outdoors. We did have to work from both ends of the duct to remove the lint clog. Cons: These tools were so compressed and folded up to fit into a very small box from the manufacturer that it was hard to ""un-spring"" them to use as tools. It would have been helpful to know that one must turn the extension brush only clockwise in the duct, or the brush will un-screw from its cable stem, probably in the middle of the duct length somewhere. In the end, these tools did the job.",111,76
Appliances,B003P2WP8A,4.0,positive,"As in the picture, there is a snake-like wire which is the primary tool.  You can reach a fair bit into the dryer to a particular point.  It works pretty well, but won't clean out the dryer to an as-new quality.",41,77

Appliances,B003P2WP8A,2.0,negative,You get what you pay for. The vacuum attachment comes folded in four - which leads to creases and prevents suction and weakens the plastic. The piece broke on the very first use at multiple folds and along the sides. The brushes are brushes.,44,80

Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,"Giving this drawer a 4 because it fit perfectly in my FFHS2612LS4 Frigidaire refrigerator. Shipping was also quick and had no damage. Only issue is that you have to purchase the humidity control lever separately (Frigidaire 240362201 Slide Refrigerator https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M0YLP1C?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf ) and there are no instructions on how to attach it to the drawer, which made things unnecessary frustrating. Once I figured out how to do it though, it was very easy. Just insert the handle portion of the lever through the back of the left side hole on the drawer, give it a little twist until it sits in the hole correctly, and then you should be able to snap the right side clips into the right side slider hole.",121,11

Appliances,B00QZPGZ3A,4.0,positive,"Some people have given this product a low rating because it doesn't come with the slider bar.  But, this is not the fault of the product nor seller.  That piece is sold separately, which could perhaps be made more clear, but that is a standard practice.  If you look up the parts to your refrigerator, you will see that each and every piece is sold separately.  If you want the slider, you have to order that and connect it yourself.  This product is exactly like the one I am replacing, so I gave it a high rating.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is made of plastic and cracks fairly easily, hence the reason I had to replace it.",125,13

There was a sticker on the package that said $2.79, so I'm not sure why they cost a dollar more than that.

After arriving 3 days after they were supposed to, I was not happy to see how small the amount of buttons was, and how many of those few came already cracked and broken. What bothered me the most is that I paid over $6 for each package then saw that it has ""$2.29"" printed on the label. You're better off getting a better deal at the dollar store.",93,6

Below are the pros and cons.
Pros:
Compact and clever folding box
Lots of colors to choose from
Plenty of needles and other accessories
Cons:
Kind of cheap quality (ie: the mini scissors barely work.. the rest isn't bad)
The compact cute box I spoke of came slightly broken( One of the hinges was broken.. BUT that could be due to USPS being careless and throwing things around!) The box still folds fine, just when its open kind of goes off line.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,2.0,negative,"The Smartec Compact Foldaway Sewing Box Kit is a cute little kit that contains the essentials to do minor repairs like sew a button back on or replace a snap, but the sewing scissors that came with it are more a child's size than useful,  the small spools of thread that came with it break easily, the plastic case seems brittle, and would probably break if bumped or dropped, and the sliding plastic closures are difficult to close once you've opened it.

I could not call this a serious sewing kit. The size and brittle nature of the its plastic construction would make it a poor choice as a travel kit, and I would be very leery of giving this to any child due to the number of small easily swallowed accessories it contains.

It finally broke down due to old  age and much use, so when I saw this one, I was excited to be able to replace it.  This is not the same; it just looks the same.  It is a scaled down child size version of the real thing.  The outside slot in this one will barely hold a slim note pad.  In the original, the outside slot was big enough to hold 1 or 2 full sized sewing patterns.  The spools of thread in this one are teensy toy spools, just enough thread on each one to sew on a couple of buttons.  The original held full  sized spools of sewing thread.  If you want a stocking stuffer for a child, fine, but anyone who has any sewing acumen will scoff at this ridiculous gimcrack being called a sewing kit.",155,20

I love how it folds up for easy storing (however when you go to close it and lock it by sliding the little tabs, be gentle I accidentally slid mine right off and had to fight with it to pop the tab back on.) I adore all the cute little compartments for organizing. Perfect for every once in a while sewing. I would not recommend getting this if you are a high end sewing person or like to sew a lot.

There are various colors to use and the thread is strong and the needles are all durable and different sized.

I have gone to it numerous time for some small item and it hasn't failed me yet.
That said, I should point out that the case is not very well made. It is fine to sit on the shelf and use at home, but don't travel with it as I expect it would fall apart.

I just used it and one of the sides just fell off. I was able to fit it back on but I expect the hard plastic lever pins will break off and then I'll have to throw the whole thing away.

2. Be prepared to pull your hair out trying to do the flower kinds that are shaped like petals.
3. Vague directions. (But full picture tutorials are available on her website for 2 of the flowers)

That being said, this is great tape! Bonds to itself well and seems to be extremely tough. It has a rough, cloth-like surface as opposed to a more traditional duck tape ""plasticy-ness,"" and it's rather thick.

It glows a bright, strong green, and does so for a long time! It won't shine super bright for very long (if you hold it up to a light), but it does have a low glow that lasts for an hour or more, which is totally perceptible in the dark.

Would highly recommend! They also sell a regular sized version, if that's what you need!",123,58

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,These hooks are ok...... the smaller one that was the 2.0mm hook broke during a project.  I guess that's to be expected due to the plastic.  I like these colorful hooks but i know now to stick with stainless steel for tiny projects.,43,20

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,2.0,negative,"I had high hopes for these but was rather disappointed. The second smallest size snapped shortly into a project with very little tension.
The tops and underside of the heads have sharp and rough points- I easily sanded these off with a metal nail file but they were unusable prior to this. Lighter than an aluminum hook but much heavier than bamboo. I wouldn't purchase again",66,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,"Shipped super quick but item does NOT look like picture.  There are 5 different colored hooks in the package but they are not ""marbled"" or ""tye-dyed"" like the photo. And yeah, as someone else said, the smaller hooks are a little flimsy.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,Nice and durable. Feels weird to use since I am used to using a metal hook. Plastic feels like it catches on some fluffy yarns.,25,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,I absolutely love these hooks the only con is I wish that it had the alphabetical size on the hook it only has the numerical size.,26,40

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,"Firstly, the description is incorrect and the seller is aware but never bothered updating it, claiming that someone else had changed the description without their approval (how hard cud it be to change the description back to being correct if it were that easy to change t without approval?!)  Secondly, while the seller as polite they did not address my issues which is the description is incorrect. There's no case and no free stylus. Thirdly, when I pointed out that my issue wasn't addressed they stopped respinding to me. As lastly, the smallest hook broke.  Reported this product to Amazon got most of my $ back (less taxes) and bought a metal set instead. Better to get that metal set. The yarn glides. With these plastic ones there's a lot of friction.",132,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,I like this product because it have all different size of the crochet hooks.  All my crochet items look amazing.,20,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,I love the hooks the only problem I have with them I can not see the sizes on them even with my glasses on other than that I love them.,30,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,"These were unexpected.  I don't know exactly what I expected, but they were very bright and colorful.  These are also for Christmas",22,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,"I ordered this set just for the big hooks and they are just great. They are smooth, easy to work with and don`t catch the yarn.  The smaller ones are not so smooth, (3.00 mm and 4.00 mm), but anyway if you are planning more precise crochet project it`s better to order metal hooks.",54,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,Arrived timely and good value but several of the hooks are unusable.  The grooves were fused together so the yarn just keeps slipping. The larger hooks are better but needed to filed down as there were pieces of acrylic still stuck on them. I would buy these again for sure and just spend the money on higher quality ones.,59,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,"I bought these more for the larger hooks in the set and could honestly care less about the small ones, which look about as sturdy as those plastic sword toothpicks, but another reviewer said they hold up well. They do have some rough edges, mostly out of yarn's way on the end, but annoying enough to want to sand off. There was no ""plastic wallet/case"" to speak of either, just the hooks.

I must have gotten lucky because shipping was actually pretty quick.

Overall I got what I paid for and expected nothing more.",94,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,5.0,positive,"Only issue is its difficult to see the sizes, but that is the acrylic aspect of them. overall the product was good, took some time to get it from China, but I am pleased with the product and would buy again if needed.",43,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,4.0,positive,Like the sizes  feel a little flimsy but so far so good. If I find a flaw I'll let people know,21,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,great!! they were coming off a but in the cornerns but not a big deal.  they served its purpose for my scarecrow pants.,23,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,easy to work with these go on fast and easy. The colors are great these came fast and I will reorder again.,22,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,Followed directions. Went on just fine. After first wash they pulled away from the edges and were almost completely off. Waste of money IMO. Had to actually see them on and even then they don't stick to my jeans.,39,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,Seller was good and this item arrived promptly.  BUT... This produce is horrible.  Selected these and paid more money because I thought they were nicer looking.  Followed instructions and all the patches did not stick to the jeans or they stuck and then immediately fell off (before wearing jeans).  Would return them for a refund if I could but I have used them.  Feeling totally ripped off. they do not work and nobody else should waste their money on these.,80,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,I got great use out of these. Work like they should and easy to put on.,16,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,didn't last through more then 2-3 washes  =(,8,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,Does the job and very easy to apply. No complaints except material is kind of cheap,16,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,They work just make sure you do it right because I got another hole in my jeans at the edge of the patch because I didn't make it overlap enough.,30,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,"The good: You can cut these to the size you'd like.

The bad: They would not adhere at all. I tried every single patch that came in this packet, and not one would stick to the fabric. It would stick partially, if at all, and then after cooling would peel right off. I'm a seasoned pro at ironing on patches, and so I feel confident saying that these are simply poor quality. $11 for a handful of patches is bad enough, but $11 for patches that won't even stick is just insulting. I feel like I've been ripped off, frankly, and I don't usually feel that way after purchasing something off Amazon.

I ordered some iron-on patches from another company off Amazon, and those adhered beautifully. These are a scam.",130,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,This item did not stick as per instructions I had to sew,12,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,Saved my favorite sweat pants.  The patches are great for large holes..... easy to cut for smaller ones (one can cut any design in the patch). Holds great during washing and drying without tacking the patch. Just wished there was more than one sheet of each patch.,47,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,"Unfortunately these patches did not work very well for me at all. Applied one onto a pair of jeans which came off within 5 minutes. I had also followed the instructions exactly as stated. I would NOT recommend these, even though they are very pretty. If you want to sew them on then buy them; but if you're looking for a quick fix, these patches aren't your answer!",68,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,One of the patterns was an exact match for my favorite robe and I was able to match the plaid so well it is undetectable. Very easy to apply.,29,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,4.0,positive,"I love these, they are really cute, they were easy to apply but after two washes in the washing machine, one of the patches came off. The other's are still going strong but I was a little disappointed that one came right off.",43,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,Maybe you are supposed sew them on too but they came off after one wash.,15,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,Fell off the jeans I ironed them onto within minutes. Disappointing.,11,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,"Cute fabric, but did not stick to surface and lifted almost instantly. Bummed.",13,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,"The look great but did not adhere to my [clean, dry] pants - total bummer.",15,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,2.0,negative,"These are cute patterns/plaids, but the material is thin and the adhesive is weak. I used them for my son's jeans, and when I washed them all the patches came off. You could reinforce with stitching, but the material itself might not hold that either.",45,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,Will go nice on plain material shirts in the boys closet.,11,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,5.0,positive,"These work well, adds a stylish touch to an old pair of jeans.",13,20

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,"Horrible! You do not get a variety of colors, it is nothing like what is pictured. I only received four different colors, dark blue, light blue, red, pink, oh and one yellow button.",33,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,5.0,positive,"The buttons look beautiful and exactly like the ones in the picture. I did expect a little more, but I didn't count how many buttons there were so I'm not sure. Although, you can't really expect much for $3-4. Overall, seems like a great product.",45,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,1.0,negative,I thought buying this was a good deal until they arrived. Over 10 were broken when they arrived in the envelope package. Not happy about that at all,28,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,4.0,positive,"The buttons are vibrant colors and are perfect for making button necklaces, when paired with some painted buttons also sold on Amazon.  The price is very reasonable. The only complaint is you don't get over 50, but I wouldn't want them to decrease the size of the buttons to meet the quantity advertised(to satisfy the 40g weight indicated), so I can accept this issue. The colors are more vibrant than the picture shows. I've ordered more.",76,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,"As most other reviews have said, these aren't coaster sized. Im not sure I even had a piece that was 4 in diameter. More than 2/3 of my bag was the size of a silver dollar. Not what I needed at all. I had no choice but to cherry pick the largest ones to use for my ornaments.

There is a dedicated low beam set and a driving/high beam set.  I got the low beam switched out pretty easy with 9006 8000K single beam HID system.  I looked up the type of bulb for the driving/ high beam set and it was 9005. So I ordered a 9005 HID SYSTEM thinking it would be an easy swap like the low beams. Nope..... after installing that system...  they flickered... And didn't get bright for the high beams.  After further investigation I discovered that Toyota is using a voltage change to achieve the difference in brightness. Obviously this will not work for HID. So then I decided to find a ""white"" as possible halogen bulb. Well... when I got these bulbs I was under the impression that they would be whiter and or brighter than stock. Don't let the blue color of the bulbs fool you.  They not only don't shine blue, they don't even act like they are closer to cool white than stock.  Now.... they are brighter.... but not whiter.

They may look ""white"" if you are staring directly at the blazing bulb; but the light cast on the road is distintively a halogen yellow.  If you have an HID low-beam but do not want a yellow high-beam, then this is a good light.  Used on a 2001 X4 with factory 4300k HID.  The bulb has a royal blue bulb that ""changes"" the yellow to a white light (about 5000k); just barely a hint of blue compared to the factory HID.  Any halogen that attempts to change the color towards HID will compromise brightness.  This was acceptable to me since I rarely use my high-beam to flash other drivers.",126,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,"Bought this for my central AC unit outside that had a lot of mashed spots. There were no instructions on how to use this or put it together so I had to youtube it, it looked 'easy' the way the guy just combed through the fins but when you actually go to do this, unless your fins are only slightly askew, you're going to get stuck.

I ended up just sitting there using the comb for over an hour on the spots and eventually noticed that the individual combs started to break or get bent. It's plastic, and not very sturdy plastic at that. After losing 3 prongs I just ended up getting a small thin blade and using the flat side to coax the dents out. Worked better than this fin straightener.

Pros:
-Well...it works for a bit.

Cons
-cheap plastic

Bottom line: If the fins you're trying to fix are only slightly out of shape, then this would be easy to use. But if you got some big dents and a lot of them, you should look for one that has metal prongs. (Or just get thin sturdy blade and spend a bit more time and patience).",199,0

One thing.  The band to hold the back to the seat is just barely big enough to go around my seat.  I don't have anything to hook the loops on the bottom part to, but that's not a problem for me.  I think I would work well enough just sitting unsecured in the seat.

Refill, install adapter,..pump to 5 psi,..adjust as required to hold pressure..Bleed brake furtherest from MC..(rear pass side ?).. use care not to completely drain MC....break seal, refill MC and repeat...took 30 mins to do all 4 wheels taking my time.didn't spill a drop...When I did this job 1 year ago,..I put brake fluid in the bleeder and it leaked at the MC despite passing an initial pressure leak check. I also have a 2005 Miata for which I have the correct MC adapter ( threaded)....even so I prefer to just use the bleeder as a pressure source and continually add brake fluid to the MC as I work my way around the vehicle...added benefit, no clean up of bleeder required...
Update: 2-2-2018: Built this rig and now use it with the power bleeder,..see pic,..this works way better,..holds pressure no leaks..Again,..just using as a pressure source, 5-10 psig....I depressurize and refill for each wheel,..quick and efficient...Keep level above low level in your MC...",203,0

I guess I just couldn't believe the manufacturer who sells an otherwise excellent product would include something that wouldn't work.

With that out the way I went to my local HF store, picked up 2 inexpensive clamps and man--I was amazed at how well it turned out!  It even seals better than my 1107 (requires little fine tune turns to seal) does!

Worked great on 2010 Honda Fit. Did NOT work at all on 2012 Camry due to the cap-side of the master cylinder slanting upward, meaning the chain would slide right off during tightening. This is not the adapters fault, I'm not sure I could get ANY adapter to work on that darn thing. Instead I used a pneumatic air bleeder, which works but it's WAAAAY slower, but, again, it works....

Automotive,B000Q6UHQ0,2.0,negative,"It's not very easy to use on my '07 G35.  Since it is a universal cap, it doesn't seal 100%; the metal chain that goes around the brake and clutch fluid reservoir to create the seal works but the reservoirs aren't perfectly flat on the bottom to prevent the chain from moving.  Therefore, the chain can move loosening the tension and breaking the seal.  I would recommend to either pump the brake and clutch pedals the old fashion way to get an actual cap for the vehicle you're working on to make sure there's an appropriate seal.  Brake fluid is very abrasive and having it spill all over the paint is not good, which is what happened to me :(",120,31

I purchased this along with the ""Motive Products Power Bleeder - European- Black Label"" which I returned (see other review). I could not find a ""Black Label"", i.e. metal instead of plastic, for the universal adapter. Problem is the cap is not rigid enough to hold pressure. First time I use it, leak all over the floor. Since I could not found any metal universal adapter, I used a rectangle piece of 1/2 inch thick PlexiGlass and drilled 3 holes for the center hose and the two J-screws.  Materials and labor from Tap Plastic cost around $8. Slide the PlexiGlass on top of the cap and tight the J-screw, worked the first time.

Not to mention the fact that with this cup holder on, you can literally forget about using the emergency brake again. You won't be able to reach it (if a bottle or a coffee cup are sitting in it) and the brake will not pull all the way!

Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,"This is an excellent product.  It's easy to install, took only minutes to install, still allows me to use my emergency brake, and looks like it came from the factory.  It holds a 12 oz can or a small drink from McDonalds perfectly.  And that's the problem.

A 20 oz drink bottle, most medium drinks, my Eco Canteen, and EVERY large drink will simply not fit.  You know those plastic cups they have at 711, Quick Trip and Arby's that get smaller at the bottom to help them fit into older cupholders?  Well, they fit this .... almost.  You can shove it down a bit and it will stand up when you're sitting still, but if you don't keep a hand on it, it will definitely fall over under even mild acceleration or cornering.

Still, this is better than no cupholder at all.  Some time ago, I saw a cupholder that fit into these small ones that held bigger drinks.  I found the Kaz e Kup ([...]), which is sort of like what I remember seeing.  If I can't find anything better, I will definitely order that.

If your parking brake takes more then ""3 clicks"" to hold the back brakes you will be lifting up the holder.

I even got a great deal though the Amazon Warehouse deals.  It said it was used, but the only thing I saw that was slightly off was the box (wrinkled and shelf worn)!  The Weathertech product was in new condition and it installed with no problem whatsoever.

Functionally you can drive with your windows down to the level of the deflector or slightly lower and not get that huge rush of wind and attendant noise that comes with it.  You can also leave your windows cracked open so the heat escapes when it is parked and to everyone else from the outside it looks like the windows are up (dark tint).",128,7
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,"The front deflectors fit well but they tend to rattle when the wind hits them just right. The rear deflectors are terrible since they do not prevent water from entering in a 2010 Honda CR-V. The problem is the Honda rear window design is not suited for rain deflectors. I left the rear window deflectors in however since Weather Tech would not offer my installer a partial refund. Note that the metal clips that are used on the rear deflectors have permanently damaged the rubber trim on the windows. Be careful how you install them so you don't bend the rubber window trim.

Eventually the rear deflectors kept coming loose and kept falling off so I eventually removed them. Bottom line: I recommend that you don't buy the rear deflectors on a Honda CR-V.

(I have tried vent-mounts previously with relative success, but found turning corners to be an issue when the vent-mount would swing away from view.)

The concept of the CommuteMate NavCup is a good one; the execution of the concept, however, is poor.

First, the cradle will accomodate only the thinnest of gps units, which rules out the use of my Navigon GPS.

Second, in spite of power cord ""cut outs"" in the cradle for routing the cord, they will not accomodate a standard length micro USB jack in the bottom of one of my gps units... to say nothing of the offset micro USB jack on a secondary GPS unit I own.

The cost of return shipping does not make it cost effective to return, so perhaps my review will spare another from making an unnecessary purchase.

The essential problem with the item comes down to the fact it is not adjustable.  It convienently fit our Tomtom and sat sturdily on our dashboard (A RAV4).  It was when we pulled out of our driveway that we realized it sat too far back and you could hardly see it with the glare.  Our particular model of RAV has the dashboard swoop up in the center where you would put such an item.  This made it unreadable.

I live in a mountainous area with lots of inclines and downgrades and turns. In all the time I've been using the NavCup, my Motorola Droid has never slipped out in any direction. The GPS, which is quite a bit larger than the Droid also has never slipped out regardless of speed or direction of travel. Everything stays in place as if it were glued on!

Bear in mind that this is during the height of winter and everything in the car is cold. I wonder what it will be like during summer?

Highly recommended (for now).

UPDATE (05/17/2012): Lo these many years and this thing continues operating very well. The heat didn't faze it one bit. The rubber mat is accumulating dust rather quickly now and so requires a good clean from time to time, otherwise spot on. Upgrading to a five-star review, it deserves it.",176,22

Unfortunately, the door skins were too small to fit on my 1999 upper door frames even though I followed the instructions and left them to bake and stretch for several hours in the Florida summer heat and sun. Despite multiple attempts, I wasn't able to get more than one of the four corners to fit on the frame at the same time. I finally gave up and took advantage of Amazon's excellent return policy and returned these. I subsequently purchased the Smittybilt door skins and they fit easily on the upper door frames.",104,6

Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,Ok so here is my say on these! It is a great looking product! But I feel it can be manufactured way better to not rip in certain areas. Hands down quick but painfull assembly. Buy them pre fabricated on the frames and save yourself the anger and hassle,49,11

So Nope, it wasn't us, heat or any other BS I see some people have been given to ""why this happened to them"" Its just a bad product.  Since we have has Jeeps for almost 40 years we thought we would just buy the ""skins"" this time cause we wanted to save $$$ and already have several sets of frames because we normally buy them with the frames....... NOPE, they do NOT go on. Heat only helps somewhat, but cant work miracles and both of mine are worth nothing, AKA trashed!! Now with that said....

Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,Like others that have posted I had one heck of a time getting this to go on the  metal frame. I actually pulled the skin off the end of three of my fingers. After about an hour of heating with the oven and a blow dryer I gave up and went to plan B. I got the three corners on - bottom two corners and the rear corner on the top - and then lubricated the metal frame (at the front/top) with Wesson Oil. I then used two adjustable wrenches to pry and lift the final corner over the metal frame. I used small adjustable wrenches and used the bottom of the wrench where its flat and round and smooth so there was no concern about poking a hole in the fabric. I put one wrench bottom over the top of the frame and the other over the side of the frame. Inserted them into the fabric and slowly lifted and pulled the corner fabric over the frame. It went on the first try. Not sure if it's because I had heated and stretched it already or not but it worked. I'm going to wait until next weekend to do the other side.,203,16

Automotive,B002HSD19A,2.0,negative,"I bought these to replace a set of Smittybilt windows that was a bit faded and had been cut (broken in to) on one side.  It surprised me that the Smittybilt windows were a higher quality product than the Rampage.

Pros:
- The fit is pretty good, and installation wasn't TOO hard.
- zippers do not jingle like the Smittybilt, due to the zipper pulls being cord and not metal

Cons:
- The windows are wavy at the top, which distorts your view out the sides.  I don't see any reason that they have to be wavy.
- One zipper has broken on each window in only 3 months.  Luckily there are two zippers so I can still close and open the window.

Automotive,B002HSD19A,4.0,positive,"First, I must say that the phone support folks at Rampage are great - patient with all of my questions, always inviting me to call back if I had any more issues.
When you first unpack these skins and hold them up to the frames, you'll say ""no way"".  I almost gave up and sent them back a couple of times.  Finally I heated them with a hair dryer as I was stretching them over the frames, and they finally slipped into place.  Note - get a partner to hold the hair dryer while your stretch - it's much easier.
The gentleman at Rampage explained why they are so tight.  It seems Jeep made two sizes of door frames those years (97-99 I think) so the skins were made so they could fit the larger frame yet not be too large for the smaller frame.  Not sure if that's the case, but it sounds logical to me.
Otherwise, great quality and service.",162,25
Automotive,B0046LOE06,4.0,positive,"I bought this for indoor use with occasional exposure to mild weather. The 14'2"" size fits 09 Solstice Coupe fairly well, wraps down to cover about 75% of the wheels even. Elastic band makes it tricky to put on a slippery waxed car for one person. Keeps dust out nicely, and some oil that dripped on it from my garage door hardware didn't penetrate. Interesting texture ...feels finely woven, with a light plastic/teflon film coating. Light, strong, but not quite what I'd call soft or velvety. No experience with rain or wind yet, but based on the non-custom fit, I suspect it could mar the finish if the non-snug portions flap around excessively over time.",115,0

The cover is large enough and is fairly easy to put on. I will say that it's better if 2 people handled the cover when attempting to cover the car. Taking it off is no problem but the cover is a bit bulky and does not fold into a neat little shape very easily.  I'd say it's a mid grade quality cover.

The other required the adhesive (which I didn't want to use). The sound from my MP3 was great and I was impressed. However, the communication between the two units is horrible. You have to max out the volume and you get an echo effect; if you can hear the other person at all.

Both of the units have a problem getting the plug from the microphone/speakers to stay properly plugged into the main unit. If they are not plugged in all of the way, the sound does not play for both ear speakers. It usually will only have sound in one unless you press and hold the plug into the main unit. In addition, the unit has a hard time staying place in the mounting device connected to the helmet. It comes out too easily.

You must constantly unplug it if you are going to set your helmet down so you do not cause any damage to the connection, but no matter what, it is very sensitive. Therefore, you will constantly struggle to get a good connection between the helmet speakers and the unit.

The clarity between helmet to helmet is not very good, and after a few yards, you start loosing connection. Once that happens, the units will not automatically reconnect and you will have to pull over to synchronize them again.

I will recommend this product over the Chatterbox, which I also returned.

Look into the Sena SMH10, which is well reviewed compared to other helmet bluetooth products. I hope this helps!",161,30
Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,The product is small and very basic. It does the job for a quick ride or quick dayley commuit. The speaker are modertly loud as long as your bike doesn't have load pips meaning after market pipes. It does come with a fm radio mode and works with some stations meaning like 10 so you kinda learn to like new station or you can just make a play list through your phone and use that but the Prouduct is what it is cheap n you get what u pay for a simple but affective Device for someone not looking into paying so much money.,104,31

Exchanged and everything looked ok but once we got on the road realized one of them never held a charge no matter how long I charged it. Now on our trip we could not talk to each other. Used the working one for Bluetooth to my iPhone, which worked great. However, if I tried to use the fm radio function, it could never pick up a station, even in a big city like Washington, D.C.  When we got back I tried to return via amazon and they denied because it was beyond their return period. I sent several messages to seller and manufacturer and no one will respond to me. $220 wasted. Super disappointment. Don't waste your time or money.",133,36

When a call was placed I was told several times that they could not make out what I was saying, even with the microphone right in front of my mouth on a full face helmet. Also was stationary with the bike not running. I don't recommend this product to anyone. Spend more money and do your research. Sena or Scala are better products.",85,48
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"Pros:
-Voice control compatible
-LCD worded display
-At least its not a chatterbox!

Cons:
-It had no volume. even cruising on my bike at 60. Couldnt hear it. At all.
-Clunky and awkward.
-FM radio? you're joking. does anybody still use that? It kept inadvertently getting stuck in FM mode. Now when im stopped the last thing i want to hear is static on max volume. Terrible idea, and probably the killer for this product.

If you want a headset thats good and has rider-rider functionality and good volume and voice/siri control, go with the Sena SMH10.

Please don't waste your time on this product.",105,49

Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,The Blinc M2 is great device if only the plug for the speakers was consistent. It occasionally comes out to the point where you spend the majority of your ride trying to push the plug in properly to listen to your music. This defeats the purpose of enjoying a ride. The FM modular is worthless because it rarely gets a good signal and all you hear is rushing noise. The speakers do sound good when it is working properly for the MP3. I do not recommend this product to anyone. You'll whine up disappointed as I am about this purchase.,100,51

Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"They have a proprietary charging device.  That right there should make you not purchase it.  It should come with a standard 12v charging chord and be able to charge it via usb as well.  You know, what everyone has on their motorcycles to power and charge devices.  With this, you run out, you have to stop somewhere or just wait until you get home to charge it.  Worthless in my opinion.  I should have thought about that before I purchased it.  Music and audio does sound alright though in my opinion.  I don't use it anymore though.  Looking for an alternative.

My other complaints are that it wasn't ""glove friendly"" and the volume was insufficient to be heard when riding. 0

BTW, I don't understand why the radio frequency is displayed on it when it's outside the helmet. My old Parrots (which sadly died and are no longer made) actually ""spoke"" the radio frequencies as it locked on them. I wish Parrot would introduce a replacement for the SK4000.",101,57
Automotive,B004FDY27K,4.0,positive,"Everything seems to work great on it, if you spend the time to tinker with the installation abit.

The speakers are more then loud enough for both music and voice if you make sure to get them close enough to your ear, i had to put a piece of 1/4"" double sided sticky to mine to get them to properly placed in my helmet.

I don't have any problem with it losing connection to my android phone as of yet, ive only rode about 60 miles with them so far. so hopefully they don't develop any problem there.

Cant comment on rider to rider, only one so far, but plan on getting a second if this continues to work out.

The FM Reciver is really weak and looses signal easy,  I have fixed that problem by using an old fm antenna wire from a old ati tuner i had laying around and working it around the top inside of my helmet and then wrapping the ends around each side of the earphone wires and taping them.  Now it never seems to drop.",182,58
Automotive,B004FDY27K,1.0,negative,"We installed this product on two brand new helmets with ease; however,the sound quality was poor and the intercom feature is completely useless.  We had to turn the unit off and resort to the old fashioned method of yelling at each other.  We got this primarily for the intercom feature and now will sell both units.  Also  the battery life is only fair.  We go on long rides and it doesn't last.  We didn't bother pairing with the phones as we don't like phone calls when we get to ride.  The music quality I though was poor at best and the FM feature is very weak.  A cheap set of ear buds are far better in sound quality.

If you are going more than 45 mph, you will not hear anything, or if you have any type of loud or aftermarket mufflers on your bike forget it. I would find something better.",89,67
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"I bought this device to enjoy while commuting around the Phoenix metropolitan area.
It continually loses connection with my phone.  I've tried MP3's, streaming audio, podcasts, music, a variety of media: it doesn't matter the source, this device will not maintain a constant link with my phone.  I originally thought it was my phone, I've reinstalled apps & players, and sure enough when I use headphones I have no problems, my phone plays for hours without any problems.  When I sync with the Blinc M2, it may work for 20 minutes, it may work for 2 min.  I've cleared & re-synced the Blinc M2 with my phone several times without success.

Here's the kicker, the FM Radio feature is terrible.  I'm using this device in and around Phoenix, AZ where I can literally see the transmitting tower on ""south mountain"".  This thing will have a signal for 30 seconds, then go to complete static & lose the station.  Tune it to a different channel & you may hear it clearly for 10 seconds before its overcome by static.

How can I give it one star?  I got one phone call without a problem.

Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,"I have a helmet with a version of this integrated into the helmet and love it!
my wife however did not have one and since we often ride together she had to have one too, but we already had a helmet
it took about 2 min to install and works great, all we had to modify is a spacer behind the speaker to get it closer to her for clarity
Has FM radio and Bluetooth capability, also after pairing they act as an ""intercom"" that is one button to start and stop a conversation.

I think the integrated version is a lot less bulky but they added a few more buttons on this version so its pretty user friendly and the ability to temporarily mount it with the clip means it can move to the next helmet!

After 2 weeks of use the bluetooth reciever was busted. I sent it back to amazon for a refund. Now the speakers that came with it were terrible. The mic was very good though.

Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"This is a great product, from any way you look.
1. It has FM radio function is great, the only point against is that every so often about every 25 minutes off I guess this function for saving energy security in case you forget to turn off.
2. Excellent volume, but this aspect should be very careful, for safety and to hear the other cars around us. The sound of this product is very good but a bit lacking in bass. When you plug your phone as mp3 player, it's great fun and makes you a ride, or simply the way home or work.
3. The multifunction button, does not seem very strong construction, so you must use care not to damage it. The button is very easy to use, even if you use gloves to handle your motorcycle.
4. For sure if you need to leave and locked the helmet on your motorcycle, you can remove the bluetooth.

Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,"I enjoy Robin Hobb's work, but I don't know if I can truly say I enjoyed reading Forest Mage.  It turns everything we saw in Shaman's Crossing on its head, and indeed, Shaman's Crossing becomes simply a prologue to Nevare's ongoing story.

The book itself is relentless and challenging, and I suppose that serves to give us some idea of the life Nevare finds himself facing.  At the end of Shaman's Crossing we thought Nevare had triumphed over multiple adversaries - and he had, but won those battles only to lose the war.

We meet new characters, and old friends return - almost all changed for better or worse, save Epiny, who is the strange combination of selfless and selfish she always was.

Lastly, the magic of Nevare's world is really a character all of its own in this book, in a way rarely seen in fantasy fiction.

Forest Mage is an enthralling story, but one that is truly in the mold of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - only bad things happen, and the protagonist's world is in ruins at its end.

I look forward to the final Soldier's Son volume, and hope to truly enjoy reading it.",198,0

There are flashes of her incredible skill with words as she weaves some beautiful forest imagery, but the story drags and could have been much shorter.

I was amazed at the talent displayed here, because it seems the author is treading such a fine line most of the time. There are certain times in the book when you know that if it had been written differently, it would have been offensive and/or uncomfortable to an utterly extreme level. But the artistry behind the way Robin herds your brain into thinking about something a certain way is plainly astounding. It's an intelligent book, and it requires a certain appreciation for the writing that I think might escape some, but for others it is well worth the read.",130,3

I don't know that I can be disappointed with Hobb's works. It just doesn't seem like a possibility for me. The balance of introspection and activity makes this book a true first-person wonder. The richness of the world around Nevare rivals our own world. Gernia is a real place. It's that simple. It's just a different reality from ours. Forest Mage truly feels like Hobb has traveled to that place, plucked a book from their world, and brought it back for us to enjoy. This is simply a masterpiece of storytelling, and one I am pleased to have uncovered.

Fantasy lovers, Hobb is well worth your time. I promise it.",132,5

I love Robin Hobb and I've read all of her Farseer-related works, but this series is just painful to read. Book one wasn't a masterpiece, but it had promise. It was slow, but I thought it was leading up to action in this book. Except this book is even more ponderous, more plodding, more woe-is-me, no action, 50 different ways of saying the same thing until she's filled enough space to sell it as a trilogy. I wish I could say to slog through because book 3 gets better, but honestly it doesn't (although at least the plot has action in book 3, in this one it's just pages of introspection and pity partying).

I love Robin Hobb's writing, definitely, and the Forest Mage is full of beautiful descriptive language that really makes you see the scenes, and you really understand Nevare...but the thing is, I guess I am used to fantasy where the hero accepts the strange magic dumped into his life sooner.  Seriously - you don't spend 2 whole books with Frodo refusing to believe the Ring is magical, or Rand al'Thor wandering in the forest refusing to believe any of this has anything to do with him.

If you want a quick review of this book it goes like this: He (Nevare) gets fat, people laugh; he gets fatter, people start to hate him; he gets fatter, everyone hates him; he gets obscenely fat and realizes its due to ""speck magic"". Yes, being able to use magic turns you into an obese creature whom I can only assume resembles Jaba the Hutt from Star Wars. Yet I still read it because Hobb writes so well it lulls you in.

Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,"I am a huge Robin Hobb fan, especially after reading the Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogies.  I also really liked Shaman's Crossing - the first book in the Soldier Son trilogy but after reading Forest Mage, I am afraid to read any more of Robin's books.  Forest Mage was a brutal and awful book with very few redeeming qualities.  There is so much more that could have been done with Nevare's character.  Instead, I found him obsequious, disgusting and cowardly.  And that opinion has not a thing to do with the fact that in this book Nevare is battling magic-induced obesity.  It has more to do with his depravity.  He was an amazing character in Shaman's Crossing but now I actually despise him and don't want to read another word about him.  I kept hoping as I read on and on, skimming some of the worst passages, that things would improve, that Nevare would do something to make me like him again but it never happened.  If I hadn't been on an eight hour Transatlantic flight with just this book, I would've stopped reading it which is something I rarely do.  Robin Hobb - what were you thinking?",198,24
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,"Once again I read reviews bemoaning lack of ""action"" and ""emo"". If you've read the first book you know by now that there aren't any epic battles with swords or guns. You also know that you are journeying with a man through all of his thoughts and fears. What is different in this book is the emotional intensity of Navarre's experiences. Relationships are destroyed, I mean not just killed but ground into the dust, revived, and then beaten back down for good measure. Navarre is often helpless, frustratingly so and I yelled at him quite a bit though a lot of the time I'm not sure I would have made a better decision. The problem is none of the choices are great choices. There is nothing that will make everything right. That's true enough in the real world, but in this one there is powerful magic to distort and magnify everything. Little is left for human dignity.

Well this book kind of took me through the emotional wringer in a lot of ways and it is hard to believe there is another one. I read it pretty much non-stop.",189,25
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,"I've liked Hobb's other series but had not read the Soldier Son trilogy.  I read the first, ""Shaman's Crossing"" and thought it wasn't quite on the same high level but (OK), I'll reserve judgment.  I've just read ""Forest Mage"" and will not read the final title.  ""Forest Mage"" shows the hero at the beginning as in a bad way, removed from the past prospects that he originally had.  He is essentially down and out.  The novel then proceeds to show him failing at every single test.  At the end, he is a despised fugitive from society, his family, the law.  All of this is unmerited and he is entirely passive.

If anyone enjoys reading a fantasy of complete destruction of the main character, then this is the novel for you.  Making it even more amazing, he is touched with magic but never comes to the smallest understanding whatsoever about himself or the nature of the magic.

Nicely written, as always.  If the reader isn't depressed at the outset, then his/her depression is guaranteed by the end of this sodden fantasy.  No stars, a failure.",184,26

Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,"I was disappointed in this book partly because my expectations of Robin Hobb are so high. Her characterisations are excellent, her plots full and thought provoking. She writes with a passion, and makes you think about your own assumptions and actions.

But in this book, Nevare Burvelle IS Fitzchivalry Farseer. The protaganists are so similar that it quite spoiled the book. Both are procrastinators. Both are cursed with an unacceptable magic. Both are forced to break all ties with their family and end up being believed dead by the ones they love. Both share a similar morality. The list goes on. Robin Hobb has simply recreated a character that she lovingly brought to a conclusion once before.

This series could have been written by another author. The characters were too few, and too simple. One of my most favorite things about Hobb's books are that her characters are so dynamic. You can relate to them, they change over time, and there are so many. While technically this world is as creative and as original as her others, I didn't find the overall reading experience pleasurable. Most of the time I was bored or irritated with the characters and storylines.

If you are a fan of Hobb and looking to explore this series, I'd say you are better off missing out. If you are new to the author, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD start with another of her trilogies.",162,32

This is absolutely one of the worst books I have read in ages and I tell you with all sincerely to skip it and pick up something else. I couldn't stand reading through it after 3/4 of the way in and just gave up. Not going to read the final book. It is that depressing.

I do not understand the author's equating obesity with magic.  Maybe it will all come clear in the last book, but I won't read it so I won't know. It sure seems like she has some kind of obsession with weight....
This book was hugely depressing and I cannot fathom how anyone can say they enjoyed this book.  I lost interest in Nevare early on and the story just got darker and more depressing, as well as having many obscure plot moments (what was with the spinning top thing that somehow related to the Plains folk magic?  Weird.)

With that said I must say that I enjoyed this book just as much if not more then the first one.  I enjoyed the pacing and story.  My only criticism is that on the dream sequences the author is much too descriptive for my liking. Other then that I like the world she created and the characters as well.  If you are a fantasy reader that loves to love the main character then this might not be the series for you.  He is definitely the central character in the story however he is not an archetypical fantasy hero.  He's kind of an uninteresting character thrown into an interesting situation.  I find it entirely very interesting though.  I think the author is at her best with this story.  The story might not be as enticing as the Farseer Series but her writing is topnotch.,171,37

I never cared about the main character and by the first quarter of the second book I hated him.  The characters seem to follow a script rather than a pattern of normal behavior and this becomes blindingly obvious when he gets fat and EVERYONE rejects him to the point that they want to kill him. Conflict is driven by a malicious unseen force that no one has any hope of overcoming. It's like reading about a hobo who walks along a train track knowing that he's going to get hit by a train and he keeps walking. And he's got his wife and kids with him. But I don't care about the hobos family either because I have no reason to. There is no good or bad it seems, just a constant force of nature that's going to kill everything, but it happens three books too late. I didn't finish the third book.

I started reading another book and I just couldn't get into that one. So I decided to pick up Forest Mage again and give it a shot. Well, long story short: I'm glad I did. I enjoy the depth of characterization Ms. Hobb creates (for the most part). I also enjoy the story of the day to day struggles of Nevare and his ability to overcome. Nevare is flawed, which makes him a more interesting real subject as are all the others in the book. Ms. Hobb has a gift for fleshing out the characters and the story.

I had high hopes for this book because I really enjoyed the first one in the series.  Hobb has a way of really bringing believable characters to life and Shaman's Crossing was more of the same.  However, the more I read Forest Mage, the more appalled I became.

The MINUTE Nevare began to gain weight, he was insulted and shunned by EVERYONE (except the Specks).  I think only one character at the end was nice to him.  I am hoping that the reviewer who called Nevare a fat slob was being fasecious and not as insulting as Hobb.

I wonder if Hobb is working through some issues of her own and chose to explore them in this text.

The ""fat"" stigma which Nevere faces was well chosen as this is something that hits home with readers. Our culture too despises fat...readers can face the same internal loathing as Nevere.

I'll keep slogging in Renegade just to find out how it all ends but will probably just skim it.

Unfortunately, the pain was to acute and I could not make it past page 200 when I realized that he would never loose the weight that he had been cursed with from the Speck plague.
Hobbs writes this tale of a man cursed with majic fat. This fat cannot be lost through diet or excercise. The fat changes the way people perceive him, gets him kicked out of the Academy, and disowned by his family. I would love to know all that happens but the first person telling of this poor man's distruction was to difficult.

Forest Mage, the second book in the series, follows Nevare as he travels home from the Academy to Widevale for his brother's wedding.

I imagine that people who only get a thrill from reading a constant stream of fight scenes may find this book a little slow, but those who take an interest in a character's internal development will have trouble putting it down. Though, I must add that once you adjust to the pace, there is plenty of action and suspense to enjoy, with a touch of horror for spice-- I found it quite gripping.

The sex scenes are both frequent and disgusting, with far to many details.

The suprise ending is somewhat original, even interesting, but not nearly enough to save this train wreck.

Nevare was not a character I especially liked in the first volume of this trilogy and I thought my feelings for him were not going to change.  And they didn't, not until the final few paragraphs of Forest Mage, a few paragraphs that I found such a perfect ending that it completely redemed Nevare for me.  As for the rest of the book, I didn't find it depressing at all, just totally engrossing.  I didn't do much of anything for a day and half but read this book.  I love Robin Hobb's world-building, her way of creating such marvelous cultures and mythologies.  This book was no exception.  The forest, the Specks, the walkers, I loved all of it, and would happily have continued reading for another 700 pages.  Can't wait till volume 3; this story is going to haunt me until I can finally read the ending.

Thanks Robin, for another enthralling story.",163,72
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,"I loved this sequel to Shaman's Crossing.  Ms. Hobb takes her time developing characters. Some readers find that tedious. I love the way it unfolds.  As the story unwinds, you find yourself swept along whether you really want to be or not.  Whether you feel empathy or revulsion, you are on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. Ms. Hobb's characters are flawed and sometimes you end up slapping your forehead over dumb decisions they make.  But the point is that you care about them anyway.  At least, I do.  I can feel the bouts of power and helplessness that Navarre struggles with.

The Farseer Trilogy is one of my favorite sets of reading.  I can see similarities between what Navarre and Fitz suffered.  Is it magic or fate?  Self-sacrifice or hopes for the future?

I may not always like the lead character, but I can't put the book down because I am always pulling for him.  I can't wait for book three!!",161,73

I was immediately sucked into Nevarre's world and came to care about him, his friends and wanted the mystery of the Specks to unfold.  I found Forest Mage to be a satisfying continuation of Nevarre's story. There are still many questions unanswered (as a mystery fan, I love that) and Nevarre is maturing into a truly flawed but real young man.

I also didn't mind the plot twist regarding the doctor (but NOT the way it was resolved).

The underlying moral question this book poses is: how complicit are we in others' suffering because of our wants? The corollary question to the answer is then: what do we do about it when we recognize our complicity? You're not going to find these questions addressed in your typical thriller or mystery.

His books are far less focused on cheap thrills and gore than some of the other authors that I've read, and the results can vary from time to time. There is usually a good amount of hope behind his work. With this book, the heart is there (I really don't mean that as a pun) but it takes a different form.

There are, however, a good build up of characters, a good surprising twists to events and the love between the two protagonists is endearing. I have never been moved emotionally by a thriller, but this one almost moved me to tears at the end. There is forgiveness, giving and redemption. A very high value of human nature indeed.

He receives the transplant successfully; now his life begins to become very strange & begins unravelling.

Though a very good idea for a story, there are parts in which the author leaves loose ends dangling. No justice for Dr. Death who apparently murdered Ismay Clemm? The beauty Violet, for the most part, simply vanishes shortly before the end. The end holds no great surprises. In fact, it may be a bit over the top as the love of his life, Samantha, re-enters his much altered life. Alas, possibly too late?

He needs a transplant. but I don't want to say anymore and ruin it. That being said, the story is brillant I love it just as much as his other novels. I'm glad I continued reading because if I had stopped in the middle, it probably would have recieved three stars, very low for a Dean Koontz book.

This one here is slllloooooow. You have to read 150 pages before something significant happens. There's lot of things that don't make sense and once the villain was revealed and her motives, I felt cheated. I even stopped within the last 10 pages to brush my teeth before bed--before actually finishing the book--something I've never done with a Koontz novel.

It simply left me scratching my head wondering what Koontz was thinking. The climax ended so abruptly, I kept thinking it would start again in the next chapter but no. THen, then romantic interest was a disappointment too. The book jacket was better than the book.  Worst fiction book I have read in long time. Sorry, Dean.

As a paranoid myself, it shows how one's mind can do so much harm taking a person to places where no one would ever hope to go.

Also, what was the point of developing Ryan and his girlfriend's love story at all?  They don't even end up together; apparently deep down she knew he was the kind of shallow guy would who take an unethically harvested heart??
And the ending was irritating too.  I get that Ryan was trying to make up for his previously shallow/money-rules-all existance, but come on, an orphange?  Real believable.

Why did Violet have to have the final showdown at Ryan's dad's house, a character we never really heard about until that last scene? Why did she get up and leave after beating him senseless and torturing him> What about all the focus on euthenasia and the fascination with the pictures in the folder?  Why the Poe fixation? These are just some nagging questions.

While I found the premise intriguing (about killing people for their organs), it seemed overly prosaic and pretentious at times.

people who have worked hard and become succesful seeing myths about themselves being continued by an author who seems to be drifting politically left with this work.  maybe he will catch up with steven king.

I wasn't too spooked by the book.  The worst parts for me were Spencer's apartment and the violence near the end.  Those parts were quite creepy, but that's to be expected in a horror/suspense novel.

At the very end of the book {don't read this if you don't want me to give a large chunk of the end away}, the author missed the point of life and faith and all that, and I am going to write to him and tell him nicely where he went wrong. =)

It is my privilege to witness to him and tell him no one can redeem oneself by good works!  If we could do that, Jesus would not have had to die on the cross, right?!  It is his righteousness imputed to us that we need in order to be saved.  Yeah!",192,126

He really didn't know that anything was not on the up and up regarding his heart transplant.

But I think he was trying to get in the popular mainstream and write books like other popular authors (Jodie Picoult-Change of Heart).  I am not sure what he was trying to do.

I'm not sure I let everything sink in the first time.  This is a very interesting Koontz and a little different from a lot of his.  The protagonist, Ryan, is a complex character and the story is told with a very tight focus around him.  Many things go on in the beginning to middle of the book that really aren't understood until the end and even then you should not be expecting the answers to slap you in the face.  The understanding of these things is more deep and subtle than a cursory reading will at first reveal.  It is there and readers should dwell on the meaning of this one a bit.
  Overall this would not be my first recommendation to someone new to Koontz but a good read for someone looking for something worthy of deeper consideration than the typical industry thriller.

As usual, Dean's humor is laugh-out-loud funny and the suspense builds and builds and grabs you by the throat until you are gasping for a breath.
Koontz is hands down the best psychological thriller writer this country has produced.
His prose nears poetry at times and his insight into the human dilemma is unparalleled.

But Koontz does a masterful job in illuminating how the five ""roots of violence"" can play an insipid role in our lives.  So, through the journey that protagonist Ryan Perry takes to self-awareness, we see in ourselves how a cultural psyche can mislead us to believe that more is better, and at any cost.  And while this tale is not about Wall Street, it is a testament to the power of those human ""failings"" of ""lust, envy, anger, avarice, and vengeance"", and worst of all the denial of truth.

I have a hard time believing a lead could be so stupid  and shallow as Ryan.

His security firm supposedly researched Dr Hobb and did not mention anything fishy?

Also, too may loose ends. What about Dr Death and justice for Ismay whom Koontz strongly implied was murdered?

Lastly is running an orphanage really supposed to make up for buying a heart from a murdered political prisoner?",101,180

I was surprised and happy to find I actually finished this one and while it lagged in several places, it held my interest. Koontz defintely did his homework about heart transplants and cardiomyopathy so for those interested in such it gave a glimpse of the disease.  I was a bit confused with some of the early apparitions and other strange happenings in his home but when I put that aside I found I wanted to know the outcome.

All in all, this novel is more like the ""old"" Dean Koontz although somewhat flawed and confusing at times.

Why is it that a whole nation plus countless others were responsible for the big bad thing, Koontz's villain only blames the RICH hero?  I also find it very unlikely once the hero figures everything out his life is changed so profoundly.

For the math problems, the book does not explain the logic behind any formulas used (rather than helping you understand the material, it wants you just to memorize it). Questions and explanations in the verbal section are equally confusing and illogical.

On the Mechanical section, many of the diagrams have ""printing problems"" making it difficult to answer any question involving measurements, circuitry, etc. Regarding problems where you have to identify the ""correct"" tool, the explanation tells you what the correct tool is (and its function), but explains nothing about the other tools and their functions (therefore, unless the SAME question comes up on the real exam, you're likely to get it wrong again).

Bottom line..........for the Math/Verbal sections, you're better off with a GRE or SAT prep book, and for the Mechanical section, try to get ahold of a High School physics textbook. The ARCO book is good only for the practice exams which you can take under timed conditions.",193,13

In short, the explanations stink (the editors routinely use oddball approaches in their math and skip whole series of steps) and there is not enough background material or pointers to references.
The entire mechanical comprehension section is lifted wholesale out of two freely-available Navy manuals and the test questions are just the examples that the Navy used.

As other reviewers have said, a book which explains certain math problems or english theory would help those who find they are lacking after taking a couple of this book's sample tests.  I would agree that an SAT book might be helpful as a companion.

And then there were the things we were asked to believe:  not only historical inaccuracies, but Adonis-Zachary, the shining hero of the book, predicting the Japanese invasions that would occur half a century later. Or an entire church full of ex-slaves interrupting their service to gasp, ""Oh God!  How beautiful he is!""  (I paraphrase).

There did not seem to be much craft used in developing the plot.  It appeared that the author had done his historical research and then needed to share that learning through the dialogue of his characters.  Writing in hindsight the author had material the characters would never have known.  Nevertheless, the information was inelegantly expressed through the words of the speakers who sounded too prophetic and preachy to be real.

His attempt to push a certain modern political agenda through his books conflicted with events of those times - and in the process alienated many of his faithful readers who enjoyed his previous agenda-neutral historical novels.

I wondered along the way how much actual Marine history played into the story, in terms of the fight to keep the Corps alive. (Interested enough to research that later.)  The problem is that the story wasn't compelling enough to have an ending that wasn't supported by the events that lead up to it.  390 pages of showing someone's emotions progressing in one direction so the reader can be tricked with a ""Gotcha!"" at the end.  Well that's fine, if the 'gotcha' seems plausible, but in this book it absolutely didn't.

SLIGHT SPOILER - The ending reminded me of 'The Partner' by Grisham, which had the same problem.  I don't read Grisham anymore, because to me that was a big let down.  The last two pages were not reasonably supported by the first 390 or so, and to me, that makes for a bad book.",201,13

I don't need the coda at the end, the wrapping up.

There are good insights into human nature, and into the nature of male love and lust. Good insights into Elgin and Blue and the way they feel about the woman Jewel. And why they do what they do. But all in all, it seems like a tragedy without meaning. Maybe that is the point, but it doesn't make me want to read more.

This is the opposite of a sermon. But it also is not a very satisfying story. Not because it lacks meaning, but because it lacks a well developed aesthetic sensibility.

It has been years since I have done this.  When I find a book that is hard to read I normally keep going because it will smooth out around the middle of the story.  This did not.  I was very disappointed as the book club which I had just joined had read another of her books the month before and they liked it very much.  Perhaps it was just this character in the story and not Carol's writing style. I hope so as I would like to try one of her books again.

What Orbit has done is to realize some old, familiar works in an electronic medium, using smooth and musical strokes. He's taken many big chances. Some of them worked out well, others not as well as one might hope. But he deserves kudos for taking a risk and for making some of it work.

Why would anyone who *likes* electronic music complain that it doesn't have live instrumentation? That's like complaining that jazz has no rock and roll in it. ""Reverence""? ""Second rate Vangelis""? so: you were disappointed that Orbit didn't create more of the kind of schmaltz you personally like. Yanni, anyone?

 I think of it as like a costume drama by the BBC of some excellent Victorian novel, not as it was first intended in it's own time but a clever reworking and marketing for a modern audience thus allowing some history a new voice and a new audience.

Sadly, this one really misses the boat.  Instead of benefitting from Orbit's prisitine production or from the depth of the original compositions, what this just manages to do is suck the soul out of all the compositions.  It is slightly better than downloaidng a MIDI file of the same piece, but displays the same flaccid lack of emotion.  It becomes a pretty self-indulgent exercise.
The ""single"" of Barber's Adagio is paricularly flat as an electronic piece, removing the tension of the dissonant strings and replacing them with rather flabby whooshy pad sounds.

It's touted as being a blissed-out compilation of sparkly, beatless remixes with a trancey flavour. Along with the visually stunning packaging , the record comes with some exclusive reworks of ""Barber's Adagio for Strings"" by Ferry Corsten and ATB. Corsten's remix provides the listener with a cohesion of banging, building progressive techno, fused with the epic Adagio sample.

The 11 beautiful classic compositions in the tracks of  this CD are transformed into modern-day masterpieces.  Orbit's lust for  subtle ambient sound is fully satiated in these works as he presses onward  for that perfect sound.
Not once, though, does he betray the original  flare of these pieces.

Even classical composers often create arrangements of other composers' works or themes (often times intended for other instruments), so it's really not a valid  review to imply that a NEW arrangement is simply not valid.

It wouldn't even  make sense.",83,47
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000046S1W,4.0,positive,"I've always felt that really good techno has many elements of classical music in it, and it seems odd that it would take so long for one of the techno crowd to try their hand at remaking classical music.  The results  are beautiful, yet tasteful and not exploitative of the material.
There  are some missteps.  Some of the tracks (In a Landscape, for instance) veer  off into sounding like a music major noodling on a cheap Casio keyboard,  and others (Adagio) are a little to respectful to be authentic.  However,  the others are terrific.  Xerxes is beautiful and some of the other  arrangements are really chancy and inspired.

I  believe that there is no need to rearrange pieces of classical music that  are perfect and complete in themselves. So I can only explain this CD as a  cash-in operation after the successful Madonna album.
My humble advice  is, to those who like easy-listening classical music: buy the originals  (classical CDs are often sold at a bargain price), since they provide a  much pleasant, authentic listening experience. To those who are curious  about ambient, buy any CD of the Orb, or Boards of Canada, or Plaid, or  even the classic Eno.",141,50

They have gained a more techno feel while still keeping their metal roots (ala Ramstein) and Liv voice is still as angelic as ever even through this techno sounbds. The problem is that they may seems to have lost their Gothic touch but , personally, I think it just transcended into something different but no totally ""un-gothic"".

Their music is qualitative very high, rich and listenable. These are things I unfortunately cannot say about this TOT album. First problem: the band creates an unnecessarly ""wall of sound"", much to loud (I don't think that Gothic means ""play it loud!""), unlistenable and which is covering by 50 % the vocals. Second problem: the techno-pop section is far from being original, copying electro-pop bands from the 80's. There are entire passages you could swear they are from Kraftwerk, A-ha or others. Third problem: I think there must be a limit of mixing different music styles. While it is proven that classic-rock, classic-metal or opera-metal is working very good, I don't think that techno-pop/metal or any other dance-metal will have any succes.

Vanessa Williams' interpretation of the Witch manages to be quite distinct from Bernadette Peters' while maintaining the standard Ms. Peters set back in 1987. Although her velvet tones do strike you as a bit smooth for the character - you can feel the underlying emotion in the larger numbers, like ""The Last Midnight""
Both Laura Benanti and Kerry O'Malleys voices are quite beautiful and add new dimensions to the characters of Cinderella and the Baker's Wife, respectively. Benanti's ""On the Steps of the Palace"" is much lighter and more ""girlish"" than Kim Crosby on the 1987 recording, which is refreshing to a listener who's become so attached to the original recording.
The only reason I haven't given this five stars is the quality of the recording itself. In many places, the recording feels a bit closed in as if you were in a small space, almost drowning out the richness of many of the actors' voices.
Overall, the recording breathes new life and energy in an already timeless musical and makes a welcome addition to any Sondheim library!",202,0

  This recording is inventively done and defiantly breathes new life into this score. The new additions on this recording are the first American recording of ""Our Little World"", a duet between Rapunzel (Melissa Dye)and the Witch (Vanessa Williams). I would have bought the recording just for this song. The new version of ""Hello, Little Girl"" is now sung by both wolves to Ridinghood, preserved on this recording along with many other tweaks to the score.
  Williams and McMartin are absolutely fabulous, breathing new life into there performances, as well is veteran actress Laura Benanti, Kerry O'Malley and Gregg Edelmann. While newcomers Adam Wylie and Molly Ephraim give a different twist on there characters, and are very entertaining to listen to,
the performance of Marylouise Burke is the biggest letdown on this recording.

It won a tony for best revival, but must have been due to some other factor than individual performances. My biggest bone to pick was Vanessa Williams as the Witch.

She sang in tune, and she hardly missed a beat, but there was nothing there. The only role I really liked more than the original cast was Cinderella. She was amazing and earned her acclamations.

In fact, it belittles it.  I agree with another reviewer when they said it seems like a bad community theatre production of this masterpiece.  It seems like this production is more ""family-oriented"".  The show may be comprised of children's fairytales, but it is in no way a ""family-oriented"" musical.  It has very adult situations and complex concepts, as do other Stephen Sondheim musicals, that are notsuitabl for children. Making it more ""family-oriented"" makes the usually genuine characters overdone (i.e. Vanessa Williams' interpretation of the Witch) and almost hokey, cheapening the overall message.
I suggest buying the Original Cast recording from 1987 with Bernadette Peters and Joanna Gleason.  Chip Zein may be disappointing, but you won't go wrong with that CD.

Still, I got this soundtrack for my birthday, and I have to say that I'm fairly impressed. I love it so much, but certain things do get on my nerves. It also annoys me, though, when people complain about the different people doing the characters- whenever a play reopens, there are going to be new interpretations of characters. Also, complaining about the people's voices is rather rude, in my opinion, unless you think you could do a better job.
Recently some idiot scratched my CD, blanking out the last three songs. I like this CD so much that I am going to buy another copy- which is the highest recommendation I can give.",162,14

Narator: someone please shoot this guy! what is with the whole ""ok since the stageing isn't as creepy as the old one i will make up for it"" i don't like him
Witch: two different interpritations but still good either way
Prince: better then before
Cinderella: best ever casting
Jack: ok is it posible that this part is played TOO young? if it is i think he has done it.
Little red: good choice
the step sisters: they don't have the comedic timing as the last group
Jack's mother: why is she so old if jack is so young? *not that the actress is old she just sounds old*
THe Stepmother: to annoying!
over all its like the stageing has changed the music so much that if you are used to the original cast that you can't sing along the first time you hear it....its only annoying if you sing along with your music like i do!

The only cast members who hold their own are Laura Benanti and Kerry O'Malley, and even then, it's difficult sitting through the other performances.

In my view, the answers are yes and no.  Into the Woods is a great, great score that is wonderful to listen to over and over. It just keeps getting better.  Some say it is one of Sondheim's more accessible scores.  I don't know about that, but it doesn't lack for richness and depth.
I think this version and the original cast are much closer than some of the other reviewers.  Some actors are better in one or the other.  The key to me, however, is the role of the Witch, who sings a few of the most poignant songs in the show, and here I give Bernadette Peters a big edge over Vanessa Williams.  Williams voice is pleasant and very professional, but bland, to my taste. Peters brings verve and passion to every note, and her singing is the highlight of the original cast recording.

Quite frankly, there is little in this recording worth recommending above other recorded versions of the work.
 Why bother altering the music for a show which was orginally so funny and poignant? And why make the Witch an Aretha Franklin wannabe? And why is Jack's Mother so bored? All these questions keep floating around my head as I take it in.
 Doubtless many will disagree and say it is better than the original but, apart from a couple exceptions, it really is nothing more than a curiosity.
 I really, REALLY wanted to enjoy this recording but simply cannot. Maybe I need to listen to it more or maybe I just object to the changes, but this not worthy of the name Sondheim.

I think the little riding hood played by Molly Ephraim was great, just as innoncent as she can be.  My favourite, Jack, the sad young lad played by Adam Wylie was a bravo, his voice really fitted how I imagined Jack to be.  All the casts are great, but Vanessa Williams didn't do as well as I expected.  She's got an excellent voice, but her role (the witch) was a bit distracting, considering the witch is evil and she didn't really bring out that sense of villian...only she looked a bit silly.  She still did a great job in the singing, but her acting throughout the show was not as great as her voice.

Vanessa Williams is weak as the witch, she lacks the passion and luster Bernadette Peters brought to the role. SHe has her finer moments thought among them ""Stay With Me"" and ""Last Midnight"". One of the finest perfomances on the disc is ""Our Little World""  a song from the London production added to the revival.
Other highlights are the Bakers wife, Cinderella, and the wonderfully innocent Little Red. The actress who play Little Red brings something new and fresh to the role and i think really perks it up.

I was afraid when I heard that Sondheim had made a few changes to the show. I believe that the original cast album is a gem. The changes include 3 little pigs, a second wolf, minor alterations of words to a few songs like ""On the Steps of the Palace"", and the editon of ""Our Little World"" in act one.

  Lee Ann has dyed her hair (a bad job at that) and changed her genre to a sort of blusie/jazz/pop type of thing and it doesn't work.  Her talents are surely going to be wasted.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00007FPKG,4.0,positive,"There have been several Ramones tribute albums, but this is the first one to feature ""big name"" acts.  The results are varied, of course, like on any tribute album.  The young ""pop punk"" acts Green Day, Rancid and the Offspring perform good faithful versions of the songs.  Most of the other acts try to put their own spin on the songs.  The most interesting variations are, to me, by Red Hot Chili Peppers, Garbage, The Pretenders, Tom Waits (Grammy nominated for his song on this album) and John Frusciante (unlisted bonus track).  Most of the songs are at least decent, except for Marilyn Manson's dirge-like version of ""The KKK Took My Baby Away"", which is god-awful.  This CD should be of interest to Ramones fans who don't mind hearing their heroes songs played in different styles.",136,14

Manson's ""The KKK Took my Baby Away""... one of my personal favorite Ramone tunes). If you find this used for around $6 or under (like I did)... it's worth it. Otherwise there are better ways to spend your time and money (I guess that's why there are about 53 used copies for sale here), especially if you do not have the original Ramones recordings of these cuts (classics!!).

Stones freaks like myself salivated over the prospect of hearing these multi-disc collections, which promised outtakes and unreleased recordings and live songs from the late 1960s, and early 1970s. Instead we got this knock-off Christmas release that amounted to nothing more than theft. I bought 'Rarities' as soon as it came out (for full price). I had already bought 'Sucking In The Seventies'.

There are so many good tracks on this collection like the awesome live version of beast of burden, the dance version of miss you and many others.

However, this to me, is only worth getting if you enjoy hearing live recordings.

I've heard boot-legs, and I've seen boot-legs videos, and although they are sort of cool to have, or to see at a friend's, they all lack in quality. Be it performance, or sound quality.

This CD has some of the very best live recordings I've heard from Korn.

All of you who are contemplating the purchase of this album should look the other way.  Chances are you already have all of these songs (except maybe Proud).

Have to say that this disc, while not bad, still leaves a lot to be desired. It's a very underwhelming first listening and while it does grow on you, it's not a disc that you're dying to listen to again.

For me, the three-part ""Another Brick in the Wall"" is great, but doesn't hold up to repeated plays.

That being said, the band's performance of ""One"" is a nice addition ... just wish they did a more complete version of the song.

My biggest complaint about the disc is the mix overall. The performance at CBGBs in NYC is a poor live recording, folks. The vocals are way down in the mix and the bass is all over the place, virtually on top of everything else. No excuse with the recording technology available these days.

Nice try Epic, but this one just ultimately falls flat.",167,7

Therefore, Sony now has all control and can release JUNKY COMPILATIONS like this whenever/however they want now. The songs are excellent, DO NOT take this review as me bashing KoRn...

As of the release date (May 9, 2006), Korn hasn't even mentioned it on their website!

On to the album itself... there is nothing rare here. It's basically their greatest hits - live. Many Korn fans might even have tracks that are on this album. The live version of Metallica's 'One' is here - the same 'hidden' track on 'Take a Look in the Mirror.'

However, that doesn't make it bad... It's fun to listen to, and it's always a bonus when you can hear the crowd singing along, especially the chorus. But still, this shouldn't have been made at all. Had Jonathan Davis been involved, I'm sure it would've been better.",156,11

I wanted to go to the Buddha Bar, but was told to go first to the Cantine du Faubourg.  Disappointment.  The Mezzanine was fabulous.  The music, the atmosphere, the experience.

Some of the lyrics where heartfelt, but most of it was shallow and just like everything else you've heard before. In fact the whole cd feels as if you've heard it before, and better elsewhere. This is frankly boring and very mediocre.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,"After the success if headlining tours and the platinum ""Don't you Fake it,"" I was certainly expecting great things from RJA. Their first single wasn't too impressive, taking the sound I'd come to love from the band and turning it on its head. However, Pen and Paper, the second song from the album I'd heard, restored my faith. Regardless, I'd be picking it up as RJA has always been on the top of my list of bands along with 30 Seconds to Mars and Monty Are I. However, ""Lonely Road"" was too different ... I didn't recognize one of my favorite bands.

The guitar melodies were often repetitious and without knowing exactly what happened with Elias, I start wondering if the sound was so dramatically different because of his departure. Ronnie pumps up the vocals this time around, hitting notes that send chills of joy down your spine but the music behind the voice didn't progress the new sound.

Why the new sound anyway? Platinum records mean nothing is broken ... so don't fix it. It sounds like they wanted to move forward musically - they just too big of a step into a sound I neither recognize nor enjoy.",200,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001G7QXYS,2.0,negative,"First off I've been really excited about the second album since I finished listening to the first album. So I ran out to Target the morning of it's release, dropped 10 bucks, and ran to my car. I tore the packaging and almost broke the case, anxious to hear it.

Sadly there is nothing ""blistering"" about this album. I try to stay out of bands' personal issues, but I would say either the absence of Elias or the new producer (regardless of his success with Daughtry) severely maimed the ""signature RJA-sound"".

I kid you not as soon as I finished the last track (which I found myself checking how much was left a mere two minutes into), I fired up Don't You Fake It and jammed out.

Why 2 stars?  Well I'm loyal to my boys and the quality is there. All the songs are done well. Nothing sloppy. But now I'm listening to Cat and Mouse and it kicks the piss out of the new album.

You can find instances of some of these songs on Youtube. Tell me how a 53-year-old Susanna Hoffs can look like a foxy 30-year-old! She looks amazing and sings better than ever.

I've gone back and looked for Under The Covers Volume 1 as a result of hearing Volume 2. Brilliant stuff. Sweet's pop sensibilities are sharply attuned to reviving some pretty cool stuff!

Note to the artists: If you want to do good covers, choose poor songs and reimagine them into something better. Do not cover Tom Petty and then sing like Tom Petty. Do not cover classic Yes (what were you thinking)?

I especially don't understand Hoffs since her cover of Steeler Wheel's ""stuck in the middle of you"" and Lulu's ""to sir with love"" is nothing short of phenomenal. She can do so much better!

CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,4.0,positive,"Sweet jesus, I love this collection. Sue and Matt (or Susie and Sid) are such fans and the love comes through. Hearing their voices blend on the Yes song, ""I've Seen All Good People,"" is close to bliss. And we get the channeling of lost souls like Alex Chilton (""Back of a Car"") and George Harrison (""Beware of Darkness"") with great reverence for the original. I was fortunate enough to see Susanna sing Linda Ronstadt in a lunchtime honky tonk in Nashville in 1984, so ""Willin'"" is a special treat.

Since Vol. 1 were 60s songs and Vol. 2 covers the 70s, we can only hope that Vol. 3 (""See you next time!"") will take on the 1980s. Maybe Matthew Sweet will try The Bangles' ""Dover Beach.""",127,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B002B9L8FE,2.0,negative,"I totally agree with several fan reviews posted here that Vol. I of this collaboration, which focused on some very interesting song choices from the 1960s, was excellent, but their move into the 70s falls flat. Unlike another reviewer here who thought this album looked great on paper (but was disappointed when he heard it), I didn't. Good God, who would want to hear this very sweet-sounding harmony duo cover unique, un-topable songs like All the Young Dudes and Bell Bottom Blues? Not me. But I gave it a try, and was right -- most of these cover versions do not work. The only song I really like is ""Back of the Car,"" and maybe that's because I am not familiar with the original by Big Star. Their attempts at country rock fare little better. Buy Volume 1, and maybe they will have better luck if they move on to the 1980s. Also buy The Thorns album, on which Mathew Sweet works with a couple of other male singers on a fine album of original, Crosby, Stills & Nash-style songs.",180,7

Unfortunately, they stayed SO close to the originals that it just isn't very interesting to listen to repeatedly. Both of them could easily add some additional harmonies or arrangements or even guitar or keyboard solos to add some spice to the tunes. I hope they are willing to experiment more, if they try this idea again. I'll certainly be more cautious about my next purchase. Meanwhile, I'm going back to original versions.",93,8

What do you get?  One of the most unnecessary recordings in history.  There is an effort on every one of these songs to duplicate note for note, instrument for instrument, and arrangement for arrangement, the classic originals. They are really talented musicians and do a credible job for the most part, but in every single instance the original is far better, and in a few (""Willin'"" in particular), the cover is disastrous.  It is clear that these two have great taste.  My advice is to find each of these originals and make your own mix disc.  It will be awesome.",131,12

It was wonderful hearing them redone by people who were young the first time these songs hit the charts.
Probably the best song on the album is Rod Stewart's ""Maggie.""  Sung by Susannah, a new depth of feeling is added.  But there is hardly a substandard selection on the whole album.  It's just great listening all the way through.

It also has some new raditude(not my favorite album)like songs such as Autopilot very catchy song. Theres the fast and fun ""Burning my stack"". I'm not suggesting this album is for everyone but it is for those die hard fans who own have early and later weezer albums and even the Alone Albums.

Sadly, at a time when most successful artists would be maturing from great pop acts to timeless classics, Weezer continue to trash their reputation with the same pandering attempts to look cool in front of today's hipsters. You guys are getting a little bit too old for that. It's starting to look creepy.

I wear these all day, sometimes 18+ hours and they never get uncomfortable at the end of the day. I only take them off to sleep and shower.

They do start to wear a bit on the top inside of the bra just below the nursing clasp, since that part folds down each time you nurse. This eventually causes the seam to give but even then they still work well.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,"After nursing for 2 years, I really wanted a molded cup padded underwire bra to give a better shape and make me feel a little more normal again. I searched for a while and am glad I purchased this one. The price is great for a nursing bra and I have seen much more expensive ones at specialty stores and online. The underwire is comfortable and although I wish it was slightly more padded, I was happy with this. It looks great under any garment, but the sides do come a little higher than some of my other bras, so I have to make sure that the shirt I choose covers it under my arms. It is easy to nurse in and once the top is clipped back up, it doesn't take long for the padding to smooth out again. I've worn it out after about a year, as the underwire is starting to poke through the fabric, so it's time for a new one and I would definitely purchase this again.",172,43

Very disappointed in this one.,71,62

It's a scratchy material around the seams and in order to get it to be supportive it ends up digging into my sides under my arms and I'm not a large woman. On top of that, the cups are a bit larger than expected, especially in comparison to the size of the band. And then trying to get my breast uncovered is a whole other mission. I have to fold the covering a few times and literally tuck it under my breast for it not to be in the way so my baby can eat. The only reason I didn't click ""I hate it"" is because the feature of having underwire (which is what attracted me to the product) is nice, but the rest is very badly designed in my opinion.",135,63

I really debated purchasing this bra, but I am so glad I did.  It is extremely supportive ( a rarity in nursing bras.  Go figure.)  and very comfortable.  The cups are not too thick and easily hide nursing pads.  Yes, they do fold down with a little more effort, but the support is well worth it. The band size does seem a little small, too, as others have noted, but the size I needed did fit.  If you need support, this is an excellent nursing bra.",112,70

I prefer just an ""outer"" lining that connects to the bra strap when you roll down the cup to nurse. This bra has a complete circle inner lining with a circle cut-out for nursing.

This offers so much support, I was a 3rd before pregnancy and I don't know if this compensates for the aimed increase in size but that is what I ordered and it fits great!

I'm going to keep it in hopes that maybe i'll swell up large enough to be able to fit into it. The bra unclips and only folds halfway down, right across the nipple. Not sure if thats because the inside straps attach to both sides of the cup or not, but i see myself having to fight with it in order to pull it out of the way so my kid can nurse. The other bras I've bought, when unhooked, fold all the way down without  being attached to the center of the bra on either side.

I originally ordered the 38D because that is what all my other bras are (and I measured myself to double check). I wore it for a few weeks and decided it was just too small (there was no cleavage separation and the band was leaving an imprint by the end of the day) so I ordered the 40DD. Much better fit and fine for daily wear. I have been wearing this one daily to work for a few weeks now and I am perfectly happy.

Also, because the inner support (the part that remains when you fold the cup down) encircles the breast, I just find it a bit harder to get everything where I need it even for pumping (but it's doable).

I have two of them and they are the only ones I will wear.  It seems a little tight at first but does loosen up some as it's worn a bit, which was perfect because it seemed a little small for the size I needed.  When the outer cups pop down the inner holsters around the breast are complete, rather than just one sided, and are great for nursing.  Only downfall of this set up is it's not particularly easy to get your breast back into the cup with one hand in any position that looks even slightly normal (a little awkward for nursing in public, but can be done).  Overall, I love it and recommend it!

Edit and star change: after years of using these bras exclusively, something changed. I don't know if they changed manufacturers or what, but the new bras I've ordered this year have been horrible.

Closet thing To a normal bra that I have found.  It has molded cups so it hides the nursing pads well. The snaps are good an sturdy. So far it's been a great bra and reasonably priced. I've always worn underwire bras as have never found a bra without underwires that gave me support. It's a great bra for daytime under your normal clothes. The only thing that is kind of annoying is the molded cups. While I like them for hiding nursing pads and such, it is a bit annoying to have to push the molded cup down out of the way to nurse or pump. that's the reason I have 4 stars and not 5.

I used the sizing suggestions given by others and it fits perfectly.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry,B0007SMRUG,5.0,positive,"I love this bra.
I was searching high and wide for a nice neutral t shirt nursing bra that gave good support and was high enough on the middle and sides to contain my breasts.  I am a 34D, and it can be hard to find a decent full coverage nursing bra that lifts and seperates my breasts that seem to be made of lead these days.
This bra really does the trick.  Its extremely supportive without looking so.  The underwire and the inner sling that resembles a triangle with an opening for your areola really keeps your breasts in place- and thats with running around a bending over to pick up after a 4 year old all day.
Even with it being so supportive, the straps aren't ugly and thick and the bra looks normal.  Its also really cheap yet made well.  The snap is easily undone with one hand.  It is so comfortable that I literally slept in it the first night I got it and wore it the entire next day-and it left no red marks or chafing in any areas.  Most bras always irritate me at night.  Highly reccommend!",193,275

Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,"Small, but perfectly formed, that's Al Guthrie for you. This is one of the splendid series of novellas published by Five Leaves. In KILLING MUM Carlos Morales does odd jobs for people. Several of those odd jobs involve offing people. When Carlos receives a padded envelope one day it's a good news, bad news sort of affair. The good news is that a mystery client will pay him 20,000 to kill Valerie Anderson. The bad news is that Valerie Anderson is his mother. Oh, and there's more bad news. He suspects the woman he loves of being the one who wants his mother dead. Dark, warped and funny, and with a surprising number of twists and turns for such a short book. I read it in one sitting, alternately giggling and gasping. Strangely enough I had a whole train carriage to myself by the end of it. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.",153,1
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,"You have to keep mum about Killing Mum because, as other reviewers have noted, it's hard to say too much without spoilers. It's about a for-hire hit-man who is given a lot of money to kill his own mother. He's both cool about it and curious. He's prepared to do it but would like to know who wants him to do it. Is it his wife, is it even the mother?

Guthrie's writing is strong on dialogue, which many writers find hard to do convincingly. Some writers talk tough but their characters just end up sounding manufactured. Elmore Leonard is a master of great, natural dialogue, and while Guthrie's characters are a world away from Leonard's, they have that same tough-sounding realism. I liked what one reviewer said about Blood Simple - that's a really good comparison. Like the Coen Brothers' movie, it's gritty noir yet also occasionally comic. And the characters are totally real.

By the way, one reviewer referred to problems with the Kindle version but I've read the Kindle version and didn't see any problems at all. Or maybe I was just too engrossed in the story!",190,2
Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,"KILLING MUM is a short, sharp shocker. TRUE BRIT GRIT!

The novella is  as tight as a very tight thing and is a spin off from Guthrie's cracking novel SAVAGE NIGHT. It's the story of a  man who is paid to kill his own mother.

Like SAVAGE NIGHT, KILLING MUM takes a violently  absurd and tragically comic situation and gives it a couple of  dark and bitter twists.

It's like having BLOOD SIMPLE transported to modern day Scotland and is a rush of a read.

Electronics,1905512694,5.0,positive,"A true modern master of noir and crime fiction, Allan Guthrie packs a wallop with his gut punch of a novella, a sweet little package from Crime Express called KILLING MUM. Carlos is a man who arranges killings. For a fee, of course. A letter arrives addressed 'Charlie', a name only his wife and mother use for him. The letter contains the down payment and instructions for a job. But there's a hitch... The intended target is none other than Carlos' mother.

And it all goes downhill from there. Guthrie is able to amp up the suspense right from the get go and it just never let up throughput the 96 page run, and yeah, thank the maker it isn't a novel length story because, damn, it'll nearly wear you out as it is. Any longer, you might just need an ambulance.

The story line here was just incredible.

I can't write too much as I don't want to give spoilers.

I will say that the character development is very good for the main character. I enjoy the way this author draws you into a story, forcing you to turn just one more page to find out what happens next.

Disliked:

Again, hard to tell without spoilers, so I will just say that the author used a particular type of formatting that kind of gave away the 'twist' way too early.

There is no deep bass, but I expected that.  Also, the surround effect is nice especially when you have the spakers placed on your work table at near-ear level.

Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,"Just spent the last month checking the internet for portable speakers to take on vacation.

I bought them this past Saturday at BestBuy and hooked them up almost immediately to my Sony MD Walkman.  All I can say is ""What a surprise.""  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for compactness, good sound and an incredibly great price in travel speakers.  I only regret not waiting another day because Circuit City here had them on sale for $17.99 and I also had a $5.00 off coupon which would have brought the price down to $12.99.  That would have been an even more incredible bargain for what you are getting for the little bit of money being spent.",187,3

One of the key things for me is portability, and here is where this system shines. The speaker/amp package is great for travel or just toting about town. To start with it is very light. The form is also also thoughtfully designed.  The two speakers clip togeather to form a package slightly thicker than a standard CD jewel case.  This also protects the papery speaker fabric.  The tiny amp is sculpted so that it fits your hand, and the wires are plugged at poth ends and detachable.  Be sure to have a clip or rubberband around to keep the wires together after you dissassemble.

True given the rather limited output, these would not be suitable for a display at a convention or a raging party, but they are perfect for a hotel room, (quiet) dorm or office.  Yes, there are three wires (2 for the speakers the other from the music source (ipod, mp3)) but the advantage is that you can space the speakers farther apart then with other speakers I've seen.

The problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange. Bass is nonexistent. It's like listening to a pair of big tweeters.

Electronics,B00005LOIP,5.0,positive,"I enjoy watching dvds on my laptop,but lugging my desktop speakers in a bag did not appeal to me. Now,I literally slip these speakers into my laptop case's outer pocket,and I'm on my way. They snap together,and are one and a half inches at their thickest. I show off these speakers every chance I get,and the reaction is always one of amazement. Now while they're not the equal of my desktop speakers,they're 25 times better than my laptop. The surround sound effect makes a real difference when heard for the very first time. While a bit pricey for most people,if you own a portable dvd player,or a laptop,
you will increase the value of your product and your audio-visual experience many times over. I also use them with my mini disc unit. In new york city,where things have to be just a little bit louder to be heard,these speakers impress!!!",150,14
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,"Easily the best portable speakers out there and probably the only portable speakers that aren't more then glorified headphones.  The sound is rich and full, although the bass will hardly rattle your teeth.  The speakers are incrediably compact, about the size of a double cd jewel case.  The I-Mac-esque color scheme is an aquired taste (Am I the only one that misses the days when computers and electronics only came in Black, Silver, and Putty?).  For a pair of speakers to throw in with your laptop, MP3 Player, or portable CD player there's nothing better.
PROS - Superior sound
  - Very Compact
  - Easy to set up
  - Fairly long battery life
CONS - [light] plasic and cardboard construction
  - Somewhat pricy
  - Weak bass
  - Questionable looks.
  - Seperate amplifier
  This is a very good effort and I hope Sonic Impact tries again.  Make it with heavier plastic, integrate the amplifier into one or both of the speakers, raise the bass a tad, bundle it with a compact DC adapter (or better yet a USB power option) and lower the price into the sub-50 dollar range and this would be a breakthrough product.",194,15

I found the unit to be very user-unfriendly.  The remote control is poorly laid out, and performing a simple fast forward/reverse task is painful.  The unit does not automatically switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio (wheras my Panasonic does), so I have to manually set the aspect ratio each time I switch from a widescreen DVD to a VCD or a 4:3 DVD.  I have read reviews that tout the AD-800 as a great toy for a technical person due to its many user-adjustable parameter settings. But I think the unit had so many user-adjustable parameters because it lacks the intelligence to set them automatically.
The Karaoke function is very limited, as it has no ability to adjust the key and no vocal assist function.  I had high hopes for the AD-800 due to its many advertised features, but I am quite disappointed by the poor quality control and user-unfriendliness.",181,6

The beauty of this is that it does a great job converting PAL<->NTSC. While not ""Region Free"", it has the complete look, feel,` and quality of the Malata. In fact, if it wasn't for the Apex label, it seems like it's EXACTLY like the [expensive] Malata. It does the 16:9 correctly in PAL<-> NTSC, and you can adjust the aspect if needed! Great features for the price!
There are some issues with the Progressive scan, but overall it does a relatively good job. Heck, I would say that for the price, it does a FANTASTIC job. Also, with some of the newer high-end TV's, some of the deinterlacer's on the TV's are better than the DVD players anyway, so you may not need it in the future!

I put a music CD disc in, and it also sounded great. It is a very good value for the money.  The only problem I have had with it occured when I tried to play a DVD disc that I rented from a supermarket.  It was just too scratched up for it to be played.  According to ""Consumer Reports"", some DVD players can play damaged DVDs and damaged CDs.  I suppose that also depends on how badly they are damaged.

It has a few drawbacks, however.  Some expected, some that need fixing in the next generation.
The expected (but still a little disappointing)
- limited focal length lens means that elements outside the very center of the picture are blurred (barrel distortion)
- No flash for low light situtions
The real problem:
- it loses your pictures when the battery drains down, i.e. its memory is volatile.  Flash memory is so cheap, why did the designers make this choice?
- There is no early warning, actually no warning at all when the battery is too low.  In fact if the battery gets low it will still take pictures as normal, then it freezes up, and all your pictures are gone.
Caveat emptor here - a great product in so many ways, but make sure you replace the batteries early i.e. Every 50 shots or so.  Its not a cost issue, but you will lose your pictures beyond hope for recovery, even though the camera seems to continue to act normally.",201,14

The second inconvinient is that inside houses, when the light is not perfect, the camera shows an error and is unable to take the picture (presumably because of the lack of light, as it doesn't have a flash incorporated).

Took it on a family outing over the Labor Day holiday and came back with great pictures to share with the family. Nothing publication quality but certainly good enough to show people what the kids did for fun over the weekend. The Blink lens distorts the images around the edges, but for snapshooting, it's at least equivalent to the old Instamatics and Polaroids. It is surprisingly good in low light, tho the shooter must take extra care to hold it still.
It's main advantage is its size and weight, both of which are negligible. Coupled with the generous memory (100 to 400 images, depending on resolution), it INVITES you to carry it constantly and shoot pictures of everything.
Two points to remember: (1) It's easy to wrap your hands around the camera SLR style and make your fingers part of the scenery. (2) It's so small and handy that it's easy to lose. I have a nightmare of leaving it in a shirt pocket and sending it thru the washing machine.",182,19

Also with my laptop, it seems Numlock and Fn are both needed to enable this keyboard's number pad, but I don't plan to ever use that feature anyway.  Occasionally I bump the Fn key in the corner which causes some of the number pad keys to not work, but another press toggles things back to normal.  I might pop the case open and tape over the Fn key.  If you install the provided software, you get some bonus keys along the top.

I just configured some mouse and keyboard buttons to the way I like. The keyboard/remote are very well built in both style and quality as well as key touching, even on the bigger keys, such as Shift and Space. The MX900 is very similar to MX700 that I have been using daily along with G7. While the bluetooth MX900 features long range coommunication, it suffers from very short battery life, 1 day for normal usage, which is unacceptable today. However, the battery charge is also very short too, 1/2 hr. The remote keypads is handy as remote control for DVD/CD playback.

My son has a pair of the above earphones. I couldn't believe how comfortable, so quickly went the $33 route...cheap at half the price. They stay in, sound fine, and most important of all...after an hour or so, I am still not aware of their presence. I also have Sony street phones, which I enjoy but these are far more compact and unobtrusive.

I can wear them forever, and they feel great, whereas the others hurt my ears after 5-10 minutes, or don't even fit.  These never fall out, they sound amazing.

The only downside::
After a  year or two, of hard use, the rubber has ripped in two areas exposing the wires that run to the earbuds.
The grey part that actually goes in your ear, can fall off about once a week, and is often hard to find, and they are impossible to find anywhere for sale.

I can only imagine how big ears have to be for these to fit on properly.

The rubber ear cups work fine but the ear loop that is supposed to keep the earphones on my head are too big and are not adjustable so they just fall off like my other set.

Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"If you're the kind of user who can always carry the (included) carrying case, then my comment will be irrelevant; enjoy the earphones, as they're as good as EX71.

However, I usually keep my earphones wrapped around my iPod, and unless you are super careful, the over-the ear hooks make it susceptible to tangles.  The same hooks also make it cumbersome to untangle.

Also, the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while I use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses.  It's doable, but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears.

Finally, the white color goes well with the white iPod models, but after a few months, they tend to show the grime all too well.

My advice: I don't think that any (claimed) audio improvement over EX-71 is worth the extra hassle.  If your heart is set on this model, get the black one.",150,47
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"These earbuds are absolutely terrible. First, the wires constantly tangle. I bought these f-ing things so that I could stay motivated while exercising.

In the past I had used these earbuds while lifting weights. Under such circumstances, the experience is awful. Not only do they come out of your ears when you perform any slight movement, but since the wire is meant to hang around your head (and thus, behind your back), good luck trying to lie down or sit back against anything. AWFUL!

For the first time tonight, I decided to run with my mp3 player. Every few minutes, I had to fidget with the ear piece so the buds would stay in my ears.

With enough perspiration, this rubber cover can come off. Unfortunately, when I removed the earphones, the rubber cover did not come with it, and the gray cover stayed in my ear.

Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"I loved this headphones. They were the excellent iPod headphones replacements. They have got fabulous reviews. But just do a google search typing ear buds hear. All serious studies done by different universities and doctors are concluding that that due to how close the ear-buds are present to the eardrum, they effectively magnify the sound by between 6 and 9 decibels compared with traditional over-ear headphones. Unlike headphones that go around the ear, these go inside the ear canal and can be louder because you're projecting that sound into a much smaller cavity with the ear speakers closer to your inner ear where we have a delicate system of sensory cells that are responsible for initiating the hearing process. Those cells are very, very sensitive to noise damage. Earbuds allow sounds in the environment to leak in, often causing the user to turn up the volume.",146,70

Recently I lost one of the silione earbuds during a flight. Could use the earphone without them but it was very uncomfortable. Sony charges $8.95 for a SINGLE large earbud and $6.95 for a SINGLE small or medium.

That's a little on the ridiculous for a small piece of silicone that costs mere pennies to produce; not to mention you don't even get a pair. They are hard to find also.

There is no way to adjust them, unfortunately, and it only gets worse when I sweat during a workout because then they are sliding off!!  I also paid full price for them at the time (January '06), and now they are discounted, but even at that price, they are of no use to me.

Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,These ear buds were great!  They were cheaper on Amazon and they sound quality is excellent.  They arrived in a timley fashion.,22,78
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,The earphone is pretty good and it gives exceptional sound quality. Its easy to use. Sometime it comes off the ears but its not a major problem. Overall its very good.,31,79
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,It does a very good job considering the price. I use it everyday for my commute. I take trains to work and I can listen to my Ipod without blowing off my ears. It is worth every penny. You can get better noise cancelling headphones but they are bulky and north of 100 bucks.,54,80
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"The sound quality is tinny. The treble range is fine, but the bass response is absurdly bad. To listen with these things is like  leaving out entire instruments. So if all you listen to are, I dunno, flutes, go ahead and buy them. But for normal music, they're really not even better than the standard iPod headphones.",57,81
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"The sound quality is excellent, don't get me wrong.  These earphones put out clear treble, deep bass (without washing everything else out) and have a well balanced tone that I have not found in most other headphones I have used.  The backround sound cancellation from the in-ear style is not perfect, but does a better job than most earphones.  My biggest problem: the fit!  I opted for the over-the-ear style because I thought it would be better for an active lifestyle, and this would be true if they actually fit me where my ears are.  The length of the earpiece is not adjustable so if your ear varies at all from the size they make, they simply don't work.  In my case (others may have different a experience) the actual ear piece almost hits my earlobe - almost an inch too far down for these to fit right.  Huge mistake not making them adjustable Sony.  Bad Bad Bad design.  It is a real shame because the sound quality would have made these some of the best headphones I have used.",180,82
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"I am not an ""audiophile"" - I just need headphones that do a decent job of isolating me from external sounds and that are very mobile.  So I can't comment too much on how perfect the sound is from the Sony's.  But my amateur opinion is that they sound great!  The sound isolation is not too bad, but not too great either.  I'd say they attenuate incoming external noise by about 50%.

I own a pair of Etymotics ER*4 MicroPro Earphones (cost: $300) and the Sony MDR-EX81LP's a have much deeper bass response. I use the Etymotics correctly (i.e. press them ALL the way into your ear until your feel that sucking feeling...), and when I do so I can barely hear what's going on around me.  So the Etymotics are much better than the Sony's for sound isolation.

I haven't had a problem with the cords or durability, but I've only used the headphones about 10 times (no visible wear so far).

I love them and am glad I bought them. I prefer to use them when total sound isolation isn't necessary.",183,83
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"Great fit and sound.  Does not work well with a cell phone adapter (2.5mm to 1.5mm).  Do not buy for a cell phone, but only for a device that uses 2.5mm.",31,84
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"The ear piece is flimsy. Sound quality is good. I do a lot of running and the things kept on popping out of my ears, and if they don't stay in your ears you cannot hear the music, well you can but the quality drops from a 8 to a 1. I gave it to a friend of mine that just sits around and listens to music.",67,85
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"These earphones are awesome. They are far superior to anything you would get OEM with your MP3 player or other audio device. It takes a little time to get used to these earphones and getting them to fit comfortably, however, once you do they don't fall out and sound great before, during, and after workout. The only disadvantage seems to be the shorter cord to the left ear. This is designed so that the main cord goes down on the side of your body rather than your chest, but takes a little while to get used to and to hide the cord away in your clothing.

I wish the cord was shorter like with other Sony earphones so that I could plug it into my in-line remote and not have a 2.2m long cord, but without a remote these are a great length for just about any type of use.",150,86
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"I got an ipod several month ago, and want to boost the bass for my music, so I decide to got this new set of headset. It sounds good and clear, but according to the bass, it's really not as good as my original ipod set.",46,87

Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"The best pair of ear buds I have had so far, the sound quality is great and actually has a large amount of bass. With the cords wrapping behind my ear I no longer have to worry about the buds coming out whenever the cord gets caught on something.",49,89
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"Indeed the sound quality on these is excellent. But I am on my second pair, namely because of the cord attached to the right earphone.  After a few months it loosens and inexplicably develops a 'putty' like quality which soon peels away from the inner wire. Sony should have fixed this issue long ago.",54,90
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,The headphones have good sound and the buds themselves fit into the ear well.  The problem is with the ear pieces that fit over the ears.  They fit either my wife or me.  They evidently were designed by an engineer with big ears.,43,91
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,I have purchased several earphones for my ipod shuffle including the Apple small earbuds and the Altec Lansing  IM302 and these are the best in terms fit.  They also sound great.,31,92
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"Let me start by saying that I'm pleased.  These phones definitely have improved bass response compared to the last ones (61's) that I had from Sony... but they have definitely sacrificed some of the clarity you would expect from the stuck-in-your-ear type earbuds.

The pros: The carrying case (after i figured it out) is very cool.  The over-ear hooks are nice.  They fit very good and block out a lot of the outside noise.  Decent Bass repsonse.

The cons: The technology that Sony has implemented in these earbuds definitely improves bass response, but it comes at the cost of some clarity.

Don't get me wrong, they sound good... they just don't sound GREAT...  but definitely worth the price.",118,93
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"The packaging is great, and the headphones come with different sizes of earbds, and a neat little carrying case.

It is a very comfortable set to wear.

All of which makes it a real pity that the sound quality is terrible - it sounds tinny.  It has none of the quality of sound of the standard iPod earbuds.

So I rate it 1 star for sound quality, but bumped it up one star for the package as a whole.",79,94
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"I have had about 4 pairs of Sony headphones from the basic earbud ones to these with the wrap-around-the-ear style.  I've loved every pair I've had, very comforatble, very nice sound quality, which is why I've been so disappointed every time they have died.  These headphones WILL stop working within a year.  I've tried it 4 times, it's true.  I use them for working out, running, or just when i need to be alone with music, and they've worked just great.

Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"I just bought these as a gift for my brother, I've had them for almost 2 years now. These headphones produce a crisp, quality sound. I wear them when I run outside and the only drawback is that you cannot hear anything but the music that you are listening to. Someone could sneak up behind you and bonk you on the head and you'd never hear them coming if you had these headphones on! Ok, unlikely scenario, but the description should give you a good idea of how outside noise is completely eliminated. I highly recommend these headphones!",98,99
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"1) The over-the-ear hooks don't really fit over my ears -- they sort of balance on top of the ear.  They are not adjustable.  I'm an average-sized male, so it's hard to fathom this design.

2) The buds pop out of my ears when they get wet from sweat from exercise.  All 3 sizes of plastic earpiece covers do the same thing.

3) The sound quality is mediocre; bass response is especially weak.

4) After less than one month's use, the volume on the left earpiece dropped to around 1/4 of the volume of the right.

All in all, I'm thankful therefore for Amazon.com's return policy; I'll use the money from the refund to buy a different set of earphones.",120,100
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"The Ipod earbuds just don't stay in my ears, which I found very frustrating.  These are great.  There are three options for the pads, so you will find one that fits. I was concerned from the picture that the bar that hangs down and connects the ear hook to the earbud was too long.  It's not adjustable, but it isn't an issue.  The design makes these very adjustable and comfortable.  Also, if you have only heard your Ipod on the standard earbuds, you are in for a treat.  The sound out of these is just fantastic, so much better than the original earbuds.  The price I paid was about the same as buy.com but Amazon was shipping for free, so this is a better deal.  I strongly recommend these for anyone who wants comfortable earbuds, with a marked improvement in sound at a very reasonable price.  I can't wait to hit the slopes with them!  Enjoy.",156,101
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"First, I bought these because I HATE earbuds inserted into my ear, so I thought the over the ear feature would be great. However, the sound quality from these is very weak. The stock iPod earbuds have a much fuller and richer sound. To get any usable sound, I have to pretend these are ear plugs and shove them as far into my ear canal as possible, which is exactly what I hate. Even then, the sound is hollow and tinny.

Second, the over the ear feature doesn't work for snot. I cannot get the freaking loop to fit over my ear and have the earbud in a comfortable position in my ear at the same time. Plus, this is a non-adjustable element. I think my ears are a pretty average size and shape, but I can't use them. I guess it doesn't matter anyhow, since  the sound quality is so poor.

The carrying case is a nice touch, but about twice as large as it should be.",168,102
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"These head phones are great. The sound is clear and it fits great on the ear. It comes with three different ear bud size that allows you to change between them and use whatever is comfortable. However, there's one thing that I do not like about it. I worked in an office where there are carpet floors and since there's metal around the head phone near the ear buds, static electricity transfer up to the metal rods quite often. If you like your ears being shock or if you can keep your feet still then go for it. Just giving everybody a heads up...",104,103
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"I bought these headphones for my ipod because the bud type headphones always come out of my ears and are terribly uncomfortable.  The ear hook design is a fabulous improvement.  The customizable earbud fittings also ensured these headphones have a very comfortable fit.

The sound is great from these headphones although the volume the headphones produce is lesser than what my iPod earbuds produce.  For the most part this is OK.  The only time this is an issue for me is when I am on an airplane - announcements from flight attendants and from the cockpit drown out the volume even when my iPod is at the highest levels.

The only thing I do not like about these headphones is the earpieces have different length cords before reaching the single cord that goes to the mp3 player (or whatever you are listening to).  This is picky I know but it makes it difficult to wrap up the headphones and requires that I strap my iPod Nano on my left arm when I run.

If I need another pair of headphones in the near future and want to stay in this price range, I would probably buy these again.",198,104

Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"Definetely great sound, superb clarity even if you take it to its limits. Basses and trebles are nicely balanced, and a natural sound is obtained. There are several BUTs though, the most important one being the difficulty of use. The back cable is a mistake, and the cable extension connection is always pulling your left ear down, not a pleasant feeling when you want to move your head. Another problem I had is an interesting one. One day I saw a cut in the coating of the cable and that got bigger and bigger. That coating is supposed to hold the inner cables together but ex81's is made out of play-doh. Now there is a huge part only with the two inner cables and I can stretch the rest of the coating to cover that part, it is that soft!",140,106

...one thing i have noticed is a very faint crackling in the left heapphone, although it may just be my computer, as i havn't noticed it when listening to the ipod. (or a defect with this set of headphones)

....as several people have already mentioned, the ear hooks are a bit large, but are still a comfortable fit, they just stick out the top a little bit.

Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"After trying these out for 3 weeks, I dislike them.

For the gym: They don't sit in your ear very well if you're running, and you need to push them back in when they are getting loose.

If you're just sitting around, they are ok, but they still seem to fall out. The flaw in the design is that the piece that goes behind your ear is non-conforming. This means that it retains the shape it had when it came out of the box. When I bought these, I thought the could be bent to stay in a certain shape, but that didn't hold true.

I've tried these along with other Sony portable headphones, like the MDR-G73LP - never buying any more Sony's again! They always seems to miss something that makes it annoying. I'll try buying those over-the-ear Koss headphones instead...",142,111

If I wear them as they were intended, inside the ear canal, then the ear piece sticks out from my ear where it serves no purpose. I played around with them and realized this problem could easily be fixed with a shorter shaft about half the size. If you have large ears these would fit and feel great.

Big disappointment.

The sound is really quite poor.  It is tinny and high, almost piercing at higher volumes, and totally lacks bass.  Plugging my old earbuds into the same device without adjusting the volume and comparing it to these Sonys just underscores how poorly these perform.

The fit is also lacking.  When running, there is nothing which breaks the revery of hitting your stride like constantly having to shove an earphone back in your ear.  They hang over your ear like overcooked linguini. I could even excuse the poor sound quality if they stayed put for more than 1/4 mile of running.

But if you use them alot, they quickly fall apart and break (and thats from daily use, not from abuse). The cord is made out of some fabric that, as another reviewer said, almost seems to dissolve. It's like a stretchy form of rubber that quickly splits and rips.

And where the cord meets the actual rubber that goes behind your ear, the cord rips and breaks off from the earbud, and the only thing keeping it intact is the wire itself.

First off, you need to stick this in your ears properly else you won't get good fidelity.  Sound is generally well-balanced.  Bass is not booming (this is good), but treble is still a bit overemphasized which leads to crackling (typical of cheap 'phones).  Volume is lower than most cheapos -- which can mean a lot of things -- but still acceptable.

Ergonomics are good: the buds fit in the ears nicely, provides good isolation to outside noise.  I don't know how comfortable these are for sports, since sweat inside the ear canal gets annoying.  For other things they're pretty good: though you're not gonna forget you're wearing them, it's like wearing silicone earplugs (which I do for swimming for a prolonged period of time, so it can't be that bad).

Overall, a good value, but not quite there yet.  I'm not spending $100+ for the Shures, so I'm just gonna keep looking for my whale.  I'm giving it 5* because it fulfills my expectation of what $30 can get me.",187,149

The bass is clearly not as pronounced as the 71s, but that's not necessarily a terrible thing.  Had I never heard the 71s, I wouldn't have anything to compare these to.

However, the design, fit, and quality of these is muuuuuuch better than the 71s.  Scale of 1-10, the sound quality of the 71s is a 10 and the 81s (these) are an 8 or so.  But as for design, I would give these an 8 and the 71s a 3; so the nod definitely goes to the 81s.",124,151

(And here I have to note that my player is a Creative Zen Touch, which, according to the reviews I've read, many self-proclaimed ""audiophiles"" believe has the best sound quality of any MP3 player currently on the market.)  Granted, I'm no expert, but it's funny to think that the included earphones--which many of these same audiophiles apparently regard with contempt--sounded a thousand times better to me than these more expensive, ""higher quality"" earphones.

I tried using the two smaller sized nubs, which made exactly no difference; same with wrapping the cord behind or in front of my head. They just kept falling off, which would jerk me awake as I was drifting off to sleep. Since they slipped off after five or so minutes when I was sleeping, I cannot imagine how awful they would be if used during physical activity. I found the sound quality to be fairly abysmal as well; there was an omnipresent tinny sound that I constantly heard over the three days that I used them. They did a terrible job of blocking out airplane noise, despite advertisements to the contrary. These were a waste of the $30+ MSRP. I will never use them again.

They are still good enough to notice that you need would need to change your bitrate from 128 Kbps to something higher. As the other reviewers have mentioned though, they do sound slightly better and more normalize than the EX71's by reducing the bass a bit. This may or may not be good for you as some of you may like more bass of which then the EX71's would be better.

The earclips are of rubberly/plastic material that easily bends and the buds themselves twist making sure that there is a perfect fit.

HOWEVER, this unit also comes with the plastic piece that fits over year ear.  I got this model because I run, and wanted the extra piece to help keep it secure.  Well, maybe it's just me, but when the plastic piece was properly behind my ear, the buds popped out.  And when the buds were popped all the way in, the plastic pieces weren't resting behind my ears correctly.  Had the same frustration as the other reviewer, as it ruined my run.

If you buy this product, be ready to use your TV remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote. In addition, the user interface of the player is horrible - much worse than my old Sony. I returned this the day after I bought it and exchanged it for the Sony SLV-D370P, which includes a remote to control the TV and has a great user interface.

It has a 3/5 rating! WHY?

Still pictures are GREAT with proper lighting (my room has little lighting, so I needed a second source.) (Quick Capture)
Shading Hues
Video Mute

I merely followed the instructions in the suse webcam wiki at [...] and I was up and running in a few minutes, chatting with kopete on a yahoo connection to a friend in another state.

Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,"It's pretty good quality. Easy to set up and use, but you get what you pay for. The video quality is pretty good and it adjusts to my indoor lighting pretty well. Sometimes I have to shine some light on myself, but usually it's no different than when I'm doing homework. I don't really use the microphone because I already have one that is probably better. Hoever, I do have one issue. The focus on the camera is manual so you have to adjust it yourself. It's fine when you're just going to talk at the desk and usually just sit there, but if you want to move around and show things, it'll be a major pain, but I guess it's good for what you pay for.

Sometimes the light indicating that it is on will stay on all the time, but that's usually on start up. Once you open a program that would use the video like skype, it will turn off after you're done.

I purchased this to supplement my PSP and new Sony-Ericsson w850i phone.  It works like a charm...

Not only was it a snap to integrate with my set top box but the recoring options ie. bitrate, protocol etc. give you the opportunity to record for any phone that you may own or your PSP or whatever will play a list of A/V formats.

What I love about the unit is that you can record off of your TV or DVD player in the exact format that fits your playback device.  My Sony phone works well with 3GPP so that's what I just recorded '8 Below' in and WOW, there's no stuttering or pixelation...it's great...what can I say.

You can record from any a/v source, even those old VHS tapes with copy protection, straight to an SD card. The only drawback is lack of choice for recording file type. It would be nice to have MPG2 or AVI as choices, especially if you want to burn your results to DVD. The sheer ease of capture in a single, portable device that doubles as a card reader is like having an old school field recorder in your pocket. No computer, no drivers, no expensive video cards, no hassle, just click to record.",109,8
Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,"SanDisk definitely had the right idea with this straight to media memory recorder. Unfortunately this is either an early model or they missed the boat.
The remote is hit or miss and selects twice per click most of the time. Starting the recording works well but you cannot stop it. So unless you have a small memory card and want to take everything until full (which is when it will stop recording automatically) then this is not the unit for you.
I hope SanDisk has an upgraded model because this would be great if it could be controlled like a video recorder should be.
The price was right and it was worth a try but this model is not worth even the cheap price.",124,9
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,Unit is a great replacement for a VCR plus has better advantages. I use with 16gb SDHC card and yes it works. Originally purchased to use as an auto DVR for my car but it won't continuous record without having to delete recordings. So I set 8 daily scheduled recording to repeat then just delete smaller files every so often./ nice unit and does what it says it will. Good quality and so small too. Nice unit and very inexpensive.,80,10
Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,I use this to record my favorite TV shows onto my PSP. For less than 30$ you cant beat the portability and convenience.,23,11
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,"I purchased this unit to record our church services from the output of a multi-camera switcher.  It instantly gives us a file that's ready to post on the internet each week.  Of course there are other ways to do this, but being able to hit stop and instantly have a file ready is a tremendous time-saver.  The quality is everything we need for a web video posting.

I have a second unit at home for time delaying TV shows from a set-top box.  The home unit has some issues responding to the remote control, but continues to work.  Once I have the recordings, I can play them back from this box, or from other TVs in my house connected to a media player.  Another use I have found for this box is making recordings for my iTouch.

I would really like to have a unit such as this that encodes a component HD signal with  H.264 compression.",157,12
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,"We bought this figuring it would be a great option to a subscription dvr if it worked. We didn't expect much, especially after reading the reviews. We were pleasantly surprised. It works much better than expected and the picture quality is great! Recording at highest quality works great on a 19inch tv, and while not crystal clear on a large (27"" tv) it is good enough to watch a recorded show. I would not call it HD but it is just as good as my still kodak camera takes video, or even my flip video camera.

The remote is not great. In fact it was almost impossible to use at first. I than did some research and found a forum suggesting the obvious. Replace the battery. Made a huge difference!

After reading the product instructions I realized this device would not do what I wanted. I have several Sony semi-pro mini dv cameras with worn out tape drives. I am looking for a way to use them with an inexpensive PVR that records to AVC/H264 format which this one does not. I connected the device to my video system for the test run. It came on but would not respond to any command from the remote. It has no input method other than the remote. I tested the battery and it was dead. I bought a new battery and it sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. The remote is really cheaply made, without true buttons, and sometimes takes multiple tries to get a response. In a video shoot struggling to get your recorder on is a nightmare. The product pamphlet suggests going to a sandisk address online for firmware updates. They do not exist. The product is out of production and unsupported. Amazon authorized return for refund but save the headache and don't buy this one.",186,15
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,"For the price, this is an amazing little device and it does just what it says it will do.

I bought it so that my daughter could add video content to her iPod and it's been great for that.  I've also created videos for my phone.  The video even looks pretty good on a PC.  In it's ""High Quality"" mode you can record almost 4 hours of video to a 2GB memory card.  You can't expect DVD quality.
  The clunky part is the remote.  All record functions are through the remote, so you have to use it.  Unfortunately it is one of the worst remotes I've ever used.  You have to hold it in exactly the right position to get it to respond.  Still, you get what you pay for.

None of the IR Emitter codes worked reliably turning the my satellite receiver on and off.

I read the reviews and knew the video quality wasn't that great, but I was still expecting better than grainy cellphone-type footage. This is even though I had it set to the highest quality video setting.

I also wish I had read the technical specifications more closely. I thought this device was supposed to be able to REPLACE a VCR, but it can't connect to an antennae of any type so you still need a separate video source, i.e. A VCR, which almost totally defeats the purpose of getting this device at all.

I knew there were going to be problems when I saw that the ONLY video connections were mini-stereo plug ports on the back - no s-video, no-coaxial, not even RCA. On top of that, the tiny remote is incredibly FRUSTRATING to use.

I only spent $40 on this, but even at that low price, this device was COMPLETE AND TOTAL GARBAGE.

The fact that it has no buttons, forces you to use the remote, which has to be pointed directly at the box at about to inches in distance. But I don't mind the defects above, what really got me mad was that I had to press every single button about 20 times until it finally picked up the signal.
It was not a battery problem because I changed them, and one day I wanted to record a show and it took me ten minutes of pushing the ""on"" button to make it work, so I got sick and frustrated, grabbed a screw driver and ripped the remote in two. now I have no remote which means no v-mate.

It does pretty much play back the same quality video that was it received to record. TV playback is better than on a computer but I don't believe it was really meant for computer playback.

Unit also locks constantly - have to keep pressing the RESET button in order to get it to half-way function.  Buy something else - I would purchase this unit if it was $5 dollars",112,12

I use a good tripod and a shutter release and I still get horrible photos.
Another thing with this lens is that a ring on the outside of this device came undone. I have to push it back to be able to focus. It seemed it was glued on.

So if you are looking for a lens, please pass this one up. You will just waste your money. Do not go cheap on your lens and they should treat you right. I am not sure if i can do anything about this lens. But I plan on saving up and purchasing a better lens for my Canon Rebel T3.",162,10

That said, I am very happy with the solid barrel and the optical properties of the lens. You will need to use some sort of support, though, best a tripod, otherwise you'll end up with blurred pictures. I took some amazingly sharp and big images of the moon, but due to the slow speed, even a picture of Venus will be blurred, not to speak about faster moving stars. The lens performs quite well in bright daylight, but you do need to have a good tripod.",115,17

Obviously, you're going to get better results from the Canon, and if you want to sell your photos this is going to be useless.  It hasn't got any bells or whistles, no autofocus, no image stabilization, so you're going to need a tripod too.

I would characterize the results from this lens as 'barely acceptable, sometimes'.  But still, if you wanted to take professional style photos, you weren't going to get that from a $90 500mm lens.",105,19
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,4.0,positive,"I bought this lens when I first bought the camera.  I did not know any better.  It is a shame that good lens are so expensive, but after a year of using the camera, I think, it is best to wait until you can aford a better lense.

I am a beginner at photography, but without a stablizer built into the lens I cannot get a clearly focused photo without a tripod.  Also without auto focus it is only good for still shots.

JMHO",84,20
Electronics,B000VC7EVU,2.0,negative,"I was a little naive in the purchasing of this lens. I went around and asked a lot of different sources on getting a relatively inexpensive telephoto lens beyond 300mm. They all said the same thing- there is no such thing, if you go cheap you are wasting your money.

They were right. I was extremely disappointed in this lens. If you think you're going to freehand this without a tripod, there is no possible way to do it. If you set it up against something stationary, it's still going to cause a snowy white image. You have to use your tripod or the shot is wasted.

The quality of the photos would rate approximate 6/10. They generally appear a little darker with quite a bit of grain.

It's nice and compact in design but if you care about the quality in photos, stay far away from this lens.",149,21

- the bottom piece holds to the rest of the body armour with rubber tabs. These tabs keep coming out and I have to constantly put the tabs back in place.
- Feels really cheap but it's inexpensive after all
- The lens hood protector pice does not fit a 77 mm as advertised
- The bottom pice has to be completely taken out to replace the battery

SO yes inexpensive but you get what you pay for",184,4

Electronics,B000ZLULOY,5.0,positive,"This does fit my Canon xsi quite well. A little bit tricky installing, but now its on. Lens installation wasn't hard either. I really just wanted something to protect the body from bumps scratches. A previous post complained about having to remove it to replace the battery. Personally it seems quite easy to remove the bottom, plus my battery tends to get several hundred pics so I don't see it to be a huge deal. I don't see myself using the rubber lens hood. For less than $10 I think its a bargain.",93,10
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,"I purchased the Camera Armor through Amazon for my Canon XSI last year, at the same time that I bought my new camera.  I have been very disappointed in the Camera Armor.  It does not fit my camera well.  The Armor makes it difficult to operate some of the features on the camera. The extensions on bottom piece easily slip out of the slits in the main part of the Armor that are intended to hold it in place; the bottom piece of the Armor falls off easily.  This is aggravating!  The part that would protect the lens is bulky, and I have not been using it.  Some areas of my camera, specifically the LED screen and the pop-up flash, as well as the buttons and dial, are not protected at all by using the Armor.  Further, the rubbery material seems to attract dust!  I have put up with this product for almost a year, and now I am looking for something else that will be easier to use and will protect my camera better.",175,11

But the price was reduced to under $7.00, and I thought I would gain if any part of it was usable.  Alas, I found no part worth using.  Every part either falls off too easily, makes camera use awkward, and/or contributes nothing to protect the camera.

I believe that this product was honestly conceived and the best materials were used in construction.  It just doesn't work for me.  I ordered it to give it a try, without high expectations.  I have no regrets.",96,12
Electronics,B000ZLULOY,4.0,positive,"The armor does what it claims to do, that is to protect your camera with a rubber coating that gives it a better grip.  Just like having a nose mask for your car, this product covers your camera with a nice protective shield.  All the buttons function normally, except for covering the button labels. So, get to know your camera's buttons a little before putting on the armor. The lense hood is too small for my Canon 28-135 USM lense.  The only surprise was that I have to remove the base covering to replace the battery.  I'm thinking of buying a second one for future use because i plan to keep my T1i for a long time. I give it 4 stars because it's not tight fitting and you have to adjust it a little on occasion.",137,13

In my opinion the frosted PerkyO is better, more flavorful than the original brand but amazon needs to sell both.

Until this product I just gave up on cereal because I just didn't like the taste of other cereal. Either they were just so hard or too fake in taste and chocolate cereals got old very quick.  But this honey nut sans gluten changed all that.  Absolutely the best cereal I have come across and still haven't found any other cereal to meet it's caliber.  My toddler who isn't gluten free loves it.

I also found that when crushed you can use this as a noncooking pie crust. or any recipe that requires bulk. (bread, or graham crumbs)",120,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000EW0XGK,4.0,positive,"I almost didn't buy this from my local high-end grocery store because the price was so outrageous, but I'm glad I decided to go for it.  This is one of the better gluten-free cereals I've had.  It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful.  It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals, nor does it have that familiar ""cardboard"" texture those of us with celiac know all too well.  This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.

I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it -- of course, I can always just add some myself -- and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable.  I'll buy this again.",170,3

Not sure why the reviews lump together different flavors and packagings...  Anyway, I liked 'em.  Good flavor, spicy but not overpowering, good snap.  The smell... well, they smell like spicy dried meat.  It isn't bad but you wouldn't want to wear it as a cologne.  Or maybe you would.  I mean, I don't know you.  Maybe your girl is into that.  It isn't for me to judge.  Anyway, I'll be buying more in the near future.

They made the best beef stick I've ever tasted. Cowboy style smokies, twisted on  the ends, this is the real deal. These little fellas are the perfect snack on that long cattle drive or between rodeos. Every bite has that perfect ""snap"" when you bite into it. Don't even try to compare these to any inferior meat stick. These Ole' Smokies, are the bee's knees of the meat industry. John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Chuck Norris, and John Bassalone would be proud.",111,67

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"I just received these today and I will say that the taste is very good. It beats out most other beef sticks I have tried for taste. However, the slight ""film"" it leaves in my mouth after each bite is slightly icky. If it wasn't for that film, then it would definitely get 5-stars. Not sure if it's just the batch I got or that the sticks are cold, so maybe if I warm them up a bit the film texture goes away?

All in all, great product! Although I was a little disappointed I didn't receive a free sampler like some of the other reviews i saw on here :(.",111,71

Consistent flavour.
I accidentally ordered the honey-stung instead of spicy, which to be honest, are horrible.
My dog loved them, though!

Good for the price, but of this brand I suggest avoiding honey stung and sticking to spicy which ARE great.",43,76
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,2.0,negative,"Fast shipping but the beef sticks are too soft, I expected is harder inside likes the other brands. The ingredient is good, but I don't like the meat softy inside.  it tasted weird.",33,77
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"The honey-stung ones are bland and not really to my liking, but these teriyaki ones combine the nice texture of a sausage with a sort of snappy skin with a slightly spicy, sweet, and slightly savoury teriyaki flavor.",38,78

Also, the texture of it is dry and crumbles in your mouth, how is this possible? Shouldn't it be chewy?

I have no idea how the product is prepared but I can tell you the final product is not worth the price nor the time.

After trying 2 sticks I have put the rest in the trash already.",87,81

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"The outside of these is simply perfect for a mild meat stick: the honey gives it a nice sweetness and the wrapper has a nice snap to it when you bite into it. The inside, however, tastes almost exactly like a Slim Jim. I find Slim Jims to be a guilty pleasure, so I was ok with this, but these do taste like they are made of cheaper, fattier meat than what I prefer, so I probably will not be buying this product again.

If you really like Slim Jims, give this a shot. Otherwise I would pass. Giving it a four because it's exactly as advertised and quite tasty, just not exactly my thing.",115,89

These are the tree words that best describe these sticks. I was definitely expecting these sticks to be dryer and chewier.

I got one of these in 4 days ago and it lasted for all of 2 and a half days.  I just ordered another package.  These have a high fat content which you can taste when you bite into one.  The taste is predominantly salty with a spicy kick and a noticeable, but not overpowering, hint of honey.  Additionally there is a subtle acid bite,  These are good right out of the bag but they can also be used in cooking.  I chopped a few up and added them to pancakes- delicious.  They would probably also go good in breakfast burritos, cous cous, or rice.  You can't go wrong with these babys.",127,93

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"I think these are great, but the packaging is so so.  It's a bulk pack.  They are not individually wrapped.  You have to put them in smaller ziploc bags to keep them from going stale.",35,96

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,5.0,positive,"I learned about these from a co-worker after he made a bulk purhcase of several kinds of beef sticks a year ago.  He spread them around and so I got to sample a variety: I've ordered the Honey Stung four times since then. Two other co-workers have also ordered them on several occassions this past year and they're ""believers"" too.  Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills brands and they're all superb!  As long as you don't eat the whole bag, I'd also call these ""Atkins friendly"" as well, as that is also a motivator for me ordering these so many times (other than them being just being great, well-seasoned snacks).  Buy 'em, you'll love 'em!",118,99

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"I was a little skeptical on ordering the teriyaki sticks version based on a couple of reviews but, I am happy I did. They were a soft stick as someone said but had a nice crunch when you bit in. The teriyaki was milder than others I have ordered and they were more smokey but they are called ole' smokeys. I did not get the greasy mouth feel that someone said and it did have a pleasant tasting after taste. All in all, worth a 4* rating... but it could be a 5 based on individual tastes.",97,102
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"These snacks are very different than, say, Slim Jims. They are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there. There was a nice hint of spice laced with honey.

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000FYVKUA,4.0,positive,"I bought the Buffalo Bills Teriyaki Ole' Smokies beef sticks because I absolutely LOVE beef sticks, especially teriyaki, and I thought this would be a good buy - good quantity for the price.

The teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful. I also loved the texture, it was very soft and tender.

The only bad thing I'd have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy, fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth, which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to FULLY enjoy the product. Aside from that, I may still order it again. :)",109,104

A small residual portion of most bites resists pulverization by chewing and needs to be spit out.

Yes, they are a bit more tart than some green grapes, but I personally enjoy a grape that is not completely sweet.

I'm not big on energy drinks - if I want a lift, coffee is my go-to.

I was sorely disappointed.  I couldn't even get past one sip.  If I want apple juice, I'll just go and get me a regular old apple juice, thank you.  I'm not big on artificial sweeteners and while I'm aware that stevia is natural, it still has a strange taste to it.  Even my boyfriend, who has gotten used to beverages with stevia, said he couldn't get past the first few swallows either. It tasted unnatural to him as well.

It is carbonated and not too sweet. It is 70% juice.  I shared a can with my husband. His comments were sour but sweet. He asked if it was diet. I told him about the stevia and he said that was probably the taste he was noticing. Overall, I like it.  It is the type of drink I might get at a sandwich shop more than purchasing a case.",134,16

I brew it in a solo cup with an ez filter. Less mess, less waste (of water. I don't like the amount of water I waste rinsing away coffee grounds.)

Received a nice email that explained the grind was ""pre EkoBrew"" and they admit to it not working well with their single serve basket. That being said, they apologized and suggested for us to use less coffee with a smaller cup setting - as well as offering us a refund for the inconvenience.

For those of us who grew up in the south in the 40's through the 70's, this was a staple at the breakfast table.  We did not have it everyday but when we did it was a treat.

The secret to making this sausage taste right is in how you prepare it.  First, don't use a pan that will allow the sausage to stick.  Use either a well seasoned cast iron skillet or a non-stick frying pan.  Heat it until the sausage turns light brown and starts to stiffen.  Basically, cook most of the moisture out of it. If you are going to scramble eggs into the cooked sausage, mix between 4 and six into the pan.  Don't over stir the eggs or they will be mealy or crumbly.

I have the Delonghi Latissima (the older one, not the new square one released last year) and while it takes a little bit more force to close the door, compatibility has not been a problem. It's hard for me to imagine it fits one machine and not the others...
As for the coffee, it's OK- doesn't compete with that amazing vanilla seasonal variation nespresso released this past year, but it's not as bad as the cherry variation either. Its definitely not as strong as the Ristretto or the Appreggio but has much more flavor then the cosi and some other the other weaker blends. I would most compare it to one of the new Lungo blends taken as a short pour instead of the lung pour.

I have ordered a box of Cremoso to have at my desk as my own personal ""stash"".  My co-workers like several of the other varieties of Ethical Coffee, but my hands-down favorite is Cremoso.  An added bonus is that Ethical Coffee Company (the name says it all, doesn't it?) makes their capsules envinronmentally-friendly and biodegradable.

No problems with the capsules fitting. I am using a Gran Maestria.  There is a little popping sound as described by ECC but in my machine it is quite faint.  No problems closing. You have to give it a more firm push than the Nespresso capsules.

3. We have a brand new Nespresso Pixie. These capsules continue to get jammed in the machine and we have to reach in, struggle with the capsule to pry it loose before we can make another coffee.
4. Since 10 capsules are packaged in one plastic sleeve, the moment we open the sleeve, air comes into contact with the remaining capsules minimizing their freshness.

I tried the 3 strongest options and they were all week. Had to do short pulls and a 3:1 ratio was still not equal to 1 weak nespresso cap.

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B007JFMIWW,1.0,negative,"First impression, Stila sounds more like a medicine name than the name of a Cookie Bar.
The taste was fair at first, not enough fruit filling, and then a strange after taste, probably from the Sorbitol (Sugar substitute).

Sorbitol is not an ingredient that I prefer in my foods as it does have some side effects: Sorbitol can be used as a non-stimulant laxative via an oral suspension or enema. As with other sugar alcohols, gastrointestinal distress may result when food products that contain sorbitol are consumed. Sorbitol exerts its laxative effect by drawing water into the large intestine, thereby stimulating bowel movements.[3] Sorbitol has been determined safe for use by the elderly, although it is not recommended without consultation with a clinician.

The crust or cookie portion is very dry and crisp to the point of being difficult to eat without creating a mess.

The moniker ""cookie bar"" is a bit misleading as my resident expert on cookies, my 4 1/2 year old grandson tried one bite and promptly gave the Stila bar back to me, exclaiming that it was ""yucky!"".

They were very different from anything else on the market at that time I loved them.  They were chewey and low fat (at that point in time low fat was never an issue). They were not low calorie.  Anyway I use to get them as a special treat.  Unfortunately they disappeared from the market place.

Recently I found these. They were like the ones I had way back in the 1960's. I was delighted to find them in Blueberry, which is something I love.  They have a texture more like an oat cracker with a bit of fruit jam on them.  Very nice combination.

Now that I have had a few days to adjust to the texture, I can say that they are not bad tasting, in fact they have very little flavor period. There is a light spread of filling in the middle which is the only thing that gives the bar flavor and by light spread I mean that the bar is actually hollow with some ""filling"" spread on the inside. Overall, it is not a bad light snack. I will finish off the box that I bought, but I do not think I will be buying any more.

It worked fine at first but, after one or two months of use, started to experience water leaks of increasing severity. At first there were drips outside of the carafe. Then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints. We put the whole machine on a metal tray--to make clean-up easier. Finally it got so bad that, fearing an encounter with boiling hot water and/or the risk of an electrical shock, we stopped using it.

In the end, I was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket (it's a circular one-piece with a tiny hole in the middle) from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug. I then inserted a filter, coffee, and poured in hot water from a stove-top kettle. While this sounds ridiculous, it's a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine.

Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,"This product just does not work very well.  By the time it gets to the bottom of the pineapple it is no longer round.  I was oddly shaped and blow out the side of the pineapple a little. The instructions say to twist it as you press down, but that does not really work. It has two metal supports that make it hard to twist.  it just did not work very well at all.",74,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B0000CFMKF,2.0,negative,"I used the Pineapple Prince Pineapple Cutter and Corer once and wil not use it again. It is sturdy, but it is a very poor design. First the instructions tell you to turn the cutter in a clockwise direction. However, the serrations on the cutting blades point to the right, meaning the tool needs to be turned in a counter-clockwise direction to cut properly. Second the vertical aluminum parts that form the handle are about 1/8"" thick and they are attached to the outside of the cutting blades which means they rip through the pineapple. This results in a pineapple that is very difficult to slice. This could have been easily avoided if the handle was attached to the inside of the cutting blades.",124,22

The ac adapter is for the ceiling display only.  When you change the battery on the La Crosse, the clock and ALL settings are lost so I returned it and bought the ""SmartSet Dual Alarm AM/FM Clock Radio"".  The ceiling time can NOT  shown right side up with the clock facing you, this is like most other ceiling clocks so watch out. The La Crosse has the most advanced ceiling display as it can be twisted all 4 directions, but cannot be twisted enough to use the clock with the ceiling display right side up.",127,0

It works fine, has no problem getting the ""sky signal"" (we can't even use cell phones here) and I especially like the ""ceiling time' (it projects the time onto the ceiling). The only thing I had to get used to is the alarm setting mechanism. The in-between setting does not set the alarm, you have to slide it all the way....and the alarm has an increasingly louder signal, so you can't be slow at turning it off (unless loud noises don't bother you in the AM.) Mine looks just like the picture. It always has the right time and I don't have to mess with it. What could be better?",121,6

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,"This is probably the best atomic projection clock if all you want is a time display function. I have several of of this model. It has a bright-enough projection display, can do 24-hour format (unlike Oregon Scientific models), relatively easy to setup (for an atomic clock), and the most affordable.

As is with most digital clocks, setting up the alarm is a hassle and I do not use it.

Negative #1: The power-supply is only for the projection and all setting is lost when battery is changed. The trick is to replace one battery at a time and quickly to retain the settings.

Negative #2: When placed behind you, say on a bed headboard, the display cannot be rotated enough for proper orientation while sleeping. There is a plastic tab inside the projector that can be forced broken to override it.",141,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001MHL1S,4.0,positive,Item works exactly as described. It actually got the signal from Colorado very quickly once I realized I needed to turn on the wave. Buttons are easily hit accidentally which can cause the clock to change to 24 hr time or turn off the signal receiver.,46,10

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"This is a superb organizer for storing gift wrap and ribbons, packing tissue and tape. By hanging this stuff in a closet, I have freed up bureau space and eliminated the crushing of wrapping paper and gift cards. My only criticism is that I wish it were bigger! I bought a second organizer just to hold the Christmas season themed stuff. It's sturdy and I recommend it.",67,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"I buy way too much wrapping paper - I think it's all the pretty colors. So my house has been a mess of paper stacked in corners, bags stuffed in the back of a closet and boxes of bows. Thankfully, I found this product.

 The organizer is super space-efficient - you hang it in your closet and it takes about the same amount of space as a winter coat. There are compartments for paper, bows, ribbon, scissors, tape, bags and flat paper. Even completely full (as mine is), it's sturdy and holding up fine.

 However, it's not going to hold EVERYTHING. The description says ""up to 12 rolls,"" but I was only able to fit 8 large size rolls of wrapping paper. I still give it five stars, though, because who really needs more than 8 rolls of wrapping paper?

 Bottom line, this product is so much better than the plastic organizers you can buy at stores like Wal-Mart or Target. I plan to buy some for family members as gifts this Christmas.",173,2

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,Happy I purchased this product. I bought command strips to hang this on the back of my closet door. I do wish the bags on the front were a bit bigger and had zippers on the tops instead of being open in the front. Otherwise I'm satisfied since it gets the job done!,53,30
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"When I read the description of this product, I knew I needed to have it due to my love of always having gift wrap, and all things related to gift giving. This organizer hardly takes any room in my closet and keeps my gift wrap nice and tidy (as to where it was everywhere before).

The pockets are very nice and forgiving with different items. I keep my ribbon and tape in the pockets, but can keep many things other than that.

For the price, this is a great buy that I highly recommend for all the people who love to organize! Perfect for Christmas time and all year round!",110,31
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,This is the best! I have a small apartment and this really helps me save on space and keeps things off my closet floor. It's sturdy and has a lot more pockets than I realized! Awesome product!,37,32

Then the compartments shown in the middle of the organizer are just cheap plastic walls with no white finishing stitching/fabric as indicated in the picture.

It has velcro, which means it hangs horizontally and takes up way too much space instead of thinking I could slide it in as if it were clothes.

It's TINY and the pockets won't hold anything because they have these gigantic slits in them (presumably for easy access, but they don't hold ribbons and other wrapping accoutrements well because everything just falls out!). Very poor design and another cheap ""made in China"" product.",88,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I'm trying to organize my space and this item was a very big disappointment. It fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging. The organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package. The retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer. The areas for bows allow bows to fall out. The area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn. Actual use of the item is difficult; replacing items after use tore the ""assigned"" compartment even more.
I'm looking for another storage solution, this one did not work.",129,109

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I purchased this to organize scattered Christmas wrapping supplies.  Unfortunately, this looks a lot better in the picture than it does in real life.  It also doesn't work well at all.  Once you put wrapping paper in the side areas that hold wrapping paper, there is no real way to secure it tightly so that it doesn't flop around.  The hanger also can't take a lot of weight on it.  I tried two medium wrapping paper rolls on each side and some tape and bows in the middle section. It wouldn't stay up and hung kind of lopsided. Right now it is laying down and barely holding it's contents. I'm going to have to switch to a different wrapping paper organizer.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. :(",128,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Very disappointed. I bought one of these exact style of organizer over 10 years ago for $11.00. It had served me well for this long and just recently the plastic began to tear. So I felt that It would be a good value to get another one. This one that arrived...that I paid twice as much for is so cheap and flimsy that I doubt it will last two  years.  The plastic is so thin that it won't even stand up straight enough to support rolls of wrap...and this is while it is hanging, I have to tie a scarf around the whole thing to keep the rolls of wrap from hanging in all directions. The slide pockets in the back are oddly small and I cannot even fit my sheets of gift tags in them. This was a complete waste of money and I wish I had not bought it. Keeping my old one for when this one falls to pieces. Don't waste your money.",166,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Maybe I wasn't realistic purchasing this item.  For the price I didn't expect it to be attractive or super high quality, but I didn't expect it to be as cheaply constructed as it was either.  It's a very thin plastic that rips easily.  The ""pockets"" that are designed to hold bows have the opening on the front...sort of like a portable tissue pack, so you when you hang it they aren't on the top and the bows can fall out.  Plus, the weight of the wrapping paper rolls (and I only loaded in 5 it wasn't like I tried to fill it) pull the entire thing forward when it's hung so the plastic starts to tear and every time you touch it things fall out.  Great idea, poorly designed.  Don't waste your money on this one!",136,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"This is a great thing for getting wrapping paper contained, along with all the other things that go with it.  The organizer is two sided so you can store on both sides and hand it in a closet and access either side!  Such a great idea.",46,114

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"I just received it today. I was able to fit in 5 rolls of wrapping paper that I had, all my cards, tape, LOTS of bows, few rolls of ribbons I had, scissors - everything. There was space for everything. It's hanging in my closet and everything is accessible easily. Since I just got it today, I don't know about the longevity. When I first opened it, I thought the front pockets had tears in them. But actually that's the opening to access the pockets.",85,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"I used to have a tall plastic container for my gift wrapping supplies. While it was slightly better than storing all of my wrapping items in paper bags, it left me more frustrated than anything. Extra long wrapping paper didn't fit, bows got squished... You get the idea. I have just organized all of my supplies in this hanging organizer, and I am so impressed. It holds everything, even that too tall wrapping paper. The mountain of gift bags that I have acquired now have a home on the back of the organizer. I used a 3M hook to hang the organizer on the inside of the coat closet door. I plan to check out other organizing items from this company.

1.19.14 update
Looks like the reviews are quite mixed about this product. I've had mine since early 2011 and it's still working great. I think that hanging it as described in the initial review really helps decrease the wear and tear on the item. I agree with other reviewers that the materials to make this product could be improved upon (maybe something canvas?), but I'm still happy with it as is.",192,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I had the previous model. It wery well made with fabric netting, and I love it. Needed one more.
Found it is now made only in plastic.
Ordered it, Amazon sent it quickly. The thing looks and feels like a cheap thing. I would need to use a hair dryer to soften the plastic compartments into shape ( or hang it outside on a hot day).
BUT HERE IS THE REALLY BIG PROBLEM.
 IT IS MISSING THE CARDBOARD STIFFENERS THAT THIS CHEAP VERSION NEEDS TO MAKE THE PLASTIC COMPARTMENTS HAVE A USABLE SHAPE.
Yeah, assembly is required. BUT THE STIFFENERS ARE NOT IN THE PACKAGE.
So I notified Amazon I needed a replacement. The new one arrived lightning quick.
IT HAS NO STIFFENERS EITHER.
The item is useless and I have had it.
So I am just returning it for a refund. I cannot see re-ordering the item. Obviously a batch of these things was shipped without the needed pieces.
I am not a happy camper.",166,118

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,This product met all of our needs.  The storage is extensive for the size of the product and it's organized well.

I had one of those under-the-bed rubber maid things before buying this and it was awkward and clumsy and everything was always a mess inside.  I LOVE this item!!  You can take it out of the closet and lay it out on the table or bed and everything is easily accesible.  You can take it anywhere you need to or just leave it in the closet (where it takes up minimal space) and access what you need in a snap!  There are pockets for everything.  BUY IT.,97,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I bought the Jokari gift wrap organizer amid much scorn from my family for my consumer habits.  But now everyone at my house is so pleased I went ahead and made the investment.  This organizer is similar to one of those closet shoe organizers, only this one works!  It is flat, made mostly of clear plastic, and hangs off the integrated hanger to fit in your coat closet.  The front of the organizer is flat, with two long vertical pockets on either side which hold about 4 rolls of wrapping paper each.  Between these two wrapping paper pockets are three small pockets which hold  ribbons,  gift tags, cards, scissors etc.  On the back of organizer are three somewhat larger pockets, which you can use to hold gift bags and similar larger flattish items

 All of our Christmas and birthday wrapping items are stored, hanging flat, in an easily accessible closet.  The translucent plastic ensure that you can easily find what you need.  If you have a coat closet that can handle one more thin object on a hanger, and are looking to store 6 to 8 rolls of wrapping paper,and wouldn't mind some related items with them, I highly recommend this hanging organizer.",203,122

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"This product tore the moment I took it out of the box. I read all of the reviews that warned of similar ease of tearing but thought I'd simply be more ginger with it. It practically ripped to the touch. It was impossible to even unfold it, let alone put anything in it, without the plastic tearing at the folds, or the pockets or velcro tearing away from the piece itself.
It's too small for my purposes, as well, but that's subject to personal needs. I will say that the center compartments for storing bows and ribbon are too stiff to open enough to fit bows in without crushing them.
Overall, the primary and pretty much the only necessary thing to mention is that it didn't last a half second upon arrival. $20 down the drain.",136,124

The only real problems are: lack of accommodation for large (tall) rolls of ribbon, the tape compartment fits only the smallest tape dispenser (doesn't fit a normal 3M Gift Wrap tape dispenser), and the ""card"" pockets are too small.  Otherwise, the design is great and I like it much more than the Rubbermaid giftwrap bin we used previously.

Also I don't need to worry about leaving the Econo Heaters on with my kids in their rooms alone because the heaters will not get hot enough to burn them.

They do heat nicely, the only problem with them is most of them have cracked.  Sometimes they crack right away, sometimes they will crack after you turn them off in the spring.  I have sent many of them back and they do send you a replacement without a problem.  I  have even been told to use joint filler to fix the cracks.  They are like square pieces of clay, with wires running through them.  I think the contraction and expansion of them being turned on to heat and then cooling down when off,  cracks them.  I've thrown a couple of them out.  Wish they would come up with a model that does not crack.  Other then that they are great, they do heat.",138,3

I returned to the room, immediately smelling burning plastic.  I pulled away the coat to reveal a burn hole through the plastic circle, completely through to the other side.  The unit hasn't come back on since.  Be very careful about what you put near this device.",102,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,2.0,negative,The good thing about this heater is that it will heat a 10 by 10 room...eventually. This heater really needs to be on 4-6 hours before you can feel a difference in the room. If left on it will maintain the temperature to about 65 degrees. The web site says the average cost to your electric bill should be about 3 cents an hour and for me it was more about 30 cents an hour. I used the heater maybe 10 times the first month I got it. I left it on for about 10 hours each time and my next electric bill was $35 more than the previous month! Nothing else had change but this heater.,117,6

I recommend this to everyone-Try it! You will probably fall in LOVE!!!",132,13

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,"I think this heater is great for kid's rooms.  We have had this unit over a year now and use it in the winter months for our sons room which is the coldest room in the house.  We turn it on at night and by morning his room is much warmer than the rest of the house.  It does get slightly hot, not too hot to where you would immediately get burned if you were to touch it.  In my opinion this is far safer than any other heater.  It does not run our power bill up and there is no saound while it is on.  I researched many heater before purchasing this one, and I must say this turned out to be better than I expected.  I was very skeptical at first to whether this would provide enough heat, but now this is the only heater I will use in my Children's bedrooms.",154,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,"Great heaters. I've used them for years with no problem.

One thing though...

When first turned on, they outgas for the first 24 hours. They give off an odor as the material cures the same way many appliances do. If you don't want to smell it, give it a day in the garage, then move it inside.

Other than that, they are the apogee of heating technology. They come as close to the comfort of woodstove heat as electricity can and are basically invisible.",84,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,4.0,positive,"For anyone that has a marriage where you can never agree on what is a comfortable temperature, this heater will be your winter salvation. I have a hard time retaining heat and my wife has a hard time expelling it. The problem with most space heaters is that they heat the room well beyond the temperature you set the thing too. This heater will always comfortably heat a room very evenly. It gives off a comfortable, radiant heat. This is wall mountable which means it won't take up any space in the room. Summer storage is just wrapping the cord around it. My advice is to mount on the wall near the person that likes it warm. It helps to create a slightly warmer pocket that won't affect the rest of the room. I have sinusitis and this heater really helps my sinuses drain.",144,17

The other side of the heating unit was begining to turn black and smolder.  We unplugged and removed the heater immediately.  It took about 2 weeks before the burning chemical stench left our room.  I just THANK GOD that we woke up before it was too late.

Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,"I've ordered 2 of these panel heaters now. We think they are absolutly great! They are very easy to install and take up no space - they don't even look like heaters attached to the wall. We bought 2 because we were so impressed with the first one and decided that we needed one for a different room. It is true that they only heat an area of about 100 square feet, but they do that very well. What's really neat is they get comfortably warm to the touch, but don't burn, so they are safe to put in small areas - and great to lean back against for a toasty back.

While at the time of installing these heaters in our apartment we did not pay for our own electric, it only makes sense that they cost less than most other electric heaters. An old heater we had ran at 2100 watts and these take only 450. My 2 computers run at 750 watts each! It must be cheaper than a less-efficient source of heat.

All in all I think the heaters are well worth it..we would buy another and have been recommending them to all of our friends and families.",202,20

I am going to contact the consumer reports group and email the photo so they may review this item.

Overall it ""was"" alright. It takes the chill off of a room. It did not raise temperature significantly. I don't think in my case of 2 year life it was worth the money spent.

I have only used a couple of days so I'm not sure what effect they will have on my electric bill but hopefully the same or less as the space heaters we were using.  I am conserned because the walls in this room are wood shingles?  and they seem to heat up.  We are looking at other options on mounting.  I have purchased the electric temp sensor so that it will turn them off and on as needed.  They do get a little hot to the touch but for most adults I don't think it will be an issue.,133,24

They work as indicated by the company (to heat 100 sq. ft.)

You must place them on a solid wall such as drywall.

At first, we tried placing it in our older home on some paneling that had nothing behind it but the studs. The paneling is thin, and the wall got a little too hot for my comfort.

However, I found that if you place it on drywall or other solid surface, the wall doesn't get hot.

There is no noticeable difference in the electric bill.

Once it gets cold and stays cold, we leave it on 24/7.

We use ours in the laundry room which is roughly 100 sq. ft. and it works wonderfully, and we're glad to have it for that purpose, but we wouldn't purchase any for the rest of the house as they are not aesthetically pleasing, nor would they be efficient for the rest of the house.",169,25

Quite hot in the center but the outer edges were cool to touch.  I'm wondering if that's a fault  found in my heaters since the product seems to have such rave reviews.  It didn't have the heating power I expected.  I found the small Soleus radiant heater gave of a lot more heat for 400w, which was the same amount the panel heater used.

I live in Atlanta GA, which has quite mild winters so I was disappointed with the performance.  But since the panels are permanently attached to my walls I may give them another try this winter.",118,26

The website even touts this (being able to paint it to match the wall) as an advantage of the product but does not warn that the heater will not work as well afterwards.  We contacted the company several times to complain, but they would never get back to us.  Like I said, these things are okay, but the company doesn't give you all the facts, and they will not get back to you if you have problems.  I won't be buying any more.",129,27

We live in Boston and had all 4 working non-stop since December 1, 2005. The Econo-heater give off about 10% of the heat we expected.  The temperature in a test room was only 2 degrees higher.  The detail documentation that came with the heater says that you can expect 10% of the heat coming from the face of the heater.  That is all the heat you get!  The truth of this heater is in the 90 warranty, by the time you figure out it does not work, the warranty has expired.  This Econo-heater is a great idea, but get an oil filled heater for heat.  The electrity that both burn is the same, but you only get 10% of the heat with the Econo-heater.",149,31

With one each in our master bedroom (northeast corner), study, and adjoining sunroom, the results have been outstanding.  Although deep winter has yet to arrive here in Maine, our Monitor runs only a third of its normal curve...the Econo-Heaters maintaining a soft, even heat in those outer rooms.  For our application I feel it's best to avoid large swings in temperature and we choose to let them run most of the time, however one could use timers or thermostats with the units if desired.  We have yet to figure any specific heating cost reductions, but anticipate considerable savings, especially as we face increasingly high fuel costs.

I usually dismiss any type of electric heating units, but these are clearly a wonderful addition for most well-insulated applications.

I even went out and looked at the power meter when all the panels were active (4 big and 2 small panels) and the meter was barely spinning.  If I did that with the old baseboard heaters the meter would be twirling like mad.  Great product.  Already have a co-worker looking into them for his place and a friend is looking at them too.

My mother-n-law enjoyed her morning cup.  I bought the more pricier filter cups so I'm sure that plays a part in good coffee.

I wish the fry basket were larger, though I guess the rest of the appliance would have to be bigger, so I guess I wish the whole thing were just a bit bigger, but it's still a good size for the price.

I wish both the thermostat ant the timer were digital.  The timer is an egg timer type dial, and the thermostat is a slider, amking for somewhat impercise settings, though this is relatively minor.  It's still a very good deep fryer.",143,2

Contrary to other reviews, I have never had a problem with this vacuum - in fact, it consistently fills up the bag-less container every time we vacuum.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,"This vacuum blows...literally.  The exhaust fan blows in front of the vacuum at floor level so it blows everything you want to sweep ahead of you and into the air, and you'll never catch it until what is to heavy to become air borne is stopped by a wall. This is not obvious on a rug because the rug camouflages it and holds the dust better...but just try it and see on a bare floor.  Granted, you can overcome this design flaw by sweeping backward or only using the tools.  Granted, it also has good suction, but that just means a stronger airflow coming out of the exhaust.  I bought this on the recommendation of Consumer Reports, and I already wrote them a letter and told them to test it again, hopefully with someone who knows how to vacuum.

But when I moved to carpet, the suction was so strong that I could barely push or pull it.  And even though the suction was strong, it only picked stuff up on the side that had the air in-take.  When I went to empty the dirt holder (which had a lot of dog hair in it), I tipped it upside down over the trash, and nothing came out.  I had to shake it w/ all my might to get the thing to empty, and then the filter fell out in the trash, so I had to get that now-dirty thing replaced before I could finish up.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,"We bought this vacuum three months ago, and my experience has been similar to the other 1-star reviews: it's not worth the money.  It indeed blows dust on hardwood floors, and is basically ineffectual on those surfaces.  We sweep first, then vacuum the pile with one of the attachments, and this really defeats the point of having a vacuum.  Then the brush roller broke after 3 months.  Just like the other writer noted, it doesn't turn true (it sounds like its bearings are shot); we got it out before it broke the belt or destroyed other internal parts. No abuse to it otherwise, it's just a faulty part that is not covered by warranty, and is now out of stock for another month.

This is a very bad product, and horrible corporate support.  As a customer, you should be skeptical of buying ANY product from a company that doesn't stand behind their units.  This is yet another example of the evils of big-corporation America.",164,5

I have three cats and this thing picks up the fur like nothing I've ever used.

I didn't find that emptying the container and cleaning the filter was all that messy.  If you do it in a deep trash container it's no big deal.  It's a lot worse to change the bag on my canister.

We have very hairy, shedding dogs. and it's been great to just pull out this little thing and make it all go away within a few minutes. Our old canister was so expensive and bulky and didn't pick up as well. Also the rug in my bedroom is kind of strangely made and the canister didn't pick up the dog hair from there at all. This one does.

I do understand the complaint about blowing but ours has nonetheless done fine on hardwood. Love the bagless element. If it only lasts one year, it will have been well worth the price. Yes, noisy, I really couldn't care less.

No worries though, you can buy a replacement brush for about $20 + $5 S&H, which comes to $25 on a $50 vacuum cleaner. Yeah right!

The F1 filters are very difficult to find in stores, although I found one at Target selling for $40, 80% of the cost of the whole vacuum cleaner! You can get them online, most places want to charge at least $20, but Amazon has them for around $8.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"Love this! VERY sturdy and heavy duty. Was worried that the weight of the mugs wouldn't hold but this is super reliable, and it has gel grips to keep it from sliding around.

I bought 2 of these. I have small cups for one rack and the other holds my 4 larger cups. Make sure that you think about the height of your cabinets. Your cups will hang down and you may have to raise your shelf up a little. I did .",85,27
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,I wish I would have listened to the other reviews.  This looks like a great product but it won't fit all the way in the cabinet.  If you bend the top piece to make it fit then the top arm sticks up and you can't use that part of the shelf.,51,28

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,I don't know why people leave such low stars for these. They are great. You can't fit 10 normal sized coffee cups on one but you can fit 6. Works for us!,32,31

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,"Had a very hard time trying to get it on my cabinet. After I did I wanted to move it, but didn't want to go through all the trouble again so I just took it down and gave it away.",40,33
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,"Just got these in - and I agree with other reviewers that they are not good for sliding onto standard shelves at all. Measuring, toward the joint, there is only a half inch between the arch of the holders and the bracket. I got it about 4 arches in before having to give up (with the outside portion no longer lying flat in doing so). I also broke one trying to open up the bracket enough to slide the last arch on. It looks like some of the mounting posts for the screws are bent too far inward. My shelves are 3/4"" thick.

Gave up, ended up screwing them into the bottom of the shelves, which I had purposefully bought this particular product to avoid. It's nice looking and works in half its capacity, but DO NOT PURCHASE if you're hoping to slide this onto a shelf more than 1/2"" thick. Too big of a gamble that you'll get one that won't slide on.

EDIT: 2 to 1 star.
They hold about 2 - 3 coffee mugs on each side (so a total of 4 for me) depending on the depth of your shelves.",194,34

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,Trying this item because the books are too close together and they don't hold coffee cups because of that. Shipping was on time but the product definitely did not do what was described,33,36

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"This is a great idea, but it was way bigger than I thought and hung down a lot lower. If I use it, I cannot have any mugs below it - so it doesn't really save space. Also, you can't fit a mug on every hanging piece - maybe every other one - even for smaller mugs. It is a great idea though, hopefully they can update it with a few changes to make it work better.",77,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,Bought this for inside my cabinet but it just doesn't fit quite right and the weight of the mugs seems like it might be an issue over time.

And I've got these loaded up, completely full with china teacups and glass/stainless steel espresso cups.  If I were hanging big ceramic mugs on them, yeah they'd probably sag, but as it is right now they're doing a beautiful job rescuing my awkwardly sized kitchen.",74,56

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,Bought for son to use.  He likes a lot. Promptly shipped and good price value.,15,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,"I had to return the mug holder. It does not hold 10 mugs, it holds maybe 4. You have to skip a hook between mugs to get them to fit, and I'm not talking about huge mugs. I tried with regular coffee cups.",43,59

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,A little hard to install once you get to the very end of the unit...tight fit.  Once installed worked great.  Wish I would have put it in a different location so that I can have my entire cabinet but oh well.  Gave me room to put 4 mugs on the rack (couldn't hold 10 if I tried on it) and my other 4 mugs below the unit.,67,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"Fits the shelf and looks cool, but didn't really realize until I tried it that it will not fit ten full size mugs- they knock into each other as the hangers are so close together. Still fits six nicely and could fit ten smaller cups!",45,62

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,"The ad shows a picture of it being clipped to the shelf above it - this cannot be done!!! Even the detail shows a sizeable opening in the clip; but it is less than l/2"" and much too small to clip to the standard kitchen shelf!!!  If installed with screws, it will hang so low as to make the shelf below unusable, so no space saving at all.  In fact, you could stack the cups in less space than this would take up.",83,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,unfortunately I could only get 4 mugs on it so it's back in the box!  Would cost me too much to return it so it will sit here until I can perhaps find someone who can use it.,38,69

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,Will buy again.  Perfect size for shallow cabinets and shelves.,10,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,This only fits very small mugs. Normal sized mugs must be placed on every other rung and get crowded. You also can't place anything on the top shelf because that's where it slides in. Takes up more room than it creates.,41,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,Can hold 6 regular morning coffee type mugs and allows me to put a few more cups and mugs between the arms in the cabinet. This is a cute addition to my coffee area of the kitchen.,37,73

Earlier I had purchased one of the Under the Shelf 10-Hook Space Saver Espresso Cup Storage Drying Rack / Cupboard Mug Holder - MyGift, now that one fits perfectly.  Unfortunately, I bought the last one available from Amazon and the message is that they don't know when it will become available again.  That's really a shame because it is a far superior product to the one from Spectrum.  After all, what use is an under-the-shelf cup holder that sticks out so you can't shut the cabinet door?",125,89

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"Very sturdy & well-made, fit my 3/4 inch shelf perfectly without wobbling around. The only drawback is that my mugs face a different direction than I prefer.

I have standard, run of the mill cabinets in a house built in 2006. Nothing unusual. I had to pound the poop out of this thing with a hammer to get it to fit. It is definitely made for super skinny cabinet shelves.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,Construction and idea are fine; just Very poor design. Shelf must be very thin (maybe 1/4 inch) for it to slide onto shelf. I had to break off first hook just to get it to work even poorly. Disappointed to find one on same search page that doesn't have this flaw. Not worth the effort to return so it's lost bucks.

As the description indicates, there are 4 spaces for screws if you prefer to mount it to the underside of a set of cabinets. A lot of reviews noted that the hooks are spaced for small 'tea' cups, which is accurate, meaning that using the standard american style 'coffee' mug you will only be able to hang 4, maybe 6 mugs on this rack if  you are clever.

If you have American sized coffee cups or larger (12oz+), get more. A 10 oz cup is about the limit if you expect to get one on each rung. I managed to fit my 16oz cups on each rung but it looked awful (very cluttered). However, once I set it up for every other rung, it looked fantastic.

The quality is good. I have 1inch thick open shelves and this gripped them nice and tight. If you have something thicker or need to close a door over it, I would suggest a mounted system or hooks instead.

It is foam filled latex, it does ! have a solid latex bottom, and mine stands up perfect. I put it on the carpet, stood fine, then the table stood perfect. And I like the evil red eyes and teeth on it. So imo for 6 something it is worth it and will add to a Halloween display. I am happy with it",96,28
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"i got this at an amazing price so i really can't complain. it's light, but provides amazing warmth and comfort.  my only discomfort is that the feathers come out from the comforter so getting a duvet cover would be a good idea.",42,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,i was a little weary when getting this because usually the gold box items aren't too great. but i am so pleased with this purchase. the blanket is warm but not too hot and is so comfy! i love the softness of it and the brown color is very nice. i wish they still had them for sale because i would get another!,63,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"This is a very thin and light weight comforter.  Much thinner than expected, but the price was right.  Looks very nice on the bed.  It takes a few weeks for the wrinckles to come out.  Shams are standard size even with the king set.  Good buy.",46,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I was hesitant to buy these at first when I saw it in the gold box. But then I said why the heck not. My hesitation was due to the fact that I had way too many comforters. However, these were the first that I ever bought for myself. The other ones were given to me as gifts. This comforter is extremely warm and yet light at the same time. I still need an extra blanket as usual since I can get very cold but it's a lot better than my old comforter. Like some other reviews said, the pillow shams are pretty small but it's fine for smaller pillows.

A word of advice: most likely, your comforter will arrive extremely.. and I mean EXTREMELY staticy most likely due to the lack of moisture in the box. The solution I have found is to sprinkle some water on the comforter or to spray some febreze on it. Not only would it help to make it smell better but also gets rid of a bit of static electricity. So be careful when taking the comforter out and enjoy!",187,3

Sadly, however, the cats (at least one of 'em) don't!  This thing is LOADED w/static!  If you touch it in the middle of the night, you can see blue sparks! My lil furry guy was acting all weird & didn't want to jump up in bed w/us per usual.  When he finally did, he stood @ the edge of the mattress.  I unknowingly pulled him against me on the blanket.  Welp, blue sparks flew off him & he went a-runnin. So, sadly, I can't really use this blanket unless we're purposely trying to keep him outta bed (if ya know what I mean LOL). ;o)",131,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I bought this as a deal of the day special for $39. For that price, it's OK, but I would never pay full price. The pillow shams are too small, and the king size is too small for my king size matress. I can use it as an individual comforter, but then I'll have to dry clean (preferred) or launder it more frequently. The cover does not come off the feather/down insides - it's one piece. That makes it a pain in my posterior.

The cover is very soft, and the chocolate color beautiful. It is nice and warm and very comfy. It is quite lovely to look at and touch. For that, plus the cheap price, I'll give it barely 4 stars. For the undersize and launder problem, i should give it no more than 3 stars.",138,5

I could NOT find them anywhere so I bought these ones from Amazon.  I am delighted!  They are very classy in appearance, very ""suede-like.""  My kids like them a lot and they are soft and cozy for sleeping.  When I eventually wash them, I will certainly wash on delicates cycle and line dry to avoid any ""feather poking"" issues as mentioned by others.

If you like microsuede it looks great, and anyways, how often does the comforter touch your skin?  (With this one preferably never.)

I can't say I'm unhappy with the purchase, the other reviews were real clear, I went in eyes wide open.  It's a decent value and it serves it's purpose nicely, but it's not a comforter you're likely to fall in love with when you pick it up.  (Those cost way more.)",115,17

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I received this comforter about a month ago, and I love it!  It's very plush, and easy to wash while looking fantastic in my room.

I was very disappointed in both the quality, as well as the description.  This was definitely not as advertised.  I would give 0 stars, if possible.",85,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,"product is nice to look at, but that's the only good part. When you move it, it sounds like there's plastic in the inside layers. Also, little feathers are constantly poking through and falling out of it.",37,24

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"We use this thing for our guest bed and in limiting the stay of guests I suppose it does a good job. However, as a cover for a bed and while asleep it fails spectacularly.

The first thing you notice with this product is the sound. It ""crinkles"" and sounds cheap. The sound is akin to cellophane and not at all pleasant. Then you notice the big fault: it won't stay stuffed. From the time we first received it to now this comforter must have lost 50% of the feathers. They are everywhere. It makes the product look dirty when it sits on the bed and it pokes and prods all night when in use.

I would not buy this again and would indeed refuse it should someone offer it to me free of charge. Avoid at all costs unless you like a ""loose feather"" decor and the feel of amateur acupuncture.",152,26

Just about every single feather that was sewn into the comforter has managed to slip out. My bedroom, at times, looks like a chicken coop! Every time you look at the comforter, all you see is little white feathers sticking out. No matter how long you spend plucking the feathers out of the comforter, there are always more. And they hurt, too! It's not the fluffy side of the feather which sticks through, it's the needle-sharp quill that always does! Manufacturer should have done a better job ensuring that their feather product stayed inside of the comforter.",109,29

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"I ordered this item to match the color in my room. The color matched perfectly but I regret to say that this was a waste of $40. Why? well because after using the comforter for 3 nights the feathers started to come out from the comforter. There are no holes in it but the feathers themselves poke thru the fabric and eventually make their way all the way out or they hang out half way and poke you all night if you sleep in the nude like I do. Horrible product. I have no choice but to keep using it and cleaning up a few feathers here and there each morning until enough of them poke out to where it will stop...at least that is my hope, if not I will have to shell out real money to buy a quality comforter from sears or macy's and chuck this one in the trash where it belongs.",156,32

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,I have only the comforter for about 2 months.  The feathers inside are poking through the material on both sides which not only makes it uncomfortable to sleep with due to the quills coming through but makes a mess because of all the feathers on my floor.  It also becomes very unsightly.  My comforter is dark brown and the feathers being white causes it to look like there is something all over it.  The only good thing I can say is it definately keeps you warm.,86,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,Like I said horrible. Cheap microsuede material and stitching. Down feathers poke through the microsuede and poke you in your sleep.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,I ordered this comforter because I thought it would be a great comforter and very warm for this winter... but I was wrong.

I wish I had never purchased this comforter.,66,36

Since the blanket was too big to really get clean in the washer and micro suede will melt/burn in the dryer; I washed this in the bath tub and hung it to dry. It was so hard to ring most of the water out and so heavy to move to hang.

I had to move to a new apartment, and recommend my old apartment to bird lovers only. There is no way that bedroom will ever be feather-free again, there are just too many feathers everywhere.

I haven't had any problems with the feathers moving toward the center or poking out, and my husband is a big guy also. The only bad thing about it is that it is not that big. I bought a king for my queen bed and it barely reaches to the bottom of the frame. I may buy a bedskirt to go under it. Other than that it is so warm and so nice!",84,147
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"I purchased this set for my teenage son.  He specifically wanted a black comforter set which hard to find in department stores.  I came across this one and decided to give it a try. The price was really great, and this comforter set looked really high quality.  However, within one month, my son was complaining about all of the pokey feathers.  The feathers are coming out all over his comforter and he is no longer happy with it.  I guess the price was too good to be true!",88,148
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,I orginally ordered the set thinking that I wasn't going to like it.

I am going to order another comforter set for the guest bedroom!,53,149
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,Light weight.  It feels soft. It would have been helpful for me to know before I purchased it that it required dry cleaning.,23,150
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"I bought this because it was cheap, and boy is it cheap. It's thin as paper, and I think it has paper inside it by the feel of it. I'm tempted to slash it open to see what's inside because I certainly can't use this as a blanket.

The material inside is actually crinkly and noisy, which is not a benefit when you're trying to sleep. The blanket is thin, uncomfortable, noisy, not particularly warm, and I highly recommend that you avoid it.",83,151
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,Great quality and price! Nice weight of fabric. Cozy texture. Description is very accurate. I would have liked to know the length of the comforter.,25,152
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"The price was incomperable....  $30.00 for a KING sized, micro suede down comforter.  The only thing I would change is making it more fluffy.  It's comfortable, soft, very light and breathes better than you would think.  I have it on top of one of my very fluffy down comforters and another micro suede comforter, a little fluffier than this one, so this is almost like the cover of the bed.  Nonetheless, it doesn't matter to me that I have it on the top of the bed, it's nice to settle down on the bed and relax into it.  It's very soothing.",101,153

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"For the price, I thought this is a great fit for my bedroom. Not big and bulky, but still keeps us warm and looks nice. We have a queen size bed and bought the king size comforter, and it just barely covers the bed. So definitely worth it to buy the size up.",53,156
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"Very pleased with the quality of this product. I would never have been able to find a microsuede down/feather ""King"" comforter (or any size for that matter) at this terrific price.",31,157

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,"It's got a plastic liner which makes crinkly sounds when it moves. And yes, it sheds. And it doesn't really feel as good as you'd expect a microfiber to feel. I went out and bought a different one, paid twice as much, but I'm a lot happier with it.",49,161
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,The feathers in the blanket are always coming out all over. and at night you cant cuddle up in the blanket because the feathers are always stabbing you.,28,162
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,I really liked this when it arrived. Very soft and warm and the color was perfect. But after about 4 months the stitching started coming out. I don't lay on it and I have never washed it so I guess you get what you pay for.,46,163
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,"I didn't expect anything amazing.  The King Size is the same size as a queen set I ordered at the same time (from a different manufacturer.)  This set was thin, barely as thick as a quilt.  It makes a crackly noise, too.

The color is what I consider a true brick color: deep red.  The color was exactly what I wanted, so the shams are very useful.  The comforter itself, not so much.  I have it folded across the foot of my bed for color rather than function.",88,164
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"It's not as ""thick"" as I prefer my comforters to be and it is 'noisy'.  Meaning, whenever you turn you can hear the cover rustling around.  Not good for very light sleepers.",32,165
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,this was such a great deal and so comfortable !!!!!!  not to heavy just right. keeps me and hubby warm and looks great on our bed.. the matching pillow cases are a bonus.  thanks so much,36,166
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,"It is very pretty, but needs more bulk.  Also we see quite a few feathers come out from the comforter.  But the price was cheap.  You get what you pay for.  It's okay for spring or early fall, but don't expect heavy duty warmth from it.",46,167
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I have a Ralph Lauren down comforter that I've had for a while but needed something a little lighter for the summer - this comforter was perfect. As a precaution, it is pretty thin. This is not a winter comforter, but it does keep you warm. The materials are semi high-quality. You get what you pay for.

My only problem with the comforter is that the feathers tend to come out through the material on occasion but that is expected with a down comforter for the most part.

Overall, I was happy with the gold box price I paid for this set and would reccommend it as a good comforter under $100",112,168
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,There are two reasons I didn't give this product 5/5...it sheds feathers like CRAZY and is dry clean only.  Otherwise a nice comfortable lightweight feather comforter.,26,169
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,I tried to get every one I knew who was redecorating to snatch up this comforter. Only a few of my friends took advantage of the sale + free shipping and we are all very much satisfied. At first I thought the package was kind of light for a comforter but once this puppy got some fluffing it worked out to be very nice.,64,170
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"When I first unpacked it, I thought it looked like a very nice comforter, especially considering what I paid for it. I  soon realized that looks aren't everything. A day hasn't gone by where I haven't had to dispose 8 or more feathers. At this rate, it is going to be nothing more than an empty shell. Even at $35, I feel I paid too much for this. I would avoid buying this unless you are needing some feathers for a Donald Duck costume you are working on, but this would even fail at that as there are about half a dozen different kinds/colors of feathers inside thing. Only 15% of its' content is actual down.",116,171
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"This is not a fluffy down comforter, it more like a down bedspread.  I purchased the king for a queen size as I want that look.  It does have a nice feel to it however, you do get a few feathers which are noticable on the black colored microsuede.  I love the feel of the microsuede and will also get some sheets in it.  People have commented that it does look very nice I paired it will so high quality white sheets and some black satin pillow shams, yet to use the pillows sham that came with it as I did get King size pillow shams with my set.",109,172
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"I purchased this on a Friday special sale price and received it for only 29.99!! It is very lightweight and comfortable, and the pillow shams were king size, not standard as in the other reviews. I have a queen size bed and ordered the king size, glad I did, because it just covers the top nicely and has very little on the sides. I am diabetic with neuropathy in both legs and feet, this lightweight comforter is replacing another that was too heavy on my feet at night. I reside in Florida where you don't need a heavy comforter, but because I also have the microsuede throw that I ordered last winter, I can attest to the fact that they are also very warm and comfortable, while remaining lightweight! There was no bedskirt included in my package, which was also fine with me, because my bed is adjustable, the bedskirts don't work well anyway. Definitely a 5 star product for the money, the microsuede is very soft also.",168,173
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"It's soft, warm and all you can say, but I have feathers all over my room... the cover is not strong enough to keep them inside... it's a shame because the price is good and the microsuede is soft...",39,174
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"I was so happy about the quality of the comforter. I was nervous that the color would be gray, but it wasn't. It's definately black and when I first opened it, it didn't look like it would be too thick, but it just needed time to air out. It seems thin, but it is extremely warm and the under part is almost like a vinyl, so it keeps you cool also. Overall, very satisfied. I recommend this.",77,175
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"This was in the Gold Box, and the customer reviews were very positive so I bought the queen/full set for my guest bedroom.  I'm very pleased!  It's light weight, looks nice, it's warm, etc.  I found the range of color choices kind of icky, but the ""Camel"" is sufficiently bland to blend with any decor.  Additionally, it should withstand getting dirty easily.  It weighs nothing, and it does not smell at all!  Apparently people have had odiferous adventures by machine washing it??  There is a rather prominent tag on it saying ""Dry Clean Only.""  LOL.",95,176
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter. It appears to be a little on the thin side, but is very warm.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"I got this on a Gold Box sale and I love the price; also love the feel of it and the best thing is that I love the color red and this is one of my favorites.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,"This is a nice looking comforter, however, it lacks in the filling. The comforter is thin in most areas so it is not as warm as it could have been. To bad they skimped on the filling.",37,179

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I paid $34.99 for this Microsuede Down Comforter Set.  I was thinking I was getting a sheet, comforter, and pillow cases because of the ""set"" but this set does not include the sheet.  I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks and it works well.  I tend to get a little hot with this comforter but my girl friend loves it!  It's really comfortable, soft, and has no weird odor coming from it.  Additionally, you can machine wash this comforter but it is recommended that you dry clean it.  One really annoying thing about this comforter is how the down stuffing all ends up at the bottom or sides of the comforter.  You contently have to shake the comforter to get a nice distribution of the stuffing throughout. The reason this happens is because the squares/pattern on the comforter doesn't completely enclose the down stuffing.  So the sides of the squares are open allowing the stuffing to move to the sides and end of the comforter.",166,182

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I would only change one thing about this... they should use a different material for the inside cover, I feel like I'm sleeping in a barn with a lot of chickens, the feathers are everywhere and sometimes they poke when I'm sleeping... if the feathers were to stay inside I would totally recommend it. BTW it is really warm and cozy",61,186
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"It was much thinner than I was expecting, and I didn't think it would keep me very warm. But once I started using it, I realized it is very warm and am very pleased with it.",36,187

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"While the comforter wasn't as heavy as I'd thought, it certainly is a steal for the price and is sufficiently warm.  When I ordered there was some question as to washability.  It is machine washable, although I haven't needed to launder mine yet.  The olive color is very similar to the picture...it is a rich, deep olive green.  I am thrilled with this set.",64,190
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,"I've bought the cheaper set of barstools with a single metallic looking column.  They're one of the first hits that show up if you search amazon for bar stools.  Pack of two was about 80 and they were very modern looking.

Unfortunately, build quality on both was poor - both broke under gentle use and I am 155 lbs, well below the weight rating.

Very pleased with my first purchase of this stool.

Cushion is quite good after one month of use.  Cushion is deep enough for you to feel a slight sinking sensation.  I have no problem practicing guitar on the stool.

Four legs are very good for stability.  I have mine under an island sitting on Mid level apartment carpeting.  I don't detect any damage to the floor, or any slipping of the stool when getting on or off.

I agree with the other reviewer that buying furniture, especially something like a chair which holds your body weight can be bit of a gamble.  Even so, I like this particular stool enough to buy another one.

Looks modern and subdued.  It matches pretty well with dark brown furniture from Target if you like shopping for modern looking furniture without designer mark ups!",204,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,"I bought one of these in 2009 for small prep shelf, really comfortable and looks great.  We just replaced our dining room outfit with a counter height, same style so I bought 2 more of these stools for additional seating.  Very sturdy.",42,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,It was difficult to find a single stool (most stools are packaged in pairs).  I always find the best deals and great sellers on Amazon.  This stool took 5 minutes to put together and is very well made.,38,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,"These stools are nice looking, easy to assemble, and reasonably comfortable.  The cushions are a little softer than I would like, so if you sit for a long time your rear gets a little sore.  But they look great and have a nice finish.  They are a lot lighter than I expected, so whatever wood is used is not very dense.

One of the stools had a small hairline fracture in the finish, but nothing major.

They assemble with good quality screws that are nice and long, so I expect these to hold up nicely over time.

EDIT:  As someone ""liked"" my review, here is a two-year update:

These stools are still fine.  I assembled them with a small amount of wood glue on each screw, which probably helped.  The little screw hole ""caps"" popped out after a few weeks, but putting wood glue on them solved that problem.  These stools are used only occasionally, but are still doing great and look brand new.  The cushions are as good as new.  We are still very happy with these.",178,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,"I got 3 of these for our counter.  We have had it for about 2 months now. For the price, it isn't bad.  We have used it enough, that we know it's not really meant for heavier people ( over 225 lbs ).  It is easy to assemble, but one of the stools had one leg piece that just wouldn't flush agaisnt another piece and we ended up stripping the screw that was supposed to tighten it together so we have a gap that's slightly noticeable.  They are very lightweight and the seat is very ""cushy"", not firm.  You tend to sink into it a little.  It's made of pleather or whatever it is, so it can stick to your skin.  Otherwise, not bad for the price considering how pricey good bar stools can be.  It does look really great in my espresso colored kitchen.  I do still wish I had spent the extra to get a more solid product. Oh well, I hope these last at least 3 years and I'll be happy with that.",176,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,"We picked four of these up on a gamble.  We couldn't find anything local that was comfortable AND sturdy.  It was always a choice of either comfortable OR sturdy.  These are great looking and really match the bar I put in our basement.  This may be a stretch, but they even make the football games more exciting and the beer smoother and colder.  What a deal.  I highly recommend these chairs.",71,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,I purchased 2 of these stools... but they quickly loosened up.  I tried to tighten them back up but they don't stay tight.  They are actually dangerous to sit on at this point.  I am VERY disappointed in these stools.,40,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,1.0,negative,"Comes unassembled. It took two of us an hour to assemble two stools. I used two days before one of the stools started swaying back and forth when I sat down. I tightened it again and it still does it. I'm an average size woman and the cushion goes down after you sit on it, and eventually returns to it's normal size. I'm donating these two stools and ordering new ones from another company. You get what you pay for!",80,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,2.0,negative,"Not bad construction but the padding was non existent. It looks great but the padding is so soft it sinks flat. I'm 175lbs and my wife is way smaller and it does it to her.

Buy the hooks that have two insertions on the hook itself. They are a little harder to attach to the pegboard,  but are firm and stay in place with no movement or wobble. I found that by ""stretching"" the bottom peg board hole makes it much easier to insert.
 Just insert one of the hook retainers in the bottom hole  and wiggle it a bit too enlarge the hole some.",106,30

Anyway, Crawford, newsflash:  crappy plastic hooks break when you insert them into a peg board.  I just told Amazon that they're embarrassing themselves by stocking and selling something so obviously shoddy. Well made pegboard trays and jars would have hooks made from something sturdy.  A metal band around the jar and a metal hook might work.  I'm pretty sure I've heard some good things about metal hooks, but I'm not an expert.",127,36

The plastic legs are too soft and bend horribly while trying to insert it into the peg board. As a result, I can only use one of them (the other simply refuses to mount on the peg board).

The product description states it will work for both 1/8"" and 1/4"" pegboards, and while the accessories will fit in the holes of 1/4"" pegboard, they are ridiculously loose (to be expected) and the biggest surprise is that the plastic locks they include to keep the accessories in place don't work at all in pegboards with 1/4"" holes.  All in all, the product's price was low enough to make the cost of returning it a moot point but the bins and jars, while flimsy, are usable.  If my pegboard was drilled with 1/8"" holes, I'm sure I'd be completely satisfied with this product.",120,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,"The pegs themselves are decent quality, but they DO NOT fit 1/4"" boards. When you put them into a 1/4"" board they don't sit flat against the board and so you can't put those plastic clips on to secure them. They also don't come with the 2nd peg (not sure what you call them) that keeps it stable. As stated by a few others too, the plastic bin and jar pegs are very flimsy, I was very apprehensive even putting them on afraid they would break.

On the other hand, the longer tool brackets and multi-tool hangers were pretty decent. The entire set is still far less than just the few parts I liked bought individually, so I gave it 2 stars. But don't buy this expecting to use the L or U shaped hangers.",135,61

We particularily liked the small clips that hold the hooks and holder to the board so they don't move, we have never seen those here, we can buy a few hooks sold separately now and then. We recommend this set to anyone that is starting out because the quality and variety is all in one box.",118,62

Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,"I bought a set of hooks only from this company last year.  It's really, really bad.  I'll never get anything from Crawford again.  I don't care that the hooks are made of thin wire and don't hold much weight, that's plenty fine for most tools.  It's that the hooks refuse to stay on the board.  The little plastic retainers that are supposed to hold the metal hooks in place don't.  They are difficult to get in place, use up holes that could have been for other hooks, fall out of the holes after a few uses, and get stiff and break in half with age.  Overall, the whole package is a waste of money.  Every time I try to remove a tool from the board, the hook comes with it and falls on the floor.  I was putting them back up, now I just throw them in the trash.  Give it a pass and get pegboard hooks that have a second metal stud on the back to hold them in place.",171,64

Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,"There seems to be a lot of user error and confusion regarding this bin so let me hopefully help some people out:
These bins are made to work with two sizes of pegboards so that means you need to break off the lower pegs that correspond to your size pegboard. If you have the smaller 1/8"" pegboard you have to break off the middle peg, if you have 1/4"" pegboard you have to break off the two outside pegs. This bin WILL NOT work if you leave all three lower pegs in place.

This is a must have for simple organization on your pegboard. They mount up solid with no play so you don't have to worry about them falling off the wall as you are using them. The bin can be taken out and moved around if you need to but this leads to my only grip; the bins are quite loose which is necessary in order to be able to take the bins out but to me it feels like they are a little too loose.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,These bins have 3 upper hooks and 3 lower notched pegs that should align with corresponding peg board holes when you hang them. None of the lower pegs align after you hook in the uppers.  I ordered 8 of these and none align and because they don`t it holds the bottoms away from the peg board which creates an upward angle when they are secured. In addition 1 had all of its upper hooks broken off. My guess is that someone received it in a previous order and tried to force alignment and broke them off. I believe I am going to take some side cutters and snip the lower pegs off to get a flush mount. Without the lower pegs securing the bins they pull away at their bottoms when you pull items out of the bins but I will put up with that. I am contacting the seller to see if they will ship me another bin to replace the broken one. I wouldn`t buy again.,168,11

the metal is very very thin and bends incredibly easy. Its not easy to adjust once inserted and I was told the edges are very uncomfortable once in. looks like they poke into the area around the point of insertion. Nothing nicer then a jagged bit of metal in a sensative body area

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,"The quality of these pins appears good, and the pitch is right to fit the standard 0.1"" perf boards.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,2.0,negative,"Pins are too thin to work properly with most female header receivers and breadboards.  They do connect but they fall out easily.  Plus the pin has a thick base which shortens the pin on one side.  From what I can tell these would work great if you're soldering them to a PCB and planning on using them to solder that component to something else.  Also, like someone else said, the plastic holding them together often breaks in the wrong spot leaving the end pin exposed (or it falls out).",89,1

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005HN237S,4.0,positive,"These are nice pins, and fit the listed pitch perfectly. My only complaint is that the plastic strip, which you must cut to size for whatever header you are attaching to, tends to break along the side of the pin - not between the pins where you would want it to.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,"I ordered three of these lids for the slim jim cans that we have in the office.  We typically use Glad 30-gallon trash bags in the cans.  They are nice because the footprint isn't wide in two directions, so it fits nicely against a wall or the end of a counter without being in the way.  The lids are a nice touch because they stay shut after trash items have been dropped inside.  I realize that the lids are a bit costly (about the same price of the trash can itself), but I think we need it in our office environment because they look much better than just having an open trash can.  I have it four stars because of the price is higher than I would have preferred ($31.84).",130,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,"I ordered a replacement lid 14 1/2 X 14 1/2.  I received the ""Slim Jim"" instead.  The company took no responsibility for sending the wrong item and I had to pay return shipping.  Very unsatisfied. I will never deal with this site again.",43,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,"Not worth the full street price, IMO, but I'd still keep mine.

The plastic is surprisingly thin and light, and mine did come with the jagged flashing as another reviewer photographed. The rods were shipped loose, as was expected and as I suspect they are supposed to be shipped.

Installation tip: DO NOT attempt to take the doors out of the frame to install the rods. Instead, push the rods between the door and the frame, then loop around from behind to pop the rods into the doors. Another reviewer's trick of using a sturdy hook or S-shaped tool works great. I just used my fingers.

As for the doors catching on the plastic liner, that is solved by buying the correct sized liner such that it is stretched taut over the mouth of the trash can. Buying too large a liner inevitably results in ballooning or bunching of the bag, which invites the door catches getting caught on the excess plastic.",162,4

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,"This lid will not stay closed. Once I put trash into the garbage can, the lid swings open and then hangs there. I have to manually grab the flap so it will swing closed, or I have to try and jostle the can a bit so the lid will swing closed.

Most of the lids did not and the metal bars fall out constantly.  I own a childcare center and purchased these for the classrooms to use for food disposal.  But the doors are suppose to close.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,"We use this in combination with the carbonator cap.  It works, but it only last 6mos. before it develops leaks and must be replaced.  We're looking for another brand that will hopefully last longer.",34,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,Used in my custom built home carbonation system.  I didn't want to pony up the cash to keep refilling SodaStream tanks so I built a system myself and this little gem along with the carbonator adapter (also available on Amazon) made it all come together.,45,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,"I made my own beverage carbonator, like the soda stream. Search around you can find tutorials. This was a key component.",21,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,"maybe it's the hose clamp hose combo I have, but something, I think this, leaks.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,5.0,positive,Plugged this into my home made carbonation system and it works like a champ. Just make sure that the hose you have is the right size as this lock.,29,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,2.0,negative,"This product worked for me just a few times before the spring assembly broke on me and all the ball bearings shot out everywhere.  I managed to get the bearings back in but couldn't get the spring fixed.  Every time I did use it, there were leaks.  I wouldn't recommend this product.",52,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005SM5X66,1.0,negative,This piece is very hit or miss. About 50% of the time it works as expected. Otherwise it doesn't seal when not connected which leads to escaping gas.,28,14
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,I bought this product to use on my Bissell ProHeat 2X Professional I purchased at a big box store. This was exactly what I wanted because I can use my Bissell to clean the entire house and not just my carpet. This really can make your investment in a floor cleaner even more useful. I have a 550 square foot apartment and this tool has made cleaning the kitchen and bathroom a dream. I used vinegar instead of cleaning solution and this mopped the floors better than any traditional mop and bucket. Also the floors were dry after I was done cleaning so my dogs would not track water paw prints through my apartment.,114,0
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,It did what it was supposed to do.,8,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,"For the newer models it just clips on, no screwdrivers needed. The problem is that it lifts up off tile, and brushes make no contact. So basically you end up with a squeegee with a really weak vacuum attached.",39,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,"Product came as described and my wife was quickly able to affix this our bissell.  Work  fairly good, but our floors need some work.",24,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,"While this will work for many, its not what I wanted, it raises the machine up so the brushes don't touch the floor, acts more like a squeege with a vacuum attached",32,4
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,5.0,positive,"This is the second time I have order the Floor tool.  They do wear out (the foam), but by using this tool attached to my bissell steam machine, my ceramic tile floors are CLEAN.  So much better than getting on your hands and knees",44,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,"Well, the title of this review pretty much sums up how I feel. This item works as described, which is a real blessing considering how many hard floors we have in our house. For the quality, the price is good, which is another big plus. The major downside is that this came with no real packaging, and absolutely no instructions at all. The item was just sealed in plastic, with literally nothing else (instructions, packing slip, etc.). If you do get this item (which I would say is a good move, assuming you have hard floors and a Bissell floor cleanr), be prepared to search for directions on the internet. Granted, that's simple to do, but I'm docking a star because of poor packaging and complete lack of materials.",129,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,"Old fashioned mop will do a better job. This isn't exactly a bad product, for some reason I thought that it would be as good as mopping.",27,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,1.0,negative,"Did not buy the product through Amazon, went through Bissell direct since I wasn't sure of the part number.  This attachment does not work well, the squeegee portion is much too flimsy to effectively remove the cleaning solution, even after multiple passes, and the design does not provide adequate suction.
BTW, wish I would have bought it through Amazon as I would be returning it now.  Bissell wants return shipping, so the cost outweighs the refund.",76,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,Lifts the brushes completely off the floor so there is NO scrubbing. Just a rinse and squeegee action.,18,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,1.0,negative,"Did not fit the machine I have, though the description said it would fit.",14,10
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,These things make cleaning our brick floor much easier but the seams in the brick destroy the foam in the tool head so we need a few every time the floor gets a major cleaning (about once a year). I have noticed the same effect cleaning tile floors from the grout lines. Overall I still like these very much and will continue using as long as I can get them.,70,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,"This bare floor tool works very well.  The proheat cleaner puts the water/cleaner on the floor and the squegee tool does an excellent job of getting the water back up.  I am sure it is working well since the water is dirty.

I used this on a tile/grout surface without any problems.  You can still adjust the amount of water and cleaner just like the carpet settings.

My only issue is with high traffic areas still not perfectly clean.  This is probably more to do with the Bissel cleaner than the attachment.
I would recommend this attachment to clean hard surfaces.",101,12

Note: doesn't come with the holder stem to hold the indicator but does have a dovetail",23,1
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,The Turlen Test Dial Indicator Holder Quill Clamp is what I expected in its quality & its price. My order arrived on time and in good condition.,27,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,Cheap knockoff. All the adjusters had flat washers on them instead of wave washers so every time you would slightly move it would fall down,25,3

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,"it works well on j head bridgeport, it's to bad the dial indicator i bought with was defective on delivery (same company)",22,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,4.0,positive,"I had to remove one of the plastic washers in order to use the dovetail portion of this holder. After that it worked perfectly. I've had a name brand holder before, and while I can tell the quality between them (making small ""bump"" adjustments to your indicator are not as easy with this holder for example) the cost difference made it worthwhile.",62,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,5.0,positive,Fantastic holder. Used it all day today and it works perfectly.,11,7
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,Not a good product sometimes u can get away with being cheap not here. I ended up paying $65 for a indicol and it was well worth it. This one u pretty much need a vise grips to tighten. The indicol can easily by hand. It seems to be the slringy washers that make the difference,56,8
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,5.0,positive,well worth the the price--does what the more expensive ones do!,11,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,Its useless as shipped. The friction is to low and it does not clamp well. Look at it as a parts kit. You have to modify it to make it usable,31,10

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,"This can be used. It is only good for +/- .001"" kind of work. Gets the job done sometimes. Higher quality indicator holders get the job done everytime. Period.",29,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,1.0,negative,"This thing has bushings that are so slick that that no matter how tight you make the thumb screws the arms still move around freely. Instead of wasting your money trying to save a buck, but the real one, not this knock off.",43,13
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00ANRAC3A,2.0,negative,"Low price..,.what do you expect.  It's awkward but it works.  One good thing is it folds flat unlike some others.",20,14

When not using my helmet, this thing wears just like a hat. Spin it around and it covers the back of my neck very well. What I couldn't see was how fully it covers my head, and acts as a buffer between my head and helmet band, and actually keeps the helmet from slipping on my head, as it tends to do without the hat. My head is not huge, 22 3/16"" around, which is a MED in practically every motorcycle helmet manufacturer's size chart.",103,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00GYRZF2G,2.0,negative,Had to return these. The sizing wasn't as expected. The brim was stiff. Uncomfortable for welding,16,13

The instructions say to clean the electrode with distilled water.  No problem! I always have several gallons of those all the time.  Then it says to ""sucks it with filter paper""? Coffee filter paper?  That can't be.  I'll use a cotton swab instead.  I turn it on. Wow! The back lit display is green - pretty!  I had one exactly like it in yellow.  The ridges, the placement of sensors,  dimensions, it's the same stuff with a different name.  Now, here's the big difference: my old stuff worked for 3 months before it began to flash random numbers.  This one,  right from the plastic container it came in just flashed random numbers.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,"I received this item at no charge in exchange for an honest review.

I have a more expensive PH Meter which has a few more features, but for basic checking where accuracy (although this is still accurate) isn't as huge of a deal, this is a no brainer.  The biggest difference here is that when you calibrate it, you are responsible for turning a screw (screwdriver is included) to reset the ph level, others automatically calibrate this.  The cap also does not have an easy way to store sterilized water in it, which can help keep it calibrated.  The good news is that it has a decent plastic case, which holds the meter and the screwdriver.

It's an incredibly low price in my opinion, and having to manually calibrate isn't a huge deal, this is a no brainer.",138,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,"Works well under open air conditions.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,"This pH meter is easy to read and comes with a nice case for storage. It comes with a screwdriver to use for calibration and a sheet with instructions. I tried it with distilled water and tap water and found that it does not give a precise reading - it sort of fluctuates a bit around the correct pH of the fluid. Thus, it can give an approximate reading but is not precise enough for scientific work. This is fine for home users and a useful item for this price range. I was provided a free sample of this item for my honest review.",104,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,"For any accurate, consistent readings, this item is next to worthless. If you are measuring something where the reading does not need to be completely accurate, this will do just fine. However if you are getting this for hydroponic or water testing use I would recommend investing more money in to something more accurate. I am using this for water testing and need to re calibrate every single time I use it, which ends up costing me calibration-liquid cost...so in the end I am no better buying this cheap tool. For me it's barely tolerable.",95,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,"This device turned out to be perfect for my purpose.  I distill my own water.  I like to raise the pH to give the water some character.  With this meter I was able, through trial and error, to come up with the exact amount of solution to add to my water to bring pH to the desired level.  I can't imagine how many pH drop bottles I might have gone through had I gone that route.  It is a little slow to get to the final level but you can speed that up considerably just swishing it around a little.  One bonus shocker was I didn't know how high my city water pH was until I tested it.  Oh and the calibration was easy with the two packets supplied.",129,13

The lock is very strong on these and the inserts have not dulled or pitted. These are probably better for people who wear a size 7.5 surgical glove or higher, as they're a tad long. Some people may not like the suture scissors incorporated right behind the inserts, but i think they're fantastic.""

They are very uncomfortable to hold and use - I've never had my fingers hurt from a needle driver before.  The alignment of the jaws is off, and closure is - for want of a better term - lame.  I now get to delay my project while I look for something I can actually use.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00YW94HA4,4.0,positive,"I was really excited to try this out because I'm sick and tired of swapping between different colors. Putting this together you can definitely tell that it's a bit cheap, but I have no doubt that it's plenty strong for holding filament. My biggest complaint is that you can't easily swap between filament rolls. I wouldn't use this if you're running through pounds of filament every week (which I am), but it is useful for the colors that you only use occasionally. The big advantage that this has over the plastic spool holders that come with printers is that the metal has a lower coefficient of friction with the plastic spools, so the resistance is lower as it comes off the roll. Theoretically this would reduce your likelihood of failed prints, but I'm not entirely sure to what extent. I can say that I've been using it for a week and it appears to be working better than my standard plastic holder.

Summary: For those machines that aren't able to hold standard filament rolls (e.g. davinci and flashforge dreamer) this would be fantastic, but for makerbots and other printers that you can easily swap spools I wouldn't suggest it.",199,1

Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,2.0,negative,"Printed fine at 225 per the manufacturer's recommendation, but it has zero metallic look, just a dull brown.

I've used many other filaments with much more metallic effect, so I have a point of reference.",57,25
Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,4.0,positive,Very good material. It absorbs moisture more quickly than other brands I've tried so definitely store with desicant. I've gotten into the habit of using airtight containers to store all my filaments as I live in a very moist environment.,40,26

Industrial_and_Scientific,B019CZHWW2,1.0,negative,"This filaments very frangible and breaks easy. The ""coil"" length I purchased either wasn't a single continuous length or was so fragile it broke into several pieces of various lengths in shipping. The filament breaks so easily it isn't practical to print with since it can't bend well enough to make it to the extruder from the take up spool and has a tendency to break during printing. Was never able to get anything to successfully print because of this but the failed / aborted printed pieces were also very fragile and broke into pieces trying to remove from the print bed. I wouldn't waste any money on this filament, despite the fact that it looks great on the spool, just like a copper penny, unfortunately more fragile than dried mud.",131,28

The products are easy to use, the creams are thick and easy to apply. The containers are small but as described on the package. I definitely feel that my skin is softer, smoother, and tighter.

This stuff will not work if you do not workout in addition to using it! It is not a magic potion. I read a lot of reviews that it did not work... try doing some dead lifts and squats or eat better in ADDITION to using the product line.

I would recommend this to anyone.",103,2

Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,I don't know if this works. I think This is a good start to see which of the items you want after you run out. If you do the whole thing every day you will run out before too long BUT- I like th tingly feel of the daytime cream. I like the soft scent of the nighttime cream. When I ran out of the daytime I just used regular lotion  didn't have caffiene  but I  like to think this works. The motion of rough massage seems to be real likely more benefitial than than just magic cream. I think I will re buy the day cream.,107,6

Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,I normally do not write reviews but had to do with this .  It's deathly not a crazy miracle potion that you put on and Bam cellulites gone  but I could definitely see a difference .  It's one of those  Products that you will have to keep on buying to achieve  The results you want.  I've been using for about three weeks and there's definitely a change in my thighs.  I will continue to use this product and hope to see a bigger difference as I continue.  My only complaint  and the reason why I gave it four stars instead of five I only wish that the scrub was a bigger.  I used it up within a week.  Other than that the product is great gives a slight tingle and smells awesome.  Would definitely recommend.,135,9

I have been using it for about 2 weeks now (have bought the larger sizes to continue). This sample size will not last very long, possibly a week. I have made changes to my diet and have been working out daily while using this product so any results I am attributing to that. I still have cellulite, there has not been really any change to that. I should have listened to my inner voice that told me to save my money and just get results the good old fashion way of good nutrition and daily workouts. Did provide a tingling sensation when used, but other that that its a worthless product.",132,10

I've had this for about 6 months and the rubber is discolored to a gross looking yellow and there's mold in between the cracks where water gets in and stays trapped. I noticed a small difference in my thighs but nothing dramatic. Would most like not buy again.,69,12

The stimulating massage is temporary results that only last a few hours, but it still works. Wish they gave you larger amounts of the firming cream and the shower scrub.",47,15
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,"I have been using this product for almost 2 months now and only see a slight difference. This pack only lasted me 2 weeks but that is with me applying it on my thighs, butt, arms, and abs. The results were not great enough to persuade me to pay $90 each month for new lotions. I will stick will Nivea. At least I saw dramatic results after 2 weeks of using their product.",73,16

Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,1.0,negative,When I opened the white bottle day Creme I can't believe my eye. 1/3 of the Creme was gone. It's shrinked! Maybe the sealing hadn't been placed at the right place because it came off with the lid when I opened it. Disappointed.,43,25
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,5.0,positive,I have been using this for a few days now and I am thrilled with my results. It really firms out everything and makes you look so slim. I would defiantly recommend this. Just remember to work out and eat healthy,41,26
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,"These are really nice products and I love the scrub.  Really does smooth the skin and the night cream is great.  Thick to go on, but not so heavy that you feel smothered before you go to bed.  It's also greaseless so you won't leave any residue on the sheets either.",51,27
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,"I have been using this product for several weeks along with an exercise routine.  I have noticed a difference in my tummy area.  I have had two kids and have stretch marks and loose skin in that area.  I found it did tighten up my problem areas.

It is however, not a miracle in a bottle.",80,28
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,"I just ordered this product 2 weeks ago because the price wasn't too bad and I had to try something to get rid of my inner thigh issue before I went on Vacation at the end of March. Truthfully I can already see a difference, and I am happily surprised with the product due to the mixed reviews so I had no idea what I was going to get. Yes the creams are small but if you have a small problem area then it works great! I put the FatGirlSlim on twice a day as recommended and FatGirlSleep on before I went to bed and I used the scrubber to put on both lotions because I feel like it got it in there more and I have a feeling that's what made it work for me. I was expecting the products to have a bad/powerful smell due to other reviews and it really isn't that bad, it just smells like a scented lotion. Overall I am happy with this product and would suggest buying it for a smallish problem area because it isn't that expensive and you never know what would happen!",192,29

Before I bought what looked like a tub of cream, I had been using just the white packaging cream with QuSome... I was getting massages 4 times a week all over my body with that cream. I saw results the first week. Dimished dimples in my legs and buttocks, reduced my lumps on my back and smoothed my skin overall. I feel the need to say I am overweight after having a baby which is now 14 months old, and when I was getting the massages I was not working out two months ago. I will start using the treatment kit and workout so I will come back to review on the whole routine. However I know that Bliss QuSome product does work so I bought the treatment kit with faith that all of their other products will also work.",168,34

Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,"This product actually worked for me, and I really liked the rubber buff tool for the shower.
I used all products, but the buff remains useful in the shower with any soap product. The
Fat Girl Skin Creme did help to condition dry or puckered skin appearance ( cellulite), but
I had no expectations that this would rid my body of that. Anticipate improvement, especially
if used together at regular bathing intervals.",72,37
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,"I thought I would try this kit before buying full size products. The day and night creams are both wonderful and have shown positive results. However, the scrub has a terrible scent. It's also good but the scent of it will prevent me from buying again. Overall, worth the money and my thighs look much better than before. I am so pleased with this product that I have purchased others in the fatgirlslim line to try.",76,38
Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,4.0,positive,I bought this mainly for the massager which I love. The body scrub is very nice. I've not noticed any results with the creams though.

Luxury_Beauty,B004USKDKA,2.0,negative,I liked being able to get this an a sort of trial run pack with all of the components; doubly so after the fact because it didn't work for me and I did in fact follow the instructions. I do still like to use the shower massager from time to time though.,52,40

Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,"I bought this product to see if it would get rid of dark spots/over-pigmentation left behind by acne. After about a month of use, I found that it only made the spots a little lighter, but overall didn't really help reduce their visibility (nor did it prevent the formation of new dark spots as I got more acne). Given though, these marks were very old scars.
After using a second tube of ProEven I found I had much better results, however. The spots were not entirely gone but were much more faded (as the product advertises)and less noticeable.
My overall conclusion is that it will perhaps take more than one tube of the stuff, over a period of nearly 3 months, in order to really be effective for some people. This is pretty good considering that, by themselves, the spots would probably either never go away or take years to disappear.",151,2
Luxury_Beauty,B0050BURFC,4.0,positive,"As I have mentioned in my other reviews, I really really like this product for giving my skin an instant radiant shiny look. And it does whiten my skin to a great extend and evens my skin tone while at it. It also smells great and feels great on my skin, like I'm putting on natural milk on my face. But after more than a month it didn't really do anything for my spots, neither my reddish acne spots or my brown-ish sun spots. I started using a Filipino product that's a combination of black soap and whitening cream along with using Vichy and it seems to work better. Although the Filipino product is very harsh on my skin, I believe in ""no pain, no gain."" Especially since I have very stubborn red and brown spots due to the fact that I have dry and sensitive skin.

I probably will not buy this product again unless I came across a good deal, but overall I'm satisfied with its whitening and radiance features.",172,3

The texture is nice, silky without being oily, not thick or too creamy... so it felt nice on my skin, but in the end it just didn't do anything to help with dark spots. I ended up going with a Rx hydroquinone cream and that has made the difference, and costs less than many of these correcting/dark spot creams.",76,5

I have always had a hard time using moisturizers because they were always too greasy or felt unnatural on my skin, so I always started using them, then eventually stopped. I have not had issues with dark spots, other than freckles, which I actually like, so I probably wouldn't have bought the product on my own. However, I love this product.

This is not that product.  This mascara comes out of the tube very ""wet"".  I curl my lashes and it is so wet that it will undo the curl and weigh them down.  It does not separate my lashes, in fact it does the opposite.  It clumps them together.  It does absolutely nothing for volume.  And if I happen to accidentally get a little bit of it on the water line under the lashes of my upper lid, it STINGS.  By no means did I expect this mascara (or any mascara for that matter), to give me Kardashian type results but I was hopeful for at least one positive result.  It miserably falls short of even reasonable expectations.",175,6

This was the first mascara in decades that didn't give me bloodshot, irritated eyes. But after three or four weeks, the same old problems came back. It got very clumpy, and my eyes got irritated by the end of the day. This is probably because there are no preservatives. So at $18.75 once a month (or less when it's on sale at Whole Foods), it's a much better deal than Chanel, Lancome, etc., which have cause me misery for years.",96,8

The opening of the tube broke on the third use, so the whole wand pulls out without having the piece in place that wipes some of it off to evenly distribute the product on the brush.

Peter Sellers did another uncannily dead on imitation of an accent, to go with his many imitations of accents from England and America, and he got to read some actual GBS lines, which was nice.  There was more language from the George Bernard Shaw play than I had expected.  Dennis Price and Alistair Sim offer nice comic support.  I just wish they could have used an actress less concerned with how she looked and more interested in the language of the play.  Sophia Loren's performance almost ruined the film for me.",100,12

Both were ""knock yourself out"" parts with an over-the-top type of woman.  Again, there is such a notable difference in Ms. Smith's portrayals.  In this one, she definitely exhibits the energy, but successfully I thought.  In ""Travels,"" the aplomb was a bomb.  I was actually embarrassed for her.  It was an era of wacky and outlandish characters and doings with, again, at least one high energy character.  For me, this production carried it off without chewing up the scenery.  Definitely interested in revisits here, but nevermore for the annoying ""Travels,"" Ms. Smith's painful parts included.

Good supporting cast that includes Alistair Sim as Loren's barrister, Vittorio De Sica as a sweat shop owner, and Dennis Price(""Kind Hearts and Coronets"") as Loren's psychiatrist.

This is later reinforced throughout the first half of the film, when we see  her with her friends and family. Finally, unable to combat her  psychosomatic illness, she withdraws to a retreat in New Mexico run by a  subtly tyrannical new-age leader.

Todd Haynes' other films -  Poison, and Velvet Goldmine  - are visually striking, and the framing of  Safe reminded me of artwork. This formality however distances us from the  narrative, and seems to highlight the miscasting of Julianne Moore.  Moore's previous supporting roles showed a tartness which was very  appealing. However it is perverse of Haynes to cast her as a bimbo. She may  have the skin for her character but she really isn't believable, and Haynes  strands her in his huge long shots. When she is called upon to give a  speech near the end of the film, it is almost embarassing.  The story  behind Safe is interesting enough but I think it could have been much more  than the curio that it is, if Haynes had used Jessica Harper in the lead,  rather than giving her only a few minutes of screen time in a supporting  role.",170,1

I reality, there are real  medical centers (like EHC-D in Dallas) that treats this disease.

It's understated and drab, just what the film succeeds at best. The music, the clothing and the sets evoke the '80s, the time of the film.

Carol's illness is real, and serves as a metaphor for her alienation from society. Our modern world makes her sick on many levels, but no-one will help her, only blame her. I don't think the movie is as ambiguous as some claim: it's clear that we're meant to sympathise with Carol, and not with her bored husband, uncaring doctor, and greedy self-help guru.

Movies_and_TV,6304286481,5.0,positive,"This is one of my favorite 80's films set in NYC night culture. Based on Jay McInery's classic novel. This movie I call the Less Than Zero of the east coast. Break out character for Michael J Fox. The story MJ Fox plays Jamie Conway a cocaine addicted journalist for a NY magazine who can't let go of the past. His character really struggles with letting go and adversity. Phoebe Cates plays his model wife who leaves him. He just recently lost his mother. The flashbacks really show how the past haunts him. He is struggling with cocaine addiction going out partying at NYC nightclubs. His life is spinning out of control. You can't help but feel sorry  for his character.  A film about one man's high  expectations on himself without letting go of the past. Great soundtrack and NYC setting. Essential to collection, a great  80's NYC culture film.",150,6

Having read the book before seeing the moving gave me a bit more insight into the story.

Fox in comedies like ""Back to the Future"" and I was absolutely  shocked to see him in this type of role. My innocent childhood hero looked  like a horrible person in this movie--because he portrayed a horrible  person. After watching this film, I vowed to never touch a drug in my life  and I keep that vow. Jamie Conway (Fox's character) is a cocaine snorting,  selfish, scary individual with serious problems who finally hits rock  bottom. It took me years before I was able to accept Fox in other roles  after being literally taken in by his performance. As far as entertainment  value, this film keeps you interested but it isn't for casually viewing  because you'll be feeling the power of it long after you watch and that  state of mind stays with you.

The thing about this movie that makes me say it could have been better was it left holes. Perhaps that was intentional and I'm just a plodding predictable movie viewer but I didn't like how in one scene you see a photograph of the detective, his daughter and Emily and they are all smiling. This for me was a WTF moment. This was never explained in the movie and the connection of how Emily knew what she did about the detective's wife's accident is another weird moment. Vern's (Adrian Paul) involvement is creepy but still cool. The riddle game was interesting but what did the flashing photos have to add besides shock or creep out value? Anyway this for me is a once in awhile viewing pleasure. Watch it once and then hope you forget before you watch it again. Best part is the beginning when Ian Mcshane is intergotating Emily.

The audio it picked up at 3 feet had to be amplified beyond reason (everything maximized to get almost normal speech volume), and when I did, the audio quality was worse than what you'd from a cell phone call.

Admittedly, I'm using a Mac to test this on, and they have unpowered mic jacks, as opposed to PC's typical powered and unpowered varieties. Since the mic uses a battery, I don't think the lack of a powered jack was the issue, but since I don't have a PC to test it on, I can't say any more than for Mac users to stay away from this product.

The one weakness is that there is no light to indicate that the unit is on, therefore it is possible to leave the unit on without knowing it, and run the battery down.  And then there's no way to know if your battery is run-down except by the terrible or non-existent recordings that result.

As soon as I loaded the chalk in the prongs, some held tight & a couple did not, I notice the prongs twisting. I can't imagine they will last very long with such thin wire. Since I couldn't give it a negative number of stars, I'll just say -5! So, I guess I paid to buy an example that the hubs can use to make one. Very disappointed, indeed!",116,11

Musical_Instruments,B0002L51D8,4.0,positive,"My cymbals were definitely brighter after using this, and finger smudges were taken off (for a day!). I had to use more than one application and rub hard for any serious cleaning. It's not good for trying to reverse any aging of cymbals or serious deep cleaning, you really should think of it only as a surface cleaner or as a ""brightener"". Possibly with a brush of some sort it might work better in the grooves, but generous application of the product and rubbing with a soft rag didn't seem to achieve penetration of the cleaning process into those grooves. That's probably reasonable and to be expected - anything that cleaned very aggressively may be on the border of being a threat to the cymbal surface.

The stuff has a noxious smell. I cleaned my cymbals outdoors and even then the wind shifted and I feared for the effect on my eyes. I have three cymbals (ride, crash, and top high hat) and when used generously one bottle was good for two separate cleanings of the full set.",178,3

The product is easy to useabd very effective in cutting through fingerprint oxidation and restoring the original color and luster. It is an acid based product so be careful when applying to the logos if you want to preserve them. I cover them with blue painters tape and then remove after I have cleaned the entire cymbal. The fumes are very strong, and being an acid, will make you cough if inhaled. I found that diluting the product 3:1 part water was very effective and a little less noxious.

Mostly everyone puts fingerprints on everything without a care and Sabian brilliant cymbals turn orange with a humid breeze. Notice this is cleaner and not polish. If I pulled out the Brasso every time I needed a set of cymbals to be stage worthy, I would spend my entire life polishing cymbals. I hit them with this stuff for 30 sec a side and wipe. They look great. Gets rid of most of the gunk and discoloration and the logos are all still intact. I do this about 6 times between real polishing and as a result I can spend time with my kids.

Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,"Since I was planning on using these infrequently (in plays and skits), and never leaving them permanently in the hands of children, I was less concerned with durability than with cost. These are not likely to survive three days in the unsupervised hands of kids, but as functioning tambourines, they are great props for use in a 15 to an hour play.

If you are new to Tambourines, I suggest you buy a wooden mallet to use with this kind. If, as I was planning, you were thinking of getting the drum effect by striking the head with the hand, and not getting much sound from the jingles, you will be disappointed. Striking the head with the finger will always give you jingle as well. I bought soft mallets to use with them, and that didn't work, because they had the feel of a finger. Only when I bought hard wooden strikers did I get a relatively pure sound from the head, with little jingle.

The other side of the coin is that with your hard mallet, you can get two distinctly different sounds from the one device.",188,7
Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,"This was an impulse buy, and I do wish I had done some more research.  The zils (the metal pieces that clang) block out the thump of hitting the drum head, so I wish I had bought a tambourine with just a single row.  I'm not sure what the tambourine head is made out of, but it is pulled tight and seems durable.  It does say it is an ""economy"" tambourine, which is accurate.

Just having the volume  35% of the way up and speaking into the mic, the low frequencies of the vocal make the speaker buzz, or vibrate in the casing of the monitor. All 3 mics did that. And the Eq's were all straight up at the 12 o' clock setting, which is probably 0 db. This monitor basically does what most hot spot style monitors do. They can't handle any kind of volume and sound like AM radio. I even tried turning down the low eq to almost -10, and it did the same thing, just not as bad. I might try using this with a friend's band who is performing this weekend in a small club, but honestly, as a pro level touring sound engineer(and as a musician myself), I can tell you that I don't want to put a buzzy speaker that can't be turned up loud in front of any musician.

Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,"So far so good. I really didn't expect it to be as good as it actually is. I bought it for a few purposes. One of which was to be a personal monitor for our drummer. I sat it on a mic stand beside him and turned the volume knob halfway up and he liked what he heard. Mission accomplished. This saved us a lot in the way of needed equipment because we didn't have a powered monitor for him and had to use an fairly heavy monitor amp and passive speaker, plus a stand for the speaker. It lightened our load some, and any working band knows what a plus that is. As long as you don't expect it to sound like a 15"" speaker with 200+ watts pushing it (because that would just be silly lol) you'll like it.

Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,"Pros: It's the most portable and the least expensive USB MIDI keyboard out there.

Cons: It is very difficult to use for recording music. The ""keys"" are built like a laptop keyboard. It's difficult for entering chords, playing melodies. The keys don't provide the proper feel when playing. They squish when you press them. It's hard to explain.

Its Ok for entering in melodies one note at a time. I can see how this could be very useful for the traveling composer because it is extremely thin, but that portability comes at a price: usability. I should have bought the Akai LPK25 instead.

Normally, I love Korg products. They make some of the most amazing, innovative stuff (Like the KAOS series)it's just that this product does not provide the tactile feedback of a real keyboard and it is too difficult to enter chords for me.

Verdict: This keyboard is extremely portable, so it's a good 2nd keyboard for the traveling composer, but I would not recommend using it as a primary keyboard in a home studio, as it only provides very limited utility.",183,9

Enter the Nano Key. It does everything I need for entering MIDI data into the DAW, it's velocity sensitive, meaning the harder you hit the key the louder the note sounds. I'm sure some will say its light weight or a cheap piece of plastic but I don't intend to do much pounding on the keys...after all, I'm not Little Richard or Jerry Lee Louis. LOL

Only drawbacks are expected ones because its such an entry level device. The keys have no pivot point and feel like computer keys rather than piano keys. The keyboard itself is scaled down significantly so playing chords can get quite squashed. Also the pitch bend tool is a button not a wheel so you have no control over the speed of the bend or the inflection amount.

For a basic cheap MIDI controller it is fantastic and does the job very well. I use it primarily for input into Finale 2010 via the speedy entry tool and it works perfectly. Takes up very little real estate on my desk which is a bonus!",133,12

Never played the keyboard before and purchased this one to create simple chord progressions (one octave only).
Very limited space between keys and very bad sensitivity: unables you to make nuances or to make accents decently.
Very good to ""on the go"" music because of its size, but not rugged enough. Keys started to fall apart around two months after purchase.

SOFTWARE
Very good software included and easy to install too.
Tested it in CUBASE 3,4,5 REAPER and various VSTs : the key mapping is almost perfect in every case.

Overall I consider the product more like in the ""toy"" side than for professional use.",106,15
Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,"I've gone through three of these in the last two years. I guess I don't learn too easily.

The first one broke because the USB connection cracked. I opened it up to see if it could be repaired, and realized the only thing that had been holding the connector to the circuit board was a tiny blob of solder. The second one lost several of its keys because I had it in a padded laptop bag. The slightest amount of pressure will cause the keys to fly off like springs, and they're designed in such a way that they can never be put back on correctly.

I'm now on my third nanokey. a few keys have popped off this one as well. I've glued them back on with silicon, but this affects the action. But even in new condition, the key action on this device is no more playable than a computer keypad. How such a product ever got past the R&D stage is incredible.

You'll have to get use to the small amount of key stroke, compared to any real keyboard. For single note entry, it's fine. However, if you want to enter a three-note chord with any black notes, forget it. You know how when you depress the edges of black keys that you slide in depressing the far inside part of the white key? Well, there is no far inside part of the white key; it doesn't exist, which makes chord entry very slow. Four-note chord with any black keys? Forget it.

It is OK if you take care of it, but useless when you have to throw it away.

Akai came out with the LPK25, which is the same concept, but looks more like a real keyboard.  It is about the same width and depth as the Nanokey, but is over twice as thick which may or may not be a factor for you.  The LPK25 adds an arpeggiator, but drops the pitch-bend buttons.

This is essentially a computer keyboard with large buttons.  I plugged it into my PC and loaded up Mixcraft 5.

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"The Radius is one of two available shock mounts of the Blue Yeti.  That's the reality.

Is it overpriced?  Yes.  Does it do the job?  Also yes.  However, the thumbscrew that comes with the shock mount is extremely prone to breaking.

Due to the extreme weight of the Yeti and whatever pop filter you use, the Radius will inevitably sag.  Some users suggest exchanging the plastic washers included with the Radius for the rubber o-rings from the original Yeti stand.  That is a mistake.

The o-rings merely provide a different form of friction.  Less surface area of the o-rings will make contact, and the o-rings will eventually wear out.  They will work temporarily, however.

The solution?  Get an M5 hex cap screw from the hardware store, and use that in place of the thumbscrew.  Yes, you will have to use a special wrench to tighten it -however, your shock mount will be rock solid.

I'm docking a star because the thing is hilariously overpriced.  The fixture is large, which might make it more expensive, but for a product that comes with flawed hardware.. I expect more for the price.",189,38

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"Here are a few reasons why you should not even consider purchasing this mount:

1.) It's massive. Put two pop cans on top of each other. That's the approximate diameter.

2.) It doesn't support the weight of a Blue Yeti Mic. Not only does it not support the weight (constantly swings down because the little screw can't stay tight enough to keep it up) but the mount itself weighs a ton. This makes it a nightmare for any spring-based arm.

3.) It brakes after a couple months of use. That little screw I mentioned that holds it up? Yes, it snapped off; due to, I'm guessing, constantly having to re-tighten it for the mount to stay up.

4.) Just read the other plethora of reviews saying the same thing as me.

I was lucky enough that Amazon allowed me to return the product but I'm still out $10 for restocking.",150,42

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,"I'm very serious, this shock mount gets 2 stars because of one little screw.

Allow me to explain.

I got this mount for the same reason anyone does. Its the mount MADE for the blue yeti. That said, its huge and a bit unwieldy. On top of that, my mic was ""drooping"" every day, and so every day I'd untighten the screw, move the mic back up, and tighten it again... this process got old, fast. So finally I tightened it as hard as I could, and lo and behold, the screw snaps! I was startled, because I'm NOT a strong person at all. I looked at the screw and ITS MADE OF PLASTIC. Please be warned! This screw is cheap plastic, and will NOT hold the mic up at all! Until they fix this part, DO NOT BUY.

This isn't even shoddy workmanship, this is pure bad design and laziness. Cheapness, even. There is ZERO reason for this part to be made of plastic. Its a SCREW! Something like this should never happen.",174,44
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"It looks great but it was very heavy and made the Yeti huge. It was so heavy that it brought the stand down, no matter what adjustments I made. Ended up using the Yeti without it and I'm fine with it for podcasting.",43,45

It's very disappointing because I can't afford a different mic at this point, and the only shock mount available for the Blue Yeti is this one.

I was *very* careful with tightening the thumbscrew, but gradually over time it wouldn't hold the mic in place and it would pivot down.  I tried to tighten it tonight, and the screw sheered off when I turned the thumb screw.  I've only had the mount since 2/28/2014..  Very disappointed.",122,50

Do NOT buy this unless you are interested in frustrating yourself to no end.  If you must use the Blue Yeti, use a mic stand, not a swing arm.  If you prefer the swing arm, go with a different mic/shock-mount combo.

It can barely hold the Mic without falling, and I had to use a wrench to tighten it perfectly. I am worried I will strip it and break the mount. Other than that, it seems fine.

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"Works extremely well, took quite a bit of effort to adequately tighten the thumbscrew that holds the mic itself in place.

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"I want to say that I love it, but...This shock mount is very short.  By that I mean that the shock chords are short, taking very little shock away from the microphone's receptivity.  In other words, sounds do get transmitted to the mic.  The best bet is to place your mic on a thick bath towel folded over several times.  That will absorb much of the shock created from a desk mount stand.  But the shock mount is supposed to work on a boom.  I do have one set up in my studio, but as I said, it is about 80% effective.  I will say this, it's ok for the price.  If you visit a microphone store where you can see all the professional shock mounts, they can run into hundreds of dollars.  A really good mic with a really good boom requires a really good shock mount.  The professional set up I am talking about can cost from $2,000 to as much as $10,000.  If you're an interneet podcaster like me, then you don't want to go there.  The Blue Microphone shock mount works very well with the Yeti.  I highliy recommend it for the price.",197,70

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"Despite other users having issues, I ordered this shock mount to use with my Yeti and was glad to find out that it DOES fit the threaded insert in the bottom of the Yeti.

Pros:
- Worked with the Yeti!
- Reduced noise significantly
- Looks nice
- Feels sturdy

Cons:
- It's gigantic
- Elastic is too tight

Overall, it works well, but would work even better with slightly more shock reduction. The elastic bands are too sturdy and are still passing along some amount of shock. It's not enough to make the shock mount a bad value, but it's enough to cost it a 5th star on my review.",111,98

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"I bought this mount and paired it with a Blue Yeti and Rode PSA Swivel mount. All three work perfectly together and the shock mount allows the microphone/arm combo to move smoothly. The only issue i had//have is that when connecting the Yeti to this mount is that when if feels like the mic has tightened all the way, there is a gap between the base of the mount and the mic itself. This problem is that this allows the move and clang and bang. I used some shims to keep it tight but, I would expect the mount/mic to be flush. I'll upload a picture to show what I mean. Other than that minor hiccup, awesome shock mount for the Blue Yeti!",123,101

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"This item was a huge disappointment. It looks nice, but it does not function in anyway like it should. The thumbscrew to lock the head at the appropriate angle is made of pot metal. I never once got it tight enough to hold the microphone at the right angle without it slipping. This could have been easily solved by putting teeth on the joint so that it would lock. After 3 weeks of trying to tighten it enough to hold the microphone horizontal the thumbscrew simply sheared off in my hand. It didn't once hold it correctly and now it is just a pile of junk that I will have to bore out and put my own hardware into. To top it off this joint attaches to the main frame with about 1/8"" of slop so that even if this joint was made tight the entire frame can rock up and down.

Basically, this is some stylized pot metal that I regret buying. I purchased a rode microphone arm with this and a Blue Yeti Pro microphone. Both are fantastic, but I hope no one else has to deal with this thing.",192,104
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,"It seems to be constructed well. However the screw that joins the shock mount to the base of the Blue Yeti binds. It does not want to screw in all the way by hand, and I would not attempt to use tools to tighten for fear of stripping the threads.",50,105

I couldn't get the microphone to thread up properly, I kept thinking it was me because mic threads are pretty universal.  Before I knew it I stripped all of the threads out of the Yeti.  I currently have a service request into Blue to replace both items.  Now that I look at the reviews I am most certainly not the only person with this issue with the Radius.  However, it looks like we're isolated meaning there are some mounts that are fine and some that are not.  So when you recieve this item and you can't get the microphone to thread do not keep trying over and over, either return the item to amazon for another, or contact Blue.  I might update the rating on this when I get the new shockmount and microphone but for now I have no choice but to say I hate this item...",181,106

I placed a nylon washer in the open space to fix the issue. Only bad thing is my grip of the screw is a little messed up from the pliers so its not easy to take off. Fortunately, it stays on the stand at all times.",105,114

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,"If you are the owner of a Yeti micophone and you need to isolate the mic with a shock mount, then this is the mount to get.

Combine with a good boom stand... and you have a nice piece of kit.",52,125
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"For the brand and price I expected better quality.  I think they went more for style and looks when designing this.  I used it with a desktop mic boom and every key pressed on my keyboard when right up through it and into the mic.  This resulted in a slight muffled background sound that was annoying.

To solve the problem I bought a floor mic stand with boom.  This solution works great with the shock mount and Blue Yeti.

I think the problem is that the ties between parts are too small and tight.  I looked at the shock mounts for Blue's higher end mics and they are designed with longer ties.  I also used the Samson shock mount that was wonderful with the Samson mic. It has longer ties that are more flexible.  So, I believe this shock mount, which looks cool, is just flawed in design.  For the money asked, I would have expected them just to do what they know works.

On a side note...the Blue Yeti that goes with the shock mount is wonderful!",178,126
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"Hello,
Before purchasing this shock mount I emailed Blue support.
I previously had the Ringer Universal Shockmount for my SnowBall Mic.
Looking at the pictures it looked like the same shock mount to me.
So the emailed I sent was asking if the two were the same, and if i could just order the attachment piece that looked different to hold the Yeti.
Never heard back from them.
Emailed a couple of times asking the same question.
Finally just bought the Radius shock mount.
The two are the same except the piece the holds the mic to the shock mount.",100,127
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,"I bought the Yeti and then the Yeti Pro microphone by Blue. Wonderful mics, but the lack - at the time - of a workable shock mount, left me feeling less than satisfied. The recently released Radius Shock Mount is perfect. It fits great. Attaches and un-attaches easily. And the look is stellar - both vintage and rather spacey. I'm definitely going to buy a second one for the other mic.

Note: When you remove the mic from it's original stand, screw the attaching bolts back into the mic. Otherwise, you're left with two holes in the side of the mic.",101,128

However, I realized too late that this wrench is much to short to be even slightly accurate. You're going to be struggling for a long time trying to get it in tune. On top of that, the fit of the wrench is less than ideal; it has a lot of wiggle room. Definitely not something you want for a tuner, as it will slip off if you let go of it.

The worst part of it is that after about 3 or so hours of using it, the handle slipped right off of the metal wrench part. Seems like very cheap glue was used to secure the two pieces.

I can not recommend this product. I suggest spending more money and getting a tool you can be accurate with that will also save you time!",150,10

1. It's way too small. You need to attack something to the back to extend it if you want the leverage to tune easily and accurately.

2. It bends a lot. It has a lot of give. This makes it really hard to tune accurately since the thin neck of this hammer will bend quite a few degrees before it provides enough pressure to the tuning pin to turn it.

3. This has a square hole instead of a star. The star is superior.

Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,"This broke on a D key (one with two strings). It's good for its price and works fine on the keys that have 3 strings, but it can't handle much pressure at all.",33,34
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,"Not a very reliable or effective tuning hammer. It barely grips the pegs, and some pegs just slide around inside it.",21,35
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,"It fits to tune the piano but after a while I was getting a lot of play, the tool will soon strip and I will have to buy another, better off getting a better quality on",36,36
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,"The plastic handle snapped on the very first attempt to tune.  I'm still using it without the handle, and it works fine....just a little awkward.  You get what you pay for.",31,37
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,Great tool.  Saved me $500 on a retuning.,8,38
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,Very cheaply made - soft metal barely made it through one tuning before being so stripped it was useless.  Returned and ordered a different one.,25,39
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,"While this hammer works fine, I should have bought one with a longer handle. The hammer is quite small, which makes it difficult to fine-tune the strings. A larger hammer would make it easier to make small movements or adjustments when trying to tune a piano. It takes forever to get a string exactly in tune. I think it is worth to spend a bit more money and get a better hammer. with a larger handle",76,40
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,"This tuning hammer, together with the mute kit and the Olympus L-12 recorder with tuner, all helped me in tuning my daughter's piano and will probably keep helping me in the future.",32,41
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,It stripped out on the second tuning pin I used on. A waste of money.,15,42
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,This wrench allowed me to tune my antique piano for free along with an android phone tuning application. I am very happy with it.,24,43
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,"This worked great for my needs, which was to loosen the strings on my piano to get to the screws underneath, which I needed to unscrew to remove the string plate from the back of the piano, and then hang it on my wall as a decorative piece.",48,44
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,"This is a very inexpensive tuning hammer, but it works,  and I'm glad I finally got one, so I can make tiny tuning corrections to my piano.",27,45
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,"Terrible product. Not only does the length of the handle make for inaccurate tuning, but its head fits the tuning pin loosely (I had actually measured the size of my tuning pins beforehand, and they fit exactly the measurements of the head). While trying to tune my piano, I had to jimmy the tool to get it to turn, and when it turned it did so at an odd angle. After being nearly done with my first note with this tool, the head itself stripped.

All in all, this thing will definitely turn two or three tuning pins, but don't count on it to tune your entire piano. Its much more difficult to use it than it should be, and more likely than not it will cause damage to your piano, like it did mine.",135,46
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,1.0,negative,Came rusty in the package. Didn't bother returning. Just threw it away for fear of tetanus.,16,47
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,Was skeptical but it was so cheap I gave it a try. I have a Weber baby grand at my vacation home and cannot easily schedule tunings to align with when I am there. But I wanted to get some of the bad odd notes fixed. Did the trick! I used a phone app for tuning and this. Did entire piano in about 2 hours first try and now do as needed. Not a replacement for long term care but great for my situation.,84,48
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,2.0,negative,Soft metal starting to strip inside. Square now looks more like a circle after about 8 hours of tuning.,19,49
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,4.0,positive,Quite small and makes it hard to reach the point one wants when tuning,14,50
Musical_Instruments,B00CMKFO66,5.0,positive,Worked perfect and made piano tuning much easier.,8,51
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,"Great value but they need some weight at the bottom.  When you extend the boom, the stand will fall over.

Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,"These are very very light duty stands.  They might be ok for home or home studio use, but not much beyond that.  They are light, flimsy with low grade plastic and metal parts.  Not for any kind of professional application.",40,2

Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,"Light Light duty, not at all what I expected. When a mic is placed, the stand topples",17,4
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,"These are very lightweight, intelligently designed stands. When I ordered them, I thought they were just giving you *a choice* of mic clips for each stand; I didn't realize that they were designed to have both clips on, simultaneously, in different places. Interesting! Why not? :^)

So, these are not real heavy-duty. I wouldn't let Big Ed the roadie manhandle them, and I wouldn't mount any Neumann U87s on them. But for spares to have around the studio, they're great... Especially for less than $15 apiece. Recommended.",87,5
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,"Its a great purchase! It may be of a cheap material, but it gives many possibilities of movement.",18,6
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,"Pretty good stands for the money I suppose.  I wouldn't think they would be rugged enough to withstand multiple transportation scenarios.  At least, not without putting them in a protective case of some kind.",34,7
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,It came as expected. Could be bit more sturdy but makes sense for the cost.,15,8
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,Literally useless. These don't even work for my 8 year olds jam room set up. Total TRASH all plastic (even the screw in parts) ZERO STARS,26,9
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,Really cheaply made. But... 4 for the price of one quality stand.,12,10

Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,5.0,positive,"I wait and write reviews, till I've had time to actually use them. I bought these for my daughters at Christmas last year., who are in a choir, and the mic stands are more solid than they appear, and inexpensive.  I needed this type, so I could use them in front of the choir, but the stands set out to the side, so as not to block the view from our audience.",72,12
Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,These were very flimsy - got them for church and our singers said to return them.,16,13

Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,1.0,negative,"Came with a damaged box, broken pieces, and missing clips. Im glad it did though. One look at how crappy this thing was made and I was sure glad I had a reason to return it that wouldnt cost me a restocking fee. Not even close to pro audio.",49,16

Musical_Instruments,B00KV3NOIQ,4.0,positive,The microphone holders are not big enough for wider mics. But works nicely besides that.,15,18

Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,Recording to USB drive worked fine for a month and now nothing! We use multiple USB drives in rotation at the church to record sermons and songs  to mp3. This was the ideal tool ...for a little over a month. Totally disappointed!,42,2
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,"Same as Gemini RMR-1000 with different lable, no operating instructions,  product states it does not work with above 4gb SD cards, well its working with a 32gb ScanDisk Ultra micro sdHC.
It will record anything you feed it via RCA.",40,3

Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,"First of all this is a no frills recorder there is no way to do anything to your recordings other than adjust the volume of input and playback.  The buttons can be buggy and need pressed quick and hard not held.  Upon booting up I have had the sound be very quiet like the auto gain inside the unit isn't on, restart fixes this.  The sound through the headphones has problems on my unit there is interference and other sounds so it isn't good as an extra line out for audio playback.  The recordings do not suffer from this problem however and sound great recorded at 128MP3.  Sometimes the buttons don't respond and the unit takes a few seconds sometimes up to 10 secs to set up.  Finally it only accepts 4gb and under SD cards and no SDHC.  The usb stick seems to handle any size.  This isn't perfect but it is better than the Gemini recorder.  Does the job with a little patience.",165,5
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,2.0,negative,I can't  get it to work with my mixer.  Can't say how well it works cause I think I need to update my other equipment.,25,6

Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,"What a piece of junk!  It records sporadically, but never consistently.  Tried to use the recorder to record via a USB stick.  Some tests worked, some didn't - nothing recorded.  Missed several recordings because,even though it said it was ready and recording timer was ticking after hitting rec button, nothing recorded.  Not an improper wiring issue since some tests worked fine with the audio system.  No hard copy user's manual and no online manual.  Lousy customer support for this product.  I should have spent a little more and got something that actually works.",93,10
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,5.0,positive,I got 2 of these and they work great love it and the only thing I don't like about it is it don't have a remote but other then that Love it,32,11

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,"The white controller boxes don't seem to be quality.  I bought 5 of these, none worked well enough to be usable.  You'll notice this issue if your lights, or a variation of a color stays light/on when you turn the power off.  It's like these control boxes are not stopping all the power from going through when in off mode, so that's an issue.  The LED strings look good, the remotes look good, it's just the power/controller white box that doesn't seem to perform up to standards.  With 5 sets, we tried all combinations to make sure to rule out everything other possible component in failure.  Uniformly, it was the white little controller box that seemed to have the issue.  Not sure how to resolve this, maybe a better controller will make these use-able?",134,0

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,great lights adhesive strip did not work had to buy additional hangers but for the price pretty cool lite set.,20,3
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,"Lights work very well but I have two issues:
-- Minor issue is that the remote is very weak. It only works at half the distance of my TV; receiver, or satellite remotes.
- Major issue is that the power supply connections are so loose they are constantly working themselves apart and have to be pushed back together often. Unfortunately where I have this installed that is VERY difficult and in reality should never have to be done.",78,4
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,"Received on time.  Typical Chinese instructions in broken English and very fine print. Have seen similar lights for MSRP of $39  & $49 for only 1 meter length.  Remote is necessary but dysfunctional.  But hey at this price this is a bargain. Not sure if can daisy chain or not.  According to instructions no but looking at unit it looks like yes. Haven't tried yet.  They are bright, with adjustable light intensity, various colors.  Mostly used for accent/mood lighting up stairwell and behind curtains for nice effects. For this price, it is a good buy.  Not sure how long they will last .",103,5
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,Saw this for much higher prices but decided to give this a try.  Directions are typical Chinese but pretty simple to operate.  Have to plug in correctly (even knowing that I got wrong first time around) and there is a line coming out of the white plug in that goes no where.  Has pull tab for battery and takes standard lithium battery easy to find.  Have not figured it all out but it is really pretty cool item letting you change colors and pick how you want to operate.  For mood or Christmas lighting clever LED item.  How long it will last have no idea but at price I paid does not make a lot of difference.  On other sellers saw some adverse comments but so far this is working well.  Will use to replace some of my older Christmas lights next season.,143,6
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,Its a lot of stuff for $10  it broke soon after turning it on but I was able to fix the defective transistor.  I am just it was just a fluke.  The lights work great still not sure what to use them for but fun to play with.,48,7

Could be a great product...",75,9
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,"Just received my replacement of the Generic LED, and like others, my two units will not turn off.  Although the colors on the remote actually match the correct colors of the led when on, off is RED, not off.  The only way to turn off the lights is to unplug the power.  This unit is the second one with the same problem.",62,10
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,I found this on a one day sale for $6 and bought it on impulse. They were impressive for $6 but half the strand no longer changes colors and is now stuck on white only. I bought the more expensive Inateck brand strip and it's much better. But for $6 I can't be too mad.,55,11
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,Lights seam fine but I bought two of these light kits and one controller shorted between the red and green so the red led lit up whenever the green lit up. And both power supplies are faulty. One never worked and one only works when lights are almost fully dimmed. One star cause the lights do work.,57,12
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,"I know these things need fine tuning on the production end, (control module?), but for the price and the amazing effect they have I will still go with 5 stars. They may not last forever, (although I have two sets doing some lighting at church and have been for about a year), but if you only get a feel for the possibilities with this set, it will be worth it.",70,13
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,"I bought 2 of these one had a section of lights that was partially burnt out would only produce two colors right, and neither of the strands shut off all the way I would try a set with a different reciever as it does not work vary good with the remote.",51,14
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,Like some others mine will not shut off all the way.  The green stays on after multiple attempts to turn it off and ended up unplugging it.,27,15
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,Worked great for the first 15 minutes then it failed to respond to commands requested and received a replacement with the same issues receive your credit,26,16

I'm not sure if this item is defective or not, but pressing the ""Power Off"" button won't turn off the LED strip, it just make it switch a very dimmed green color (the light are still on) instead. Also, the LED strip gets very hot just after about 5 minutes leaving it on steady lit.",65,18
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,Very inexpensive and worked great. These led's are bright but can also be dimmed. Plan ahead when laying these strips down as there are parts in line with the cord that need to be out of sight.,37,19

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,"The LED strip is amazing in terms of light output and programmability.  However,  the sticky back is a little weak and the remote range is very lacking (1 or 2 ft at the most).  Still, great value for the money.",40,22

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,"These light are great for indoor use. The lights themselves are waterproof but the control box and power box are not waterproof.

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,Returned them. Odd colors/Not solid. Full light at one end-no light at the other. Makes you feel its going to blow-up it looks so odd. May be worh $5- for the plugs?,32,26
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,"Kit came with everything needed (except for connectors if you want to cut the strip). Still going strong today. The sticky material used to hold the strip up isn't all that great so be prepared to use 3m tape or something else to supplement. The light is bright enough and can be dimmed or brightened up from the remote. Remote works well....feels super cheap, but they're all the same. I have a few of these from multiple different companies/vendors and they vary very little in design.",86,27
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,"When I first plugged this in I loved it!  BUT:  The ""3M"" tape does not stick well at all.  The jumper wires needed if you want to make turns make horrible connections that short out very easily.  I spent over $30 to get this mounted properly, and then the controller completely quit!

Save your money.  Spend a little more on a higher quality LED product and be happy.",68,28
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,"These are pure garbage. One of the power supplies didn't even work. The adhesive doesn't stick to anything, one slight bend and half of the strips went out. Straight in the TRASH!!",32,29
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,"So they don't turn completely off, and the battery was almost dead a day after I started using it.  Or so I thought...?  Not all the colors that are on the remote display, the entire red column doesn't work for me...except when I power off - then there's a red glow.

Sticky back needs additional adhesive.  I'm going to leave them in place, never change the color while I look for another controller box.",74,30

Files are great, nut spacing ruler is great and mine wasn't sharp like others said, the action ruler is a nice laminate cardboard with a really cool scale design on the sides that make it easy to get a good measurement on the string, and the string winder actually is two pieces and the end comes off and has a hex for an electric drill so you don't have to manually wind.

The material that the brushes are made from is brittle and they break off at the point where they leave the handle.  After maybe 3 hours of use, I'm down to just 4 bristles on one of them.  Shame because I like the feel, but they're just so badly made, I have to go to 1-star, and definitely do not recommend anyone buy these.

I like the weight, but they're not brilliantly made.  The plastic caps from the ends fall off, and when they're fully extended, the ends of the brushes left in the handles rattle pretty bad.  The handles are a little short too.  Another 1 1/2"" would make all the difference.  But, cheap, so good enough.",125,2

It's also very quiet; almost 25%-30% less volume output than my Firewire Solo. For the price I cannot even recommend it as a Windows interface as it would be wholly unnecessary. It does exactly what is says on the box, bu the box does not give you the whole story, and neither M-Audio's website or the Amazon description mention the sample and bit rate limitations. It's possible that a firmware or drier update could correct these issues but it honestly shouldn't have to. I cannot give a recommendation to anyone in regards to this device.",134,1

Seems to attach to the underside of a desk rather sturdily also. The left & right swivels are nice & make things convenient. The tilt works nice, the lock to control it works nice as well. it slides in to tuck away completely, as long as you install it far enough back. This thing is wide & can be very long when pulled out completely. All good traits in my book. The only downside to this product is that it hinges all it's support in the middle of the tray, making the platform quite wobbly. It doesn't feel weak or unstable, just wobbly.

1) There is bit of vibration when I type. In this regards it is much better than the Fellows keyboard tray it is replacing, but it is not as solid as my workstation at work. Hard to characterize the actual amount of bounce, suffice to say I can live with it but it is not optimal.

2) There are two width settings (basically comes with three plastic squares, and you can use 2 or 3 of them). I did not have quite enough space for 3, so I ended up using just two. Might have been nice to have more options.

3) The left and right end caps of the keyboard tray are just pressure fit, they are not screwed together. Will have to see how long they hold up. Meanwhile I will try not to fidget with them :-)",153,7

The keyboard tray may have a tendency to retreat downwards slightly for people with firm typing pressure or if the track was not attached to the desk securely.

Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,"This is my first laser printer, and at first I was very happy with it. Then the honeymoon ended. First of all, the toner cartridge is fitted with a ""smart"" chip, so you cannot refill it yourself. This is, in the opinion of many, an illegal practice, as it prevents you from using a third-party toner refill. Note that the 1250W (previous model) does not have this ""feature,"" so you may be better off with that one.

Do not, ever, try to use the duplex printing feature (print on both sides) of the 1350W. If your document ends with an odd-numbered page, the resulting output is misnumbered! Also do not do anything on your computer concurrently with printing, as the driver has a very short attention span, and forgets which page it is printing.

It won't go back up to regular speed unless you install a new Minolta cartridge.
This, of course, is a completely bogus excuse for forcing you to buy Minolta toner (which costs $130).
I called tech support to confirm that there was no workaround, and the woman I spoke with had received 4 complaints that morning on that issue.
So I sent it back and bought a Samsung ML-1710, which, although a little bit slower (17ppm instead of 21) can use any toner and seems like an excellent little printer.",141,2

First problem, I find that the top paper-holder that is suposed to keep the pages in order while they come out doesn't!  Pages end up falling over the front of the front of the machine so that you have to pay extra close attention to make sure you catch all of them, and that they are in order...

Bigger problem is that it jams a lot, and it is VERY difficult to pull the paper(s) out It has a vice-grip on the sheets, so that you end up tugging and wripping the paper.  Then, the area where the torn edge is is too small to fit fingers into to manipulate.  There are not enough removeable parts to aid in paper extraction.

BTW, all tests have been performed on the Dell printer for which the cartridges are intended without any failures. The alignment and nozzles are AOK as well.",126,2

  i told amazon that i would never use their company again but my daughter changed my mind. i can't blame amazon for one bad experience with a company, so i am trying again through another amazon company to get my cartridges.as long as the cartridges do not come from eforcity, i will try one more time.",127,5

To start, the handsets are poorly designed: on my first call I twice hung up on my callers since the ""Off"" button is located exactly where you would rest the phone against your cheek.

Besides this, two of the three handsets had communication problems with the base, even when they were in direct sight of the base, such that they could not maintain a constant dial tone and kept cutting out.",87,5
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,"I recently purchased the four handset version of this system and am very pleased with it. All of the features are convenient and work well and the voice quality is very good. One feature I especially like is that it can store up to 50 names and phone numbers in each handset. And, once programmed in one handset, entries can easily be tranferred to the other handsets if desired. Another convenient feature is that the system can be used as an intercom, with each handset capable of calling each of the other handsets. This is the most complete and most convenient phone system I've ever had and I like the quality and reliability of Panasonic products. Note, however, that this model is just a versatile cordless phone system and does not include an answering system.

Lots of cool features like the little antenna lights up in colors when it rings and several different ring tones.  You can even assign different colors and rings to different callers.  One thing I don't like too much is that there is not a typical sounding ring tone to choose from.  There are no problems with signal strength or range of the phone.  I have one handset upstairs and another in the basement and haven't had a problem with either one.  The phone is pretty easy to program, but I did have to read the instruction booklet.",143,13

Feels solid and comfortable in your hands

Sound quality is good - even at a good distance from the home base

Speaker phone is clear and callers can hear me well

Blinking light on antenna for voice messages

Black & grey color is attractive and looks good almost anywhere in house

Cons:

I wish the keypad had a backlight

Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,Where to begin... Very difficult to hear - even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear.

I bought another filter, thinking the first one had crapped out, but the buzzing persisted. I even had a technician from the cable company come out to check their equipment, which was in perfect working order. I was assured by the cable company that their system would support this phone.

I returned it mainly because of the buzzing.",62,25

I have tested this base on other jacks (still same problem) and I have tested other cordless phones from the existing jack, and they work fine with no buzz.  I'm convinced it is in the base unit of the Panasonic phone.  But after multiple email customer service attempts at Panazonic, I have not yet heard anything from this company.

It's not a big deal except now you have to wait for the coins to go thru and then manually shut it off where before with the automatic motor sensor....you could drop the coins and walk away.

Paper coin tubes drop into the machine's tubes nicely and it's relatively easy to see when it's full if you read the directions.  In sorting about $85 of random coins and jammed about 5 times (mostly user error, aka impatient girlfriend) but overall; job well done.

One thing I will mention that is important... if you don't notice when one coin tube is filled and keep loading coins they will all pill up in the chute and you'll suddenly have a major problem.  Then when you take the over-filled tube out, you have coins falling down the chute and going everywhere.  Again, easy to avoid but you do have to pay attention a little.

Overall, good price and good purchase for the casual coin sorter.",148,123

I never used it for mass sorting, probably 2 dollars change at most! I think over the years I've only used two sets of batteries. I had to toss it last week and I am here to buy a second one. I, like another reviewer, dropped it onto my tile floor and it did not recover well but I do take all of the blame. The only piece that ended up broken seem to be the most important, the rotator to send the coins down the sorting ramp but the motor still worked well.",121,131

Then my seven-year-old nephew played with it for a few hours--repeatedly putting coins in, sorting them all, then dumping them and putting them all back through, and it stopped working completely.

It swallows ink! I don't even pay for my ink and i'm complaining about how much ink this thing uses! I have the settings on Draft and it still goes through ink like no other! Now the ink i can Live with because the prints are actually decent but the scanner and fax!!! Unreal! Anyone who has given this printer a good rating has not used the fax for more than a page.

No exaggeration, I replaced both my color and photo cartridges at the same time with brand new ones.  After printing 6 pages of business cards (which BTW wouldn't print straight on the Lexmark, but printed perfectly on my mono HP laserjet) the photo cartridge was empty. 6 PAGES!  That's all you get folks!  Nothing cheap about this printer except for the construction.  My only other complaint is the lack of driver support.  Lexmark does not support Linux/Unix systems!

The program, (HP) did not uninstall all of the driver information and I had to manually change the port settings on the computer.  The other 2 computers on my wireless loaded the software just fine.

Also, currently the place I buy printer ink does not have ""generic"" replacement inks for this printer.",123,10

Printer worked o.k. for a while, but the cartridge life is very short, and the cartridges themselves are expensive.

Finally, while trying to put a new cartridge in this morning, the printer decided to align itself while I had the door open--and it shattered one of the cartridge bays against the side.  Printer is now useless.

Junk",90,12
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,"So far the only complaint I have is that to turn the power off when you shut down your computer, you have to unplug the printer from the wall.

Then I found out how to bi-pass the warning, and so far it has been three months with the same usage and even though the indicator says that my ink is empty, my printout are as good as when the new cartridge was put into use.  This is very misleading and one could even say that Lexmark is stealing a significant amount of unused ink from its users.",115,15
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,4.0,positive,"The printer has been great.  The duplex and auto feeder is a nice feature with no problems so far.  My two complaints, however, are the software that came with the printer.  Trying to scan documents has not been easy with the software not giving much in the way of options. The other complaint is that the wireless drops off and will not reconnect with my computer.  So, I just keep it pluged in with the USB.",76,16

My biggest complaint, which is leading me to get rid of this printer, is that it drinks ink at an alarming rate.  From an economical stand-point, the initial price is great, but the ink costs are killing me. This printer is as good as gone for me.",74,17
Office_Products,B000VC7FTQ,2.0,negative,"The wireless setup worked like a charm. I was printing from my wireless laptop to my wireless printer in no time. But the honeymoon didn't last long. The printer cartridges ran out in no time. I thought maybe the one's that came with the unit were not as full of ink as the ones that I'd get from the store, so I didn't get to alarmed.

Well, I found out that the cartidges from the store were just like the one's from the printer box; very short on ink.

 Intially if you didn't know better you'd think that there was something wrong with the ink cartridges. But there's nothing wrong other than the typical manufacter ink scam, except even worse.

 If you print to any degree at all do not buy this printer.",133,18

Everything works as expected (although I have not used the faxing).
- Wireless (secured) is flawless, and a great feature if you move your laptop within the house.
- Copying and scanning work great for my needs (personal).
- My favorite feature: automatic double-sided printing.  Hard to find feature, and I have yet to see another company offer it at this price.  What a paper saver, now I don't feel as bad when printing.  You have to change its settings in XP in order to print both sides by default.
Also, I set the default to ""draft"" quality printing by default, which saves on ink.  I haven't had to replace the cartridges yet, and the quality is fine for personal use.
The only con I've found is that the automatic paper feed hasn't fed in the paper in the couple of times that I've tried.",190,20

I knew somewhere still had to be selling these things, so amazon i checked out, and sure enough, GEL PENS!! I bought the 48 pack of American Crafts Gel Pen Canister and absolutely LOVE them!!! For the past few days ive just been doodling away!! :) Very happy with this product! I have yet to try out every single pen and color, but the ones ive tried so far are great!!",148,36

All the old techniques to get the ink to flow with ballpoint pens when I was in school failed.  This assortment is proving to be a real ""dud"".  Nearly 25% of these pens do not work after the first use. I always recap my pens they really should not dry out. I can clearly see the volume of ink is in the inner tube.

A helpful neighbor recommeneded this product & we are AMAZED at how well it worked!!!
We sprayed about 12 hours before it rained; I seriously wish I had some 'before & after' shots...within just a few days, ALL of the weeds were gone from our yard!  It was AMAZING how fast it worked!  I mow the lawn weekly on the riding mower-I am the one that does all the yard care-I sprayed almost 2 months ago & there are STILL NO WEEDS!!  Also-I can tell exactly where I sprayed, because the grass in those spots is SO green, healthy & grows beautifully!!
This stuff is a no-brainer; it kills the weeds & fertilizes the ground so soft, lucious grass comes up quick.  GREAT stuff!!  I intend on buying it in bulk next spring-I LOVE it!!! =)",175,0
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,"When moving into our new house we didn't notice the lawn had not been kept up very well for most of the summer. The yard was full of dandelions and crabgrass. Fortunately this Ortho Weed-B-Gon is effective for killing dandelions and crabgrass. I sprayed each weed numerous times and used up one bottle on the entire lawn. It is killing the weeds and not the grass, except for the crabgrass. From the time I sprayed this weed killer on the weeds to the time they started to die was about three days. At first the plants looked wilted and then they started turning brown. I dug out all the big weeds once they started dying. This weed killer is great for when the weeds are still very young. It kills them fast and they just sort of disappear into the grass. The crabgrass seems to die a bit slower and probably needs more of this weed killer to do the trick. I'll be buying another bottle soon.

The blade trimmer worked very well cutting branches up to about one and a quarter inches, you really have to pull to cut them that big or larger but that's what kind of leverage you get with a 6"" lever arm, they're all like that.  The saw blade is pretty flimsy and trying to cut a 3"" branch at full extension is nearly impossible. The tool locked to full extension easily and held well.

The saw is pretty bad, so it's a bit of fight to saw off any reasonably sized branch.

After a few uses the hook snapped.  It is made out of really cheap metal.  You expect that in a fight between the metal hook and a branch, the metal hook should win, but not so with this pruner.

Overall, a waste of money, do not buy.  I had a bit better expectations of Fiskars, I will try the Corona pruner next (so far all the corona products I got seemed to work as expected).",115,16

You are not going to be able to take it out with you everyday to make a living or to cut down a 5"" diameter limb. But if you need something a couple times a year just to keep your property looking good, it's worth every penny of the $32.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the lock on the extension clamp. The clamp works great but you need a screw driver or pocket knife to pull the lock lever over a raised notch to loosen the clamp. I just don't like having to have a tool to operate another tool.

Several had poor welds or breaks in the wire.  One package had the three vertical supports secured at odd places leaving a huge gap on one side of the cage.  I would not recommend these.

All 4 of the supports continued to bend under the weight of my beefsteak tomato plants, despite being tied together at the top. My cherry tomato plants did not bend the cages, but probably didn't need the supports anyway. A few of the wires broke. It is possible I didn't have enough soil in my raised bed to support the buried wires. I will try again next spring after I straighten out the spokes and use framing wire to hold broken wires together.

They did the trick. I found it helpful to 1. Make sure soil is deep enough to cover legs to the first circle for strong ""base"".  2. Tie together upper circles of other tomato plants with string to provide more sturdy support. I found that without doing these two things the supports actually bent forward on my raised garden bed.",155,135

POSITIVES:

 Well made
 Large
 Study, but easy to bend and adjust
 Weather resistant

NEGATIVES:

 Expensive

These cages saw very heavy use and elemental exposure in my garden over the summer. They all worked well and all 10 are still in perfect condition, sitting outside and awaiting this years garden. Excellent purchase. The only downfall is the price point. These are great for individuals who are, for whatever reason, unable to procure tomato cages from their local garden supplier.",95,176

They're useable, at the moment, but if they've begun to fail already, I don't imagine they'll be staying in the garden for many seasons more. Keep looking for other cages. Maybe you'll find something that is a better long-term investment than these.",57,178

Save your money and buy bigger, better quality cages.",61,186
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,4.0,positive,"I initially got these for tomatoes. Being a first-time tomato grower at the time, I really didn't know any better thinking these small cages will be enough for tomato. Very soon, my tomatoes outgrew the cage and the plants started to bend the cages.

Now, I only use these to support smaller plants, like peppers and basils so the winds don't knock these plants down.

I do not advise getting these cages for tomatoes but great product and cheap price to support smaller plants.",84,187

I am not sure why everyone says they go through batteries, I have had my pot 1 year and just replaced the batteries for the first time. I turn it in almost every evening through the summer/fall while out on my porch. I added clear aquarium glass rocks to the bottom of my pot to give the base weight in the breeze and it has never tipped nor does it interfere with the color, actually it gives some pretty dynamics to the colors.

We homeschool a couple of our kids and they keep daily journals, including a section on the day's weather.  Their favorite part of their journal entries is donning their raincoats and rainboot for recording the rainfall.  They call the gauge the 'test tube,"" which is sort of what it looks like.

This looked nice enough so I thought I would try it out.
Well sadly this is just not that great.
One main issue is the stake it is on should really be one single piece to make it last longer.
However it is not one piece but you have to assemble it and hope that it will fit together.
Mine took a bit of work to get it to fit together right. This should not be the case with a new item.
As a result it actually did not even stay up the other day in a bit of wind and rain.
So I would say maybe not the best one to use. There are better ones out there.
It did make it during a couple rains before this last one and seems accurate.
Just did not last in the last wind we had it. Got knocked over where it connects together on the stake and cracked.
Maybe if it had fit right to begin with would not have happened or better yet if the stake was a single piece.
Not something I would suggest to anyone to get.",199,92

Attractive polystyrene cylinder holds up to five inches of rainfall and is scaled for both inches and centimeters. Shatter and crack resistant. A spiral circles the tube and adds to the look. A metal, adjustable stake holds the tube up to a height of 36 inches. I have mine in a large oak barrel planter on my back deck so is safe from being knocked over. I think, however, that placed in the ground at the 36-inch height, it might be vulnerable to being knocked over.

The poles are not sturdy, and tend to lean, no matter how far you push them into the earth/dirt.  Once a rain storm finally came along, the gauge blew off the plastic pole, rendering it useless.

Not just that it's 100% plastic but the black part is thin, flimsy, and has burrs on it from where it was injection-molded.

I'm now using this gauge's plastic tube in my original gauge.  I threw away the black part, so I can't report on whether it's even strong enough to stand upright.

I see that this tube will likely break soon too, but this entire  flimsy rain gauge cost less than half what my previous replacement tube cost, and that one broke in a few weeks.  Mystified that it's so difficult to buy a rain gauge that's attractive, not overpriced, and reasonably sturdy.",147,144

I have two young children who love checking the rainfall levels when it rains. The first one I bought was part of a thermometer and rain gauge set.  The thermometer was at the bottom and the rain gauge sat on top.  The problem was that the rain gauge was made out of glass. My 7 year old picked it up to look at the rainfall totals, accidentally dropped it, and it was ruined within the first week.  The Luster Leaf 1640 Rainfall Gauge is made out of plastic.

The holder is so flimsy that the rain catcher has a slight tilt.  The catcher is much too wide so that it fills up to the top with a good rainfall.  A near accurate reading is impossible.  My son knew I was looking for one and bought me one as a surprise.  His gauge will read an inch whereas the Luster Leaf (a few feet away) is almost overflowing.,102,220
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,"weak plastic and does not hold up well in a rain storm..
 needs to be of a heavier gauge post to hold it upright
I had to reinforce it with glue.. not your best choice for a rain gauge.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,1.0,negative,"I was a bit surprised at how weak the support stick is for the rain gauge.  Even with no rain in it, it doesn't stand straight.  It just waves in the wind.  As soon as rain hits it, it pretty much bends to the ground.  It also only holds 1.5 inches of rain.  Believe it or not, it rains more here than that every now and then and I can't measure it.  Heck, I couldn't measure it anyway because as soon as the rain starts to fill it, it bends over and loses most of the water!  Yes, this is a cheap product, but save your money and purchase something of quality.",112,225

I had another gauge that was of similar size but that one's highest marking was 5 inches.  I was ready to presume that the Luster Leaf gauge was incorrectly marked.  However before I registered a complaint, I decided to check with my neighbor who happens to be a meteorologist. He explained that the gauge was correctly marked.  The Luster Leaf gauge has flanges that angle out and because of the angle out edges it collects more rain than the gauges that have straight edges on the tube.  So even if it strikes you as being out of kilter, it will be accurate---if you believe a meteorologist.",127,229

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0019DBZF6,4.0,positive,"This is the first rain gauge I have ever owned and I find it fun to observe how much rain we received.  Although, it's made of plastic, I'm wondering how it will hold up to the outdoor elements. And if you will be able to read the gauge when the desired location is in the open and it gets alot of sunshine.  I wonder if the plastic cup will become hard to read in time. The stake is alittle flimsy, but I have mine pushed in the ground pretty deep, so it's not as tall, as on windy days, it tends to move with the wind.  I didn't realize how much rain an inch is, til I seen the gauge. I was alittle disappointed that it only registers 1.5 inches.  I guess that's alot of rain, and you can dump it out and add to the amount of rainfall you keep getting. I've made sure to bring it inside when it's calling for freezing temperatures at night.

I could have bought this at the Dollar Store, and got a better made product. ALSO, I cannot get it together.  It's very simple, just connect them, but it's so cheaply made, that it won't stay together.  Even with tape surrounding the connector joints, they won't stay.

This product does not work. It does not generate electricity.

Nobody wants to carry a 'brand new' 300lbs generator around to get it 'fixed'.
I don't either.
Apparently many of you will receive a generator that will not start.

After having repeated problems with ~4 gallons in - I added another 3 gallons of gas and it started right up.  I can't yet comment on its performance and reliability.

All things considered I purchased the Generac 10,000 watts portable.  Shipping was free and without issue.  Following the directions set up was easy enough, although battery installation required some effort and correct sockets, etc.  The generator started right up.  Turns out there was a brief power outage the following day that served as a dry run.  Sandy hit the following month.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,I have to admit this is a great way to hide a key. It is not unusual to see thermometers hanging around people's homes and it looks just like any other thermometer. It easily fits two keys (I only put one in there) and it snaps right together. The only problem I had with it was the hooks inside the box were too large for a key. It looked like the excess plastic from the mold had not been trimmed off. I had to pull out my razor blade and whittle the hooks down to a usable size.,98,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,2.0,negative,Not a real thermometer.  Flimsy plastic which is now breaking after several uses.,13,56

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,1.0,negative,Very cheap plastic and hard to slide the front up to get the key out. Even the package it was in was very cheap. Made in China and you can tell by the quality. You get what you pay for here. Cheap price equal cheaply made product.,47,59

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,"This has been the perfect little hiding spot for a spare key. I never liked the looks of the fake rocks, they always look too plastic. This blends well and looks like it's been there for ages. It's easy for even my youngest to slide open and perfect for when my teenager forgets his keys. It's even saved my husband and I a time or two! Easy to screw in (nails or screws not included) and hides two keys safely inside. The thermometer has been surprisingly accurate, given the wonky weather we've been experiencing in New York lately, lol. Would definitely purchase this again. It was a great deal for the price, too.",113,82

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,4.0,positive,"I find this hard to slide open, and I'm a little concerned it will break with too much use.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B002AQ69ZW,5.0,positive,Looks great where I have it. Love that it works too!! None even notices that it's there. I live in a complex so the fake rocks and sprinkler heads really wouldn't work for me with the maintenance crews and whatnot so this is the perfect solution!,46,102

It's made out of very cheap plastic and it looks inconspicuous from afar, but if someone were really looking to break into my house I feel like they could tell this was a hide a key and would be able to just let themselves in.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0042L21B4,4.0,positive,"Pros:
1. Has a hanging loop.
2. Reads temperature accurately enough; room temp within 1 degree, boiling water within 4 degrees.
3. Highest temperature is reached fast and according to specs, in 15 to 20 seconds.
4. Has stainless steel tynes.
5. Auto feature works.
Cons:
1. Backlit light does not remain on; will require a flashlight to see temperature when cooking at barbecue..
2. Auto feature is too difficult to use because backlight is off, fork does not beep, and backlight does not flash when target temp is reached. Instead you must look for a tiny arrow to flash.
Comment
This is a state-of-the-art device. Unfortunately, the autofeature does not work as stated in the directions rendering it useless. In spite of this, the fork serves my needs, being sure fish and poultry have cooked to a safe temp. I do not need the auto features. Therefore,  I give the fork a 4/5 because backlit light does not remain on.and because beep feature does not work.",167,2

Everytime I've tried, at least one or two crickets would escape.... until we bought another product called Lee's Kricket Keeper. The Kricket Keeper comes with 4 tubes that the crickets naturally want to hide in so when you pull a tube out, you can get a lot of crickets at once. We now just use the tube to fill the cricket feeder then quickly close the rock. Then we place the rock in the terranium, unplug the hole, and our BD will basically sit in front of the opening and grabs each cricket as soon as it approaches the opening.",132,7
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"I like the idea behind this feeder.  It feels substantial.  It looks good.  But it has significant flaws.  The stopper doesn't fit, and requires modification to make it useful.  Probably best to just get an appropriately sized rubber stopper at the hardware store.  But the biggest problem is that it does not have a means to lock it closed.  This may not matter too much with smaller lizards, but our full size adult bearded dragon figured out where the crickets were the first time it was used.  Why sit there wondering if there are more crickets when you're a dragon?  Just shove the rock until it splits and then you get all the crickets at once.  (Never mind that calcium and vitamin dust go everywhere in the process).  So while refrigerated crickets are easy to load into an opened cricket rock, warmed up crickets are even easier to get out (if you're a dragon) by kicking the rock open.

Add a reliable locking mechanism and a stopper the fits and I'll be a customer for life.  Otherwise, buy with caution.",180,8

Every morning we place 3-5 large/small crickets inside  (covering the peep whole every time we fish out crickets from their storage container).  After turning the rock carefully upside down and shaking the rock side to side in a gentle manner, they get fully coated with the calcium.  The crickets play inside for a short bit while getting coated with the calcium powder. The goastly looking crickets come out fully white playing peek-a-book for a short bit (while the dragon eyes the whole patiently waiting for its future meal to pop out.

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"I purchased this item thinking that it would make it easier to feed my baby beardies but it definitely made it harder. Usually I purchase about 200 crickets and keep them alive by giving them the orange cubes, but for whatever reason they started dying quicker. The very first time I used this to powder the crickets, my beardies were so happy. It was like a buffet. The only issue is getting the crickets IN and not WASTING them. The crickets were jumping out as I was putting them in, the used this to climb on top of to jump out of the beardies cage, and when I opened it to change the powder out half of the crickets were dead inside though i had only put in a few at a time. I guess for someone more experienced with this item, it could work how it is intended but for me it made a huge mess of powder and dead crickets. I wouldn't recommend it at all.",168,18

Plug fits horribly and does not hold them in nor do i think it would hold the dragon out from getting in. In my opinion its made upside down as you have to keep the lid (which has the logo, trademark and writing facing upwards) on the top or any movement and you spill all the crickets out.

Anyways put all 12 in, let a few escape, he ate and then i put plug back in.  Went back 2 hours later and all crickets are stone dead inside. Do not leave the crickets in like others have said in their reviews. Waste of money and time to us.",119,21

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"I bought this on a whim, and I have to say, I am pretty pleased with this purchase. It gets the crickets perfectly dusted, and it helps control the flow of the crickets coming out. My dragon sucks at hunting, so this was ideal for him. If I dropped them in all at once he would lose interest and not eat them, but some days I wouldn't have time to individually feed him until he was done.

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"First off, you will need a cricket funnel scoop, Rainbowmealworms has them for 7.50, linked below.

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,This is totally worthless. First the bottom does not hold on to the rest of the feeder. When you go to pick up the feeder you must hold on to the bottom or you will have all the crickets that are left going free. Second how do you get the crickets into the feeder?

By my estimate, having paid around $15 for the thing, this is a $60/hour toy, as you would need four of them to last a full hour.

As an aside, I'm a little annoyed at the fancy ""boutique"" pet shop that sold it to me. It's one thing if I picked it up at Kmart or some other discount store where I would never expect the person who rings up the sale to alert me to the fact that I was buying a piece of crap...but in this case, I think it's incumbent upon the owner/operator who actually asked me what kind of dog we had, to be candid about just how delicate this item is.

I wasn't paying much attention and he chewed the end of the tongue off in less than 60 seconds.  So it does not hold up in any way against a chewer, so I moved it to an outside toy.

However, according to my husband, it is not very easy to install and remove and takes some time so ours remains in my car all the time, which I'm not very excited about.",102,53

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,"Subaru Forrester with sunroof.

When the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down.  They like to take turns leaning on the center console and  would slide forward when stopping.  She sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the Giant and he tries to escape to the front.  Not good, nor safe.

The metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof, they would hit the glass of sunroof.  Those  seem to be semi-permanent.  Whether that is because take up to much room to store, or to hard to install and remove I do not know.  All don't buy decision makers for me.

When I discovered Kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs, IT DOES!

Easy to install and remove, even folds and slides back into storage bag easily.

Dogs were happy they could still look over headrests and we're all riding safer.

We're happy and have already recommended to someone in the parking lot!",162,59

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,"The Kurgo Backseat Pet Barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound, very enthusiastic Portuguese Water Dog out of the front seat.  This was critical to me, because my car, a Saab, has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats, and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as I was driving--a rather unnerving experience.

As soon as she saw the barrier, my dog didn't even try to wiggle through.  It sent a clear message, and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet.

The barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat, while simultaneously barring access to the front seat.  One caveat--the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror, so I'm planning to remove it. (It unfastens easily.) This product is a great value and will probably last a very long time, owing to its sturdy construction and strong materials.  I've owned it for about a month, and couldn't be happier.",182,65

my only complaint is the installation.  it was a pain and difficult to understand and i'm not sure if it's installed correctly.  instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat.  other then that, it's not as tall as i had expected/hoped.  my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive, but at least he's contained to the back seat.",145,67

Disappointed in this purchase.,70,107

It has rubber nibs on the inside and outside of the arch to rub against, but so far no activity. We're still hopeful that in time one of them will give it a try.

She loves to sharpen her claws on it, and occasionally I clean a clump of hair off it. That's one less clump I have to brush, so I consider it money well spent.

This thing, except for the pom pom, is still going strong! The pom pom has been annihilated, as seen in the photo, but the cat still digs it. Whatever makes her happy.",118,133

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,"We recently bought a Papillion puppy, and she's so tiny I was having trouble finding a harness to fit her. The smallest dog harness I could find was for a full-grown toy dog, so at the moment she can simply walk through it. I was complaining to friends when one suggested searching for a rabbit or ferret harness and that led me here.

This fit our puppy perfectly, and though she pulled hard to twist around in an attempt to chew on the leash (and managed to reach it, too!) it didn't unfasten. I confess I removed the little bell (as I fear it may have been alarming her) but even that was an easy process. The vest which arrived was a lime green, almost yellow. Very cute.

I would definitely buy this harness again.",135,4

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,Purchased for my Netherland Dwarf rabbit who is only 2.7 lbs. Based on reviews I got the small. However this was way too small and didn't come close to fitting under his belly. Right after removing it from the package the nylon frayed and the belt clip fell off because there was nothing at the end of the nylon to hold it on. The rest of the harness seemed ok.

Nope, it was WAY too small and I had to return it. I'm debating about trying a size Large or X-large because I know my daughter would like it (I'm not so sure if the pig would actually like it though). It looks to be well made and soft, but I gave it low stars because of the misrepresented size.

I have purchased a number of these vests to help with kitten and cat training and the tabs that go around the body of the animal were always soft so as not to irritate.  That is not the case with the extra large size - the tabs are too short and the Velcro is very stiff and is squared off and will irritate the animal as it moves.  I am going to see if I can fix this as the soft mesh material is wonderful.  I'm glad I didn't buy more.  Returning it would have been a hassle. Too bad.,110,188

Its still a bit tight so I wouldn't get this for an animal any larger than 6lb.

Hopefully that won't be the case of me loosing him,70,218
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,I love the idea but the way this thing is designed puts the front of the harness around the animals neck. In order for them to not slip out it needs to be a little tighter too. Felt like I was choking my animal. I wouldn't recommend this design.,49,219
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,"The company that shipped the product was professional and cared a lot about customer service. The product itself was well made, and it did its job well enough. My problem is with how it was designed. The product is supposedly designed to fit both ferrets and rabbits, but I found it to fit my rabbit very uncomfortably.

I had the adjustable neck strap as tight as i could get it, while I had the adjustable torso strap as loose as I could have it. It was still too tight around my rabbit's torso and loose enough around her neck that she was able to squeeze out of it a little at one point. I think it leans a little towards fitting ferrets, rather than a rabbit. I thought that the adjustable strap would make it possible for my rabbit to grow into a little bit, but she completely grew out of it in a week because of how tight the torso strap was to begin with.

If you have a ferret, it is probably a great fit. With rabbits, I suggest waiting until they reach their full maturity before getting one.",191,220

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,"I bought this for a small female Lionhead rabbit (whos always naturally been very slender).  Shes small for an adult female, even her dewlap is smaller than a typical female rabbit.  I went to the petstore and looked at the ""large"" size.  Its too small for a rabbit (unless you have a very small breed).  Even the XL would be too tight on a larger breed.  If you want one for a larger/heavier rabbit, I recommend looking elsewhere OR simply sew on more Velcro to the straps (it works great and still keeps them secure!).

For my rabbit though, this is a great harness!  The material seems strong and has a little stretch in it for comfort.  I was worried about the neckline, but she didn't have a problem with it.  It didn't constrict her.  The slip around strap on the neckline gives me added security.  She hopped around quite happily.  The leash is short though (just pick up a longer one at the petstore or the dollar store).  I cant imagine her being able to slip out of this harness.  I couldn't beat the price or the quality.

If you have a large breed you may want to consider buying it in person at a store for easy return if it doesn't fit.  It does run very small.  But it is a very nice harness.  Fairly easy to put on and he seems comfortable in it.  He has never managed to escape from it, but is a very calm bunny and doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  The leash isn't that long, but I feel like that gives me more control of the rabbit, though don't expect to be able to walk a bunny like you would a dog.

I have a mini rex, which is like a medium sized rabbit so It's good that it's adjustable, and it seems to be comfy for him.

It is too lightweight for that & will tip over---BUT my cats love it & we just keep it tipped over! They stand on it, lay on it or over it & hide things under it. They wrestle with it & scratch their chins on the edges of the bottom piece.  They love it & laying flat there is no problem with them scratching the heck out of it.  So it may not appear to be as sturdy as a wooden stand up post, but if you are creative (actually the cats tipped it the way they wanted it) & just tip it on its side, it works great.  I would buy another. The carpet is a very tight knit indoor-outdoor type carpet & does not fray like the stand up rug posts. My cats do not like the sisal rope scratchers so we are left with the rug posts that fray & they destroy or something like this.",181,6

Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,This post is great for cats who like to scratch the carpet or furniture with the heavy upholstered weave. It's not for all. I have sisal rope post that cost 75$. The best quality made and my cat barely touches it. He loves this one. It is not heavy and is best wedged between something or under something so it gives them a sturdy hold when they scratch. I love the raised curved edge as I prop it beneath a chair and it's the perfect length so it fits secure and my cat can stand lengthwise if he pleases on all 4's to scratch. My cat is 17 lbs mostly muscle and has not encountered any issues pulling it out of place when it's secure in that fashion.,128,11

Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,"Awesome stuff, it stopped my puppy from chewing on the molding around the floor (knawing off our paint and huge chips of wood), our wooden chairs, and anything else we didn't want her destroying. I also recommend telling them 'no, that's not your toy', and then giving them one of they're toys that they're allowed to chew on and say 'chew on your toy' to help redirect that behavior. It's natural for dogs and especially teething puppies to want to chew on things and they need to have something they can chew on, but this spray really helps to let them know what they can't touch. It's really powerful stuff, definitely hold your breath when spraying it (a mask would probably be better) because if you breathe it in while it's airborne it will linger in your mouth and it tastes HORRIBLE!!",142,6

Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,"Alright so I tried this on two of my pets - a shih tzu and a miniature pig. I mainly bought it for the pig as there was a spot of carpet she had been picking at lately and I wanted to discourage it before it became a problem.

Well, this stuff arrived and I figured I should test how good it is - or rather how bad it tastes? Both pets generally take anything from my hand that I offer and then spit it out if they don't like it so for my test I tried a plain old scrap of paper. Sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu. He ate it and then asked for more. Then did this with the pig as well. Same result. They both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was I going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff. I repeated the process once more to be sure. I then put some on my finger and they both licked it clean.

Outside, they tend to slide around until the tread is on the top.

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,"Don't let the name fool you! These are not meals but an odd assortment of snacks. Some of these products were good, but others just had a strange taste in the name of extra protein. The taste is not worth how much you are paying for these.",47,18

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"I had field training & sometimes used these in place of my MREs. I love the variety of flavors. The small packets kept me full longer and that was surprising. They taste great! Plus, you can take them as a snack when traveling. Great product!",45,21
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,I ordered these as kind of a grab-and-go snack for work or if I forgot to eat breakfast. The majority of them are good the white cheese crisps and the chili cheese crisps are extremely good the rest are decent I've seen a lot of people complain about the price but the same box on the Kay's natural website cost $10 more so the price here is awesome will be ordering again,72,22
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"I've bought these a few times!  Most of the packages are great although there's one or two that are ""duds"" but I'll still eat even those.  Great source of a snack and a protein yum yum.  I'll purchase it again too!",41,23

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews on these products.  Bought this variety package to try Kay's Naturals products and I have liked all of them.  I never get enough protein and love snack food, and am always on the go- so these products are perfect for me!",50,27
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"I haven't tried all the flavors, but about half of them so far are edible to me. They're not as good as my favorite medifast options (optavia, tsfl-berry crunch cereal, smores bars, honey mustard pretzels) but at half the price this was a good exploratory purchase to find things I like in a lower price range. I learned as a health coach that when it comes to meal replacement food like this, people's tastes are wildly different, so if you're looking for something cheaper than medifast, this is a great exploratory option. I won't be buying this particular package again, but have already started ordering the options I like in bulk separately. This actually has many more options that satisfy my sweet tooth, which I found to be a pleasant surprise!",131,28
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,"I would rate these 0 stars if I could. I tried each type and they are all flavorless, the texture is horrible even for gluten-free. I honestly think I'd choose hunger over eating these.",34,29
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,"I tried. I really did. These are hideous. My newly college graduated nephew thought they were terrible too, but as a broke youngun' he took them off my hands!! I really wanted to like these so that I could have a healthy boost of protein to manage my blood sugar and stay slim, but they really are unbearable - I'd rather eat nothing or a rice cake.",67,30
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,These al taste pretty good for healthy snacks.,8,31
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,Some of the flavors were all right and filling. Some of the flavors have that fake sugar substitute in them and I am allergic to that. Oh well.,28,32

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,I thought they tasted good. But I did not realize it is soy protein.,14,40
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"This is definitely not meant to be your standard snack, it is a health food and should be expected to taste like one. Personally, I've enjoyed a lot of the flavors they offer. Some of them leave a funny taste in your mouth, but the same could be said for protein shakes.

These snacks are tasty, healthy, and at a reasonable price so I will be happily buying them again.",70,41
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,"A real waste of my money.  Boring, very little flavor",10,42
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"This product is going to help me out so much. I bought the box just to use the individual treats as snacks while at work but after reading the insert I am going to order again and begin the program. I cannot stand ultra sweet or super salty snacks so I avoid chips, cookies, crackers, etc. When I searched for healthy snacks and saw that these were not your average junk food, I bought them to try out. I will say that the odd texture on some isn't surprising considering they're gluten free. Other than that, I have nothing but good words for the flavors. When you create the meals by adding fresh fruits and vegetables, yogurt, and the other suggested products, you will save yourself calories, control your portions, and ultimately feel better.",134,43
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,I loved a few of the flavors and some did not care for as much. It's great for me to throw in my bag for a healthy snack that's high protein.,31,44
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,These taste like you overcooked a loaf of bread and threw some seasoning on the rock hard stone you call food. The taste is horrible and all of them taste the same no matter the seasoning or flavor.,38,45
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,"I ordered these because I was looking for a gluten-free, high protein snack to keep with me at the office and in my car because I'm on the road a lot!  I would not order these again for any amount of money.  They taste like cardboard and my 7 year old granddaughter and grandson would not even eat them.  They are not worth the money at all.",67,46
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"If I was smarter, I'd leave a bad review so they stay in stock and reduce price.",17,47
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"After reading some bad reviews I'm confident about leaving mine because I don't want them to stop producing those. It is true not every single taste can be your favorite, but it is so personal. What I loved - my husband didn't and other way around. But the idea of crunchy snack that is full of proteins not fat and sugar and does not cost $5 per ounce. I'm not on any sort of diet, but I am on the run. And for me one of those bags plus an apple is a perfect lunch option.
Advice - get this box, try what's inside and then buy only flavors you like. Amazon sells them individually in packs of 6.
P.S. I'm lactose intolerant for last 9 years and because of those I can enjoy flavors like Mac And Cheese, pizza or cheddar sticks again))))))",144,48
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"Every single 1 of these pack are absolutely delicious. I didn't buy it for the weight loss benefit, although that's a definite advantage, I was looking for a gluten free something that tasted like real food, and I certainly did find it!!",42,49
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,My kids did not enjoy eating these. I was hoping for a healthier gluten free snack for them to take to lunch.,22,50
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,"Bought these in the hopes of having something nutritious around for the family to snack on, but this company has not been at all successful in getting pea protein to taste decent. The snacks do fill you up and are better for you than potato chips or something, so we we're able to get through about half the box, but the rest we just had to dump as we couldn't get past the taste.",74,51
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,My husband and kids HATED these. I was okay with them...until halfway through the bag. It started tasting gummy.,19,52
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"Useful when I forget to eat but some of the flavors are a bit weird.  Of course I don't ever buy regular snack foods with bbq and other flavors.  Never liked them.  I wish I could hand pick what goes in the box.  The cookie and cinnamon and parmesan flavors are my favs, Cheeses without extra flavorings stuck in are my other favorites. Being a gastric bypass patient and celiac, these are very useful.",74,53
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,Bought these for my Gluten Free wife and she loves them.,11,54

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"I was surprised to see low stars.  I thought they were great, but I've been gluten free for over 6 years.  For the cost, convenience, nutrition, AND being gf I think they deserve 5 stars.",35,56
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,Most of the items tasted stale to me. I have had better gluten free products. I did like the chili and  one other.,23,57
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"This is a great way to determine what flavors you like best. I love the cereals and the cheese flavored items. Some of the other flavors are not my favorite but even my 8 year old nephew (who is very picky) ate the cereal without complaint. This is a much more nutritious option that most cereals or chips out there. I also love the portion control because of the small bags. I have to make myself only eat one, but these are perfect for the office or school lunch bag.",90,58
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"These were for my college aged daughter to take to her classes and be able to eat a quick snack in between classes, keep her energy up, and be able to slide into her back pack easily before leaving home. She tries to eat healthy due to an autoimmune disease , so products that are made more naturally are a must for her. So glad there are products like this out there to choose from.",75,59

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,2.0,negative,I did not realize this was part of a diet program - it seems to be some sort of lose weight in a few weeks thing and that said - it might be fine for it's intended purpose. But I just wanted a high protein snack to replace the chips and cookies I love but don't need. I wanted to like them - I tried - and they are NOT flavorless like some reviews said - they have plenty of flavor but the flavor is awful! Truly. And if you can get past the awful flavor you have to deal with the chalky / gritty texture. I give them two stars for a great idea - but they failed in every other way. Sorry Kay's Naturals.,126,61
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"Filled me up better than your average snack. I keep these in my classroom cupboard for days when I don't have time for lunch. The high protein content leaves me feeling much fuller than your typical snack. If people have not eaten gluten free foods before then the texture might seem odd, but I liked all the ones I have tried so far. The flavors aren't as powerful as snacks you are used to, but I find typical flavored snacks to be overly flavored. So again, I liked them. I have tried about 5 of the items so far.",99,62
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,Nasty tasteless. Ugh. I'll never buy this again.,8,63
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,4.0,positive,"My husband needed protein on the go & this fit the bill.  As others have described, some bags are amazing & others are not.  If I could give 3.5 stars I would because it sucks to spend the money & have 75% be great, but it is as described so 4 will do.",53,64
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,Good stuff. Flavors and variety consistent. My coworkers stopped with the hating after they seent me looking and feeling better after having these instead of the usual go to junk snacks that we are tempted with. #BEEFCAKE #BEASTMODE,38,65
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"If someone complains about the flavor of these snacks, they have ridiculous expectations. These are low calorie high protein snacks, and some of the best I have ever tried.",29,66
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"They all taste pretty good.  Having Celiac Disease, its frustrating finding  gluten free snacks that taste good AND are not made solely of corn. The price is pretty reasonable as well. Am going to buy again, definitely!!",37,67
Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,1.0,negative,I know the dates on the packages states they are not expired. But MANY of them tastes very old. Like they have been in a cabinet for 1000 years. I understand the bland taste.. but many tasted OLD. Veggie puffs and Mac N Cheese puffs along with the cereal were good but the rest are gross. Threw out many of them.,61,68

Prime_Pantry,B00OKKMHIO,5.0,positive,"I'm a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (gastric surgery) patient and I'm always looking for good sources of protein and Kay's Natures has a lot of products that really suit my needs.

I would highly recommend the assortment so you can find the products that meet your taste requirements. I couldn't live without the ""puffs"" and ""cookie bites"". I love the portability and the portion control, not to mention the flavor. So, so much better than a lot of protein products that just taste like compressed cardboard. All these products have a good texture and flavor.

This assortment will save you money in the long run. Instead of having to buy a case of something you don't know if you're going to like you can try it in the assortment. I can almost guarantee there will be something you love and want to purchase a case of.",145,80

Prime_Pantry,B00QJGVF4Y,4.0,positive,"I bought these in a weak moment, telling myself I would only eat 3 (half the serving) each day.  Turns out, I can't do it.  They are so good I had eaten all 6 of them before I knew it.  BAM!  420 calories, 10g of Saturated fat & 18g of FAT in total.  I really can't figure out how Hostess can cram *that many calories* into these little donuts.  I mean, they are really dry inside so it doesn't seem possible they could have so much fat!  I have to believe it, surely Hostess wouldn't label them to say they have way more calories than they actually do.  So, like the Muddy Buddy snacks (that didn't taste all that great), I am currently handing them out to the trick-or-treaters.  The younger children aren't selecting these, but the bigger ones (age 7 & up) are.  There are only a couple of packs left and I will be glad when this temptation is out of my house.  For taste, I would give them 5 stars.  But I had to remove one because nutritionally they don't earn even one star.",187,1

I have tried competitor's ""crunch"" donuts, and I haven't found any that I remotely like.  For me this is ""the"" snack donut that I can't live without.  It's not just me.  The whole family love these donuts.  If you want to bribe me with something, then look no further.

If you are a fan of any of the competitor's crunch snack donuts and you haven't given the Hostess crunch donuts a shot, I highly recommend that you give them a try.",102,3

Be warned, if you live alone buying these in bulk may be dangerous.",73,8

So instead of getting 360 donettes (6 boxes x 10 packages/box x 6 per package), you really only get 60 donettes (1 x 10 x 6).

These are nice alternatives.  I can keep them in my desk drawer and eat them when the mood strikes.  It tastes fine and will tide me over.  Is it a super filling, 5 star gourmet meal... no.  But it isn't meant to be.  The ingredient list is better than a cup-o-noodles, and while anything like this has a lot of sodium, they aren't complete calorie bombs.

I will order these again.",129,6

This food is almost as one would expect it, similar in noodle and sauce texture to that of chef boyardee or spaghetti-o's.

However the sauce doesn't taste quite similar outside of the slightly sweet, which seems to have become the norm even with the jarred sauce.

As far as satiation it does a fairly decent job for a couple hours, but should be eaten with something else as well lest hunger strike again quickly.

I do plan on purchasing more of these in the future.

If you look at the image of the chicken, add the slightly rubber feeling of all dried jerkys, then imagine a swish of soy sauce and a hint of garlic added in, then you pretty much have this down...

The packet says it's made with sea salt, but i'll be honest, I've eaten sea salt for the last 5 years, and know its taste well, and I can not taste it in this product.

I give it a robust 6/10 in flavor. It could benefit from some other elements added in... A bit bland...
I give the packaging / display a 9/10.  It is a bit standard, but it works great! There's even a cute little window in the back for you to view the product. I guess they sell this in stores elsewhere in the country, but I sure haven't seen it.
The bag seal is a firm 10/10 with no leaks.

I just couldn't use it because it is so ridiculous. It doesn't even make sense. It might just be better to get Rosetta Stone... But RS costs like 500 dollars. You pay for what you get I guess.

It also never really ""Immerses"" you in Spanish. Even if you were to ignore the interface it is still a very poor learning experience.

For those of us who did not learn rudimentary Spanish in school, this is a great product. I come from a Spanish background never learning the language.

Instant Immersion is not immersion, it's mostly memorization (more so than Rosetta Stone). This is not a product you could really learn the language from. I'd say it's best use is for a student in a low level Spanish class to get a little more practice.

Also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp. for instance ""azul"" becomes ""athththul"" or ""azcar"" becomes ""ah-ffffu-cah"".

Perhaps that's worth the money, but don't confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from Rosetta Stone.  My problem with RS is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary.  So in that sense, this would be a nice complement to RS.  The audio CD's included in this are actual lessons, thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing.  It's really not comparable to RS at all, and any comparison is incredibly unfair.  They should take those claims off of their packaging.

I am a Spanish and ESL teacher. I have used both programs. Rosetta Stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face. You will be fluent in any language after using Rosetta Stone.

However, this ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" program does not use immersion. It teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other. You can quickly progress through the CDs without learning any grammar. How can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences?

Well after you waist $40.00 on this product and try ROSETTA STONE you'll find out what I am talking about.

Level 1 in Rosetta Stone will teach you more about the Spanish language than a few CD's in this cheep program. Why do I need 3 CD's to teach me the numbers 1 through 20? That's rediculous! Not even my four year old is interested in the program.

* It is easy to use.
* There is not much guidance about how to use it, but not much would be necessary. (Since you are being ""immersed,"" it's the same as if you were simply left in a Spanish-speaking country, and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the CD's from level to level.)
* It does keep track of your progress as you learn, thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at Spanish.
* For the price, it is an excellent program.

Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,"Before you can learn any language, you have to know the names of things.  That is the key.  This CD-set understands that and challenges you, in a game-show fashion, to play along with the game and gain points in order to progress, to advance to the next level.  After all, you can't learn to conjugate verbs or understand the ""gender value"" (mostly foreign to native English speakers) attributed to the nouns and their relative verb conjugations if you have never heard the nouns before.  It is a very complicated thing, Russian and Ukrainian.  If it came in a pill, everyone could take one!  Too many courses go way too fast by talking about the possessive of a certain female pronoun adjective (huh?)- but this one is just the right speed- slow and simple.  Sure, it could have utilized more sophisticated graphics but remember, when you're a ""kid"" in a language, you have to be treated like one.  And being a kid again is actually quite fun!",166,5
Software,B00005RIQ5,2.0,negative,"If you want to learn to speak Russian, this CD will not help you very much.  It does help you learn some random words and gives you a feel for Russian, but that is about it.
HOWEVER, the CD's format does allow you to learn numbers, time and dates fairly well and then tests you on them in an effective manor.  If you feel you are weak in numbers, time and dates, then it is worth the cost to learn them.  I found that I'm very fast at numbers as a result of this course.  By itself, the course doesn't do much, but for the specific area of numbers and time, I can't think of a better way to learn.
It is also a nice way to expose childern to a new language.  It is fairly easy to pick up the words in the games and childern seem to enjoy these types of games.",154,6

The first CD teaches you colors, numbers, time, the alphabet and so on but it doesn't help with actually communicating with the people.
Though I agree that it is a five star product for teaching children with the colorful games and basic words.
And Three stars for tourists who want just to get around with basic words, but to learn the actually language I find that it is impossible to.
This is also a nice way just to review but it is limited by only it's basic words.

It's basically a game that you have NO way of winning or even doing well at unless you're relatively schooled in Russian.  The one thing that this product did come in handy with was helping me to at least hear spoken Russian from native speakers while I worked my way thorough Nicholas J. Brown's ""The New Penguin Russian Course,"" which you should redirect your search engine to right now if you're looking to this product to help you actually learn Russian language - it's the best of the best.

The animation, music and sound are first rate, but more importantly, the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler.  This program stacks up well against the Knowledge Adventure titles like Reader Rabbit.  Skills such as sequencing, color matching, memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments.  Plus, there are three difficulty levels, so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level, you can adjust accordingly.

Oh, and if that's not bad enough, when you want to send an invoice by email, it doesn't use the invoice template you've created.  Instead it generates an uncustomizable email in plain text which looks like something from the early days of punch card computers.  Also, remember those customer accounts you created in Money?  Well the invoice doesn't pull in the customer information!  That's right, you have to use a different form to enter the customer billing information (again) for invoices.  Terrible product.

This piece is not updatable as is every map from Garmin.
Garmin's software (both MapSource and BaseCamp) is quite low quality and usability. It is slow and ugly if you care.
Don't expect much support from Garmin.

If you can - use Google map if you have to use Garmin - set you expectation to extremely low level. I did but I am still annoyed.

You cannot use ANY other mapping software/product with the Garmin GPS. For the $129.95 PLUS tax, shipping and handling I think I have a reasonable expectation the Garmin TOPO would be accurate.  It is not.  My other complaint with the TOPO software is there are no instructions on use.  I guess the TOPO engineers expect new users to be intuitive or just learn by trial and error.

Also firmware update for Etrex and 60CSX allowing a 4 gig card, not quite enough capacity for CA NA OR WA 24K. I made a special card part City Navigator NT part Topo 24k. City Navigator NT disables elevation lines when active.  California is two map files on NT (from map, hit menu, select setup map, check or uncheck NT map for your city needs).

Around Santa Cruz, all of the trails that make up the Skyline to the Sea trail are missing.  These are major, heavily used trails and having incomplete trail information really limits the functionality of the maps and the GPS unit for hikers.

Also, in Washington State near Shelton there is a campground known as Brown Creek. It shows this as being in the National Park! It is not! It is in the National Forest..

Even on the Vista, the contours are such that I can use them for ""bushwacking"" if necessary.  I compared this to the free one that a lot of people use and there is no comparision.

Sure you can look around online for free, compatible, download-able maps from online sources but I found I couldn't always get the coverage I needed from free maps.  Simply put, if you're going to be using your GPSr for anything outdoorsy, on the ground, in the western states of Washington Oregon, California or Nevada just suck it up and get these 24K TOPO maps.  Not the 50k:1 or 100k:1 ... Get the standard of the realm 24k:1 TOPO maps.  Then learn to actually READ a TOPO map if you don't know how.

Garmin provides two, free to download, guides for using a GPSr.  One specifically covers using your GPSr in conjunction with a paper TOPO map.

Go to farm road CO123 (12 miles).

Continental Divide Trail, Rainbow trail, Colorado trail not shown. A lot of garbage that an outdoorsman doesn't need. Who needs to know where shopping centers or an ATM are when hunting or as Garmin puts it, ON THE TRAIL? The reason for the purchase was to put a copy on my etrex Legend HCX and I wanted to print maps from my PC. Well I tried printing a map to an HP laserjet printer and it printed the Navteq logo over the map. I tried to a second printer, an HP inkjet, same thing.  After an hour on hold with technical support, the technician told me Garmin is aware of the problem and I should do a print screen. Well the same thing printed. I logged into my Amazon account and sent it back.",189,41

Having said that, it is -ridiculous- that you have to pay so much to get these maps. I got the Southwest maps because that's where I live and do most of my hiking. But I'm taking a trip to backpack in Montana soon, and it just isn't worth it to buy the separate map DVD for that trip. If these things were cheaper, I would've.

Amazon's price is much better than most others, but still very high compared to maps for GPS units from other manufacturers. I guess it's cheaper than buying lots of paper maps, but you have to do that anyway because you're crazy if you rely only on your GPS when you're in a place where navigation is a serious concern.",167,42

TuneUp is amazing for making your music library more presentable, which is great for iOS devices, because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better.

With a GPS puck (not included), MS MapPoint becomes a great GPS for salesmen, delivery men, and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner.  Most GPS devices fail in this regard (they work great from point A to B, and could include a detour, but forget about going to ten locations).  It would be great if MS had a self-contained GPS device (not a laptop) which could be programed with the information generated from MapPoint (by using a PC as the user interface, it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen).

We do not need the wayfinding function, so having that is of no value.

The improvements on MapPoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor. Pushpin management has been overhauled, and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from. Map Settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation. Also, you are now able to import / export .gpx files, making for easier data sharing. If you need new features like these then by all means, I would recommend purchasing MapPoint 2010.

What worries me considerably is that Microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application - Bing Maps. This application is only available direct from Microsoft, and the cost varies with the number of seats you license.

That makes me wonder how long MapPoint will be available, and whether Bing Maps will be a better program.

Software,B004DLCQZ4,5.0,positive,"Save yourself some money and use this older version of Willmaker. The laws simply do not change significantly enough to make any difference. Your will will certainly be valid using this. Ignore the ""no longer supported"" messages from Quicken, the key thing is legal validity, and for that, this product works fine.",52,22

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,Instant Immersion Spanish is a hit for our family.  I was looking for something for my kids ages 4-7 that could be used for independent study.  I don't know any Spanish and this software is a perfect starting point for us.  The games are fun and even my 4 year old can play all by herself.  I love the speech practice where it records your voice then plays it back in a word by word comparison with the word spoken correctly.  The kids are working hard to earn enough points to print out an award.  For other great early ed product reviews and family posts visit,106,0
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"For someone who already speaks some Spanish and wants to move to the next step, this is a great way to do it.  Easy and fun to use. Great set of audios to use while driving, working out or other free time activities.  It worked for me.",47,1
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"The worst product I have ever bought from Amazon. I do not recommend it to anybody. If you have $30 to waste, then you will have more fun burning it than spending on Instant Immersion software. The software looks like it was designed 15 years ago and the jerks at Instant Immersion have not updated it in 15 years. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. I tried to install it on my MAC and the stupid thing does not install like most other softwares. The instructions are pathetic. I wish the bozo's at Amazon would not sell this product. I hate it and has setback my learning by several months.",109,2
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"Old software, runs very slowly on my new computer although all the specs say it is compatible.

I got bored but if you are new to spanish or want to teach your young children it is a great tool.",60,3
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"The program is supposed to work with Vista, but does not.  After many failed attempts to install, making sure sound drivers and computer were updated properly, working with TOPICS to come up with a solution, and resorting to hiring a professional to attempt to install it, the program never installed properly.  Excellent visuals, but no sound once you pass the opening screen and enter the ""Talk More"" section.  Also, the interactive DVD which I used on my television froze 10 minutes in.  TOPICS offers a refund, but declares it takes 90+ days to do so.  I do not recommend!",99,4

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This is probably the worst Spanish course I have encountered.  I have tried five so far and the very best is Pimsleur.  The speaker here gives the impression she is speaking to a five-year-old.  Then there are two discs of just rules, with little explanation.  This company should review the way Pimsleur does their their teaching, and starting you out with actually talking to another person.  I was so disappointed in this course.  Glad I got it free at the library instead of buying it.  I always try to check things out first before buying, and am grateful for the internet as I can get other reviews.",107,6
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,I finally got around to trying this product and it is subpar.  Could not understand the man dictating the words which means quality of the DVD's is bad. I then went to return to sender and I have passed the window of opportunity. Darn it.. wasted money !!!!!!,48,7

Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,The graphics and ease of use is much worse than Rosetta stone and not as much fun. It is easier to learn on Rosetta stone but you get what you pay for. this was cheap and can be a start...if you ever use it.,44,22

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This product is worthless, providing nothing more than a few words and NO grammar. Don't waste your time on this one, folks. There may be products out there that actually can teach someone a foreign language, but this isn't one of them.",42,25
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"Arrived on or before time. So far i am just begining, i plan on seeing how far this program will get me when i travel and have to use it. So far it look like a good program. Not too expensive, if you put some effort into it .",49,26

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,This is a great way to learn Spanish. With this software and someone to practice with I am already well on my way to mastering the first couple of levels. My only wish is that they had more then just the three levels. I hope they will produce the next three levels soon.,53,28

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,The software is slow and I am working on a Mac less than a year old.  It continually stops working and shuts down.  Unless I received a lemon this software is worth less than the cheap price I paid.,39,30

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"I bought this program at Costco.  My computer doesn't have a dvd drive, so I downloaded the software.  I think I did, but I guess I won't find out because when I attempted to activate the program, it will not accept it's own key!  Guess it'll be going back to Costco.  From this idiocy to reading these reviews after the fact, I guess I shouldn't have bought the program in the first place.",73,36
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This review may be a little premature since I have only used it once so far but I am very impressed! I have used the Rosetta version and love it, but lost the cd so could not reload the program after I got rid of my old computer. I did not want to pay that price again so decided to try this one. It works wonderful and is fun to use. One disappointment and I knew this before I chose to buy it is that this is Spain spanish and not the latin america that we are more used to in the states.",103,37
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,This is so frustrating! I have a macbook air and so I am spoiled and am not used to having programs crash. I have not gotten past the third screen to see if the learning program is good or not.  Seriously so aggravating!,43,38
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This is a great way to get started with a new language!

I use the CD at I go to and from work. That keeps the words fresh in my mind. The repetition of going through the CD multiple times also helps in retaining conjugation info, which is the most difficult for me to retain.

The lessons on the DVD are very good and allow you to go at your own pace and repeat as needed.",76,39
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,My computer whiz son-in-law had trouble loading this program for my granddaughter.  We were all disappointed that it wasn't a bid more user friendly.,24,40

Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"some fun games and stuff, you would do much better downloading a language app on your phone, or even better, making friends with spanish speakers. The best way to learn is to immerse yourself, listen to spanish music, watch spanish TV and go visit and make friends with Latinos, They will warmly welcome you and be glad to help a gringo out!!",62,42
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,I bought this for my son at Christmas.  It's a very well put together program.  It beats the leader by a country mile for a fraction of the cost.  Highly recommended.,31,43
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This product is terrible! Do not buy! It is decent only for a review of certain vocabulary words, but wouldn't actually aid in teaching one how to speak Spanish. I bought it because it seemed like a great purchase for the price. I guess you get what you pay for...",50,44
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"This application requires that my machine have a CD ROM / DVD Drive.  I have a USB CD ROM Drive, but the application does not install on my laptop, it runs directly from the CD ROM.  Can you say ""1995""??

I have no idea how good an application this is yet.  But I do know that if a CD ROM is required every time I run it that I will not use it.

So in case publishers have not heard, most mainstream laptops do not have built in CD ROM Drives anymore.  Requiring a drive to install is understandable.  Requiring a drive to run the app is not OK and has not been for several years now.",117,45
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,not that great.  simple and probably not what i would recommend to any one else wanting to pick up the language quick.,22,46

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"Bought this program to learn Spanish.  It give you a lot of material at the fraction of what Rosetta Stone charges.  The only problem I have with so much material to use is where to start.  For others this might not be a problem.  There are suggestions but not real lesson plans to follow.  I like it when ""tell you"" where to start and walk you through the course to the very end.  Not a deal killer but something I personally would like.  All in all, very impressed with the quality and quantity of this package.",96,49

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,So far I like this it's easy to use and compliments my introductory to Spanish class. I would reccommend this for beginners it's well worth the money. It's colorful and gives you picyures to guide you along the way.,39,51
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This product has been really helpful. Couple of notes: 1) It's Spain Spanish so be careful with pronunciation, and 2) the layout reminds me of old '90s cd-roms. It works and it really helps. It not flashy and I'm okay with that.",42,52
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"This is awesome if you don't have that much time for studying. Like all learning cds, it takes the commitment of the buyer and I don't have that. If you are bent on learning though, this is perfect and it doesn't burn your pockets like other learning materials do.",49,53
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"Great couple of games to help learning, but cumbersome to load on a mobile device would recommend more games to aid in learning",23,54

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"Not at all intimidating and super easy to work with.

I'm now motivated to buy the French version.",45,58
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This is nothing like Rosestta Stone, as it claims, much harder to follow and use, I was very very disappointed with this product. Wish I would have never sent back my Rosetta stone when I seen this product claiming to be as good for a whole lot less money, but now I know why it sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",56,59
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,Was not what I expected. It does not deliver. Extremely repetitive and the graphics on this is that of a children's game from the 1990's. I was so disappointed in this program.,32,60

Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,Came out of the gate with great intentions but just not my type of learning I guess. Might work better for others.,22,62
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"I'm from south Florida and am around Spanish all the time, so I just need more vocabulary and small sentence practice to get by. I got the 16 cd course for your car. The first 8 CDs were pretty good. Then you heard Spanish people in different conversations. I got nothing out of the last 8 CDs. The speakers spoke so fast I could only understand a few words in each sentence. To their credit they did they did repeat the sentences, but this approach did nothing for me. I listened to the entire course 3 times, and still could not understand the speakers. What made it worse was that they spoke the sentence very slowly in English, but then said it so fast in Spanish that it actually makes you angry that they do it this way.",138,63
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"This is basically usesless  and not worth the 20 bucks.  I tried it for about 10 minutes.  Go for Rosetta Stone, just spend the money, it's worth it.",28,64
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"After reading the reviews- I dove in.  I only got to play with the games/vocab level one for a couple hours one day- and couldn't believe how much of it I was remembering a couple weeks later.

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This software package is very easy to use, and offers ample opportunities to practice the language.

I followed the instructions how to download (included with the software) and neither of my two computers would start it. I even followed the ""auto play"" instructions included with the software, but alas, it would not start.  I tried other CDs on both of my computers to make sure it wasn't a computer problem and those CDs worked fine.  I tried the game disk, and it started, but there were no clear instructions how make the game GO and I gave up.  I sent this product back and will try a different program.",117,71

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"I had read numerous reviews on this program before I bought it.  I have had some formal training in the Spanish language for work.  I bought this package for the pure fact of listing to the cds while I am driving to work.  I have only listed to the first half or about 10 cds.  I have not utilized the DVD's nor the second half.  However, I wanted to let you know that you either need to write down the vocabulary and verbs so you can learn the words and listen to the cd again.  Or this package is great for a person that already has an understanding of the Spanish Language.  I think you get a lot of verb conjugation and word usage for the money out of this package and very easy to understand.  Good luck",138,79

If you are more motivated this will keep you going. Adios!,70,95
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,Decent exercises but the vocab is random.  That's my only gripe because it should follow more set categories like textbooks.  If you're just looking for a supplementary lesson then this is great and definitely worth the $380 or so you save from Rosetta Stone.,44,96

Overall, it's not bad for a software under $30. If you take full advantage of all the discs, I believe you should be very pleased. My only complaint would be the case. The CDs are all stacked upon one another in a plastic case. They're also very difficult to get out (or at least on my set, don't know if everyone is the same).

For $30 you are paying them tp package and ship this junk to you... not to learn a language. If you are looking to truly learn a language in a natural, tested, setting online/digitally I would strongly recommend the Rosetta Stone series.

First, it is very basic start to finish, and not well done as a language instruction package.

This product provided me enough to get around without bogging me down with too much information.  It took me a few times of doing the same exercises but I had figured it wouldn't be an instantaneous fluency.  I did download the MP3's on my Ipod but found myself skipping over most of the lessons and my mind wandering about a minute into listening.  Overall this product helped me out a little bit and the price was right, if you really want to become a fluent Spanish speaker I don't think this is going to do it unless you're some sort of language magician.",203,172
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"Contrary to what was advertised, the product only included Spanish phrases for the ipod, and no lecture; which are essentially useless by them selves.  Methods of teaching worked well for the PC components, but were a little '90s ish.",39,173
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"I returned this product soon after opening the box. The software seems to be a strange and confusing compilation of several different programs packed into one. It runs very slowly and freezes up often. I could not get the voice recording feature to work, and the ""Oscar Lake"" game is outdated and would not run in Vista. I plan on saving my money and purchasing a more expensive program.",69,174
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This is a decent, but not mind-blowing, learn-to-speak Spanish software package. On the positive side, it gets you listening to spoken and seeing written Spanish. The program presents a fairly comprehensive vocabulary that should cover many situations tourists and other new speakers might find them in.

On the negative side, the interface looks decidedly dated, and some of the vocabulary might be a bit esoteric for beginners.

Other than that, for the price, it's a good way to become more familiar with Spanish.",83,175
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"I though it was  little to difficult for kids at the young end of the age range advertised.  It was delived in a timely manner and packaged well, but my youngest child was lost on this software. However in terms of content it was not as advanced for older kids as I thought.

Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,"The sheer number of options available can be overwhelming but stay tuned, it gets better. After a straightforward installation and some time spent updating the software, you're presented with an intuitive interface. There are a good number of resources for help in using it, starting with a free 30-day installation support with registration. The manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer.

It wasn't difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips, most of it is just drag and drop. Cutting is easy, moving samples around is also very easy. There are a huge number of transitions, effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy. Less is more. All of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product.

The usual capabilities exist: adding audio, recording voiceovers and so on. In spite of this, the software isn't that cumbersome on system resources. Importing and exporting is straightforward as well. This is a solid performer that does all the basics any amateur would be satisfied with. Four stars.",189,1

I was eventually able to install portions of this software by opening them up, one-by-one, by exploring the disc files. I had to install them in bits, and even that wasn't entirely successful. I could not get ALL of this product installed on my computer, so I was only able to try out portions of it. Though what I did get installed does seem to be working, the experience of installing it was just too frustrating for me to be able to recommend this product to others.",119,6
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,4.0,positive,"Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus is an easy to use program that's great for those who have a bit of experience with video editing software, but users don't have to be an expert to get good results. Its fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features.  Installation was easy as well, and ran with no difficulties, although it took about 20 minutes to complete.

I was most interested in the Live Screen Capture feature, but it was a bit difficult to find.  Users are required to look for it in Program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it.  Despite that small flaw, Live Screen Capture works well most of the time.  For instance, it will capture video from MineCraft flawlessly, but I've had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games.

All around, Pinnacle Studio 17 Plus does a good job with minimal effort.",154,7

That's what I thought After the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems I had with Studio 17 and being charged to get support, I just gave up. There are so many other programs out there that are far superior than Pinnacle Systems. I would suggest going to your local Best Buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person (no charge) to compare programs to your needs. That is what I did after I through this in the garbage along with the Studio 17. Sorry Pinnacle..this was my last purchase with you",155,8
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,2.0,negative,"After trying - and liking - Pinnacle Studio 17, I was looking forward to giving Studio 17 Plus a try. But there have been too many frustrations in just getting it up and running to really enjoy it.
As many others have pointed out, installation takes HOURS, a process that data mines every media file on your computer (with no way to opt out). I work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no, I do not need to get bogged down in every file I ever processed each time I want to create something new. The learning curve is steep on this - the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly.
And as others have noted, be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating. I'll keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now, this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors.",180,9
Software,B00G6CLN3Y,5.0,positive,"Compared to Adobe Premiere Elements - which costs the same, this software blows it away in terms of features and capability.  I was using Premiere Elements for years but often got frustrated by the limited number of adjustments that I could me.  Sure Premiere Elements let me run automatic adjustments with lighting, color corrections, and scene transitions.  But when I wanted to get fancy, this software became limiting.  With Pinnacle Studio I am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than Abode, more scene transitions, and I'm able to tweak my videos in ways I never could before.  So far I'm really enjoying this software.  After 3 weeks I'm still discovering more that it can do!

Some people noted the difficult installation.  I wouldn't call it difficult.  I would call it time consuming.  But this I expect with any professional level video editing software.  These installations are huge, especially with all the features, macros, effects, etc that it installs.  Also, a strong processor is important when rendering videos.  I recommend 2 or 4 cores.",174,10

-Great 2d and 3D rendering
-Quick Processing
-Good interface

Cons:
-Snails pace install (Large software)

Then, when he was done it looked exactly like it did on the computer, inside and out! It was almost anti-climactic.

Also, on further inspection, I found some other paint scrapes on the back of the body as well.  Also, after placing the front wheel on and checking if it spun straight, I noticed that it was way off.  Basically, it wobbles. Fixing this either requires a trip to a bike store, or purchasing a spoke wrench to fix it myself if I understand correctly.  This shouldn't have come like that in my opinion.  This may get shipped back to amazon at this rate.  Also spent an hour trying to get the shifter adjusted so it would work in all 21 gears.  I appreciate that most of it was preassembled but come on.

After I finally assembled it (on pure instinct), the front brake was difficult to adjust - but I managed. The back brake is broken and needs to be replaced - I think. The shifting unit was not factory assembled properly. I had to take the shifting unit apart, as well as take the back tire off of the bike, and re-assemble it for it to even function. Now that it is functioning, I am trying to adjust it to shift properly. I guess that was too much to ask, because it is still not working properly. However, the bike looks awesome. I can't wait to finally be able to ride it....although it will probably be snowing by then.....",146,8
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,"This bike is very poor quality and I would not recommend. As an example, the front wheel spokes were so out of whack on receipt that the wheel looked warped. Whoever boxed it up at the factory should have noticed it was that way. It was not worth the hassle to return for another as a relacement might have been worse, and cost us more to get it ""tweaked"" by a professional after assembly than the bike cost. I'll never buy another Mongoose! What a waste of money!",88,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,Well i loved the bike at first. I was able to put it togehter easy enough and loved it for the first month. I rode it about ten miles a day for the past 4 to 5 months. The brakes are very difficult to keep adjusted and and also the gear shifter. The rear tire keeps coming loose from baering house and the bike is very heavy. I thought by buying a bike for a little bit more money than a k-mart or walmart would of done me good but in all i should of spent the money on a hi end bike for what i needed. So if you need a weekend warrior this is the bike for you. Amazon has always been the best internet shopping site. Please don't refer the rating of mongoose products to any afliates of amazon.,142,10
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,"Bike is good for casual riding. Use it extensively on the weekends and it's great. This is the first bike that I own and I was able to put it together and tune it up (I do minor work on my car so that may help). Keep in mind that when you get the bike not everything will feel right out of the box. You will need to use it for a week or two to tweak out the minor details (seat position/height, brakes, gear shifter, wheel alignment). Just keep your tools handy.",93,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,5.0,positive,This is the best bike I found in the low end price range.  I would suggest to anyone who purchases this bike to take it to a bicycle shop and have it professionally fine tuned and have them finish the assembly for you.  It really made a difference and for safety it is the best way to be sure the bike is operating at its best.  The man at the bicycle repair shop I took the bike to agreed this is the best bike you can buy for the price.  I purchased this bike for my fourteen year old and he is very happy with it.,106,12

As far as the quality of the bike I have only used it ride in my neighborhood (no mountain use). The bike assembled pretty easy (make sure you've got some allen wrenches)...had to get a new seat due to the fact I'm 230lbs...but I'm happy with it. The gears are kinda rough to shift so I mainly keep it in the same gear.

In addition, the front gear never shifts to 3.

the manual was easy to read, the gears were already assembled, which is a HUGE plus",55,26

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,"This bike is impressive looking, unfortunately, unless you are an expert bicycle mechanic you probably should look elsewhere.  The components of the bike are fairly cheap and getting the bike to work out of the box will consume many, many hours of time getting it operational.  The brakes used on the bike are of very low quality and should be replaced before operating.  In addition, the gears that come with the bike are also of extremely low quality and will need major adjustments in order for basic use.  Other than the brakes and the defailleur's, the other components are of average quality and perform as expected.

Bottom line is the frame and tires of this bike what you would expect for a bike in this price range.  Unfortunately, unless you are very experienced at adjusting and/or replacing brake mechanisms and derailleurs, there are simpler higher quality choices available elsewhere.",149,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,"oh I feel very bad of buying this bike. I bought this bike during the amazon thanksgiving deal for 60$. The bike came in a very heavy box and I moved the box into the living room and started assembling. Damn, there is no manual which says which part goes where. The product description says ""requires only minimal assembling"" but even to do that you at least need a manual. I unpacked it and had no idea on how to put things together, got very upset, so I put the things in the box again and moved it to a corner of my living room. It has been sitting there for a while. I saw lots of screws and small broken parts in the package. I have no idea what all these....

totally wasted 60$. So only if you have a complete bike assembling kit, have patience to spend at least 3 hours and of course able to assemble it by youself without having any manual, then go for it.

From the previous reviewers, it seems that it's not a great/sturdy mountain bike so be careful before buying. I am totally upset with this....",194,31

Best $15 I ever spent, it only took them an hour and it took me over 2 hours just trying to figure out the directions!

Amazon shipped the bike quickly and it arrived within three days after the order. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the handlebars, wheel, seat and pedals need to be assembled. No big problems except for front brake adjustment - they're cantilever brakes, so just take them apart, make sure you put the wheel in center, squeeze and tighten. It took me a while to adjust, but if you've assembled bikes before, it'll take less than 30 min.

No complaints, other than setup and that I have to carry it up and down two flights of stairs every day on my way to work :-D",130,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,"Received my shinning new bike, excitement, opened the box, assembled the parts, inflated the tires, checked the chain, joy, mounted it for my first ride, emotion, put my feet on the pedals, fresh air, good weather at 75F, happiness, started pedaling.... suddenly... loud CRACK!!!... WTF?... something fell off, pedals loosed, the ride stopped... now sadness, anger, rage.... damn!

What happened is that the Rear Derailleur (SRAM 3.0) simply broke for no reason. I'm a 5'7, 185 lbs non-athletic couch potato and there's no way I could have caused this breaking by just pedaling. Check the images I uploaded of the broken derailleur. (Customers Images)

This is definitively a case of bad quality plastic components used in an expensive product. I've seen cheaper bikes at local retailers (WMT, TGT, KMT) with better Shimano components.

Who's going to respond for it?",151,36

My only complaint is that the gear ratios are heavily biased torward uphill  biking, which makes going around town a bit slower.

Pacific Cycle mass produces bikes and sells them under a variety of names, including Mongoose, through variety of retailers. That's not necessarily a bad thing; it just depends on what you need. This bike is perfect for riding around town. It's light, reasonably durable, and comfortable. I've owned it (actually, I own the Walmart version which is virtually identical) for nearly 3 years and haven't had any serious problems or defects. I primarily use it in an urban setting (roads, sidewalks, curbs, pot holes, etc), and occasionally take it through parks and bicycle trails. The bike excels at these uses, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a serious, off-road/trail bike - it just isn't made to withstand that kind of stress. In short, if you want a real off-road bike, go to a bicycle shop and pay 400+ dollars, but if all you need is a bike to get around town then buy this one.",171,46

It came double boxed and was in great shape.  I only had to do a few simple steps and I was riding.  I did have to adjust the brakes and gears a bit, but I don't know much about bikes and it was really easy.

The good things are it doesn't look obvious as other cc pouches, it is made of durable material and it's not too big on my belt.

FYI, the dimensions of my Taurus compact pistols are (HxWxL) 5.125x1.25x6.125 (inches). This pouch holster fits any one of them like a glove. I don't think it will fit bigger pistols.",154,30

As reported by other reviewers, the alarm seems to go off at random times and there is no obvious way to stop it. I was hoping that the Sportline website might have a manual with better instructions.  The web site says that the manual can be found on the website, but I can't find it.

If you look at the picture, the interior support wire only goes about an inch down after it makes its second turn.  The rest is just foam.

I also wrote several times to the company to ask them about this and they never responded. So all in all, don't do business with Freestyle. How Consumer Reports rated this pedometer a Best Buy is beyond me.

The day the Freestyle broke all I could think was ""Good!, Now I get to find a better one!""

Many of the other pedometers cost two or more times the cost of this pedometer, and did not perform as well. After reviewing many comments, I purchased one, myself.
I have not been even remotely disappointed in my tracker. I find it to be spot on accurate, the design and feel of wear is sound, and with the price, it was the absolute best I could have hoped for. I wear it daily, tracking my steps and calories and distance into my fitness program.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,"I bought this pedometer so I could do the 10,000 steps program.  I ordered it around Christmas, so I expected it to be late.  The invoice had the pedometer highlighted as well as the safety leash.  There was no safety leash.  Trying to reach customer service at Heart Rate Monitors was difficult.  I was holding on the phone at the same time I was holding for a rep online.  I must have wasted 30 minutes waiting.  It took them 3 weeks to send the leash!  Customer service would get a 0 in my book.

The pedometer itself is very sensitive.  It is very easy to somehow reset the pedometer.  If you are going on a walk and want to know how far it is, I suppose the pedometer would work fine.  But if you are doing the 10,000 steps program and wearing it all day long during regular activities, it will some how reset itself.  I'm careful when I use the restroom that I don't touch the button.  I don't wear my purse on that side so it doesn't some into contact with the pedometer.  And the thing still resets itself!

Of the 7 that did make it in one piece, they are what you would expect for being so inexpensive.  Plastic throughout, with some inconsistencies in the manufacturing process so there are little blemishes here and there.

This is mainly to keep letting people know problems haven't been fixed. Expect many of them to arrive broken. If you only need a few, you are good. If you need them all, pick them up at a local party store.",97,17

Should have gone to the dollar store!",59,18

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,The price is very good. The only downside to this mat is there are no straps to keep it rolled. And it is a bit difficult to roll this one tightly. Minor inconvenience to not have these things in order to pay a much cheaper price,46,15

It doesn't seem very strong so I'd waver before using on the ground, but in a hammock it's great. It provides a little stiffness, but also deforms nicely to the shape of the hammock. (If you like your bedroll to flatten the hammock out this isn't the pad for you.) It's also incredibly light weight. I wish it rolled up a little tighter, but that's a pretty minor quibble.",81,20
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,"Not really what I was expecting. I feel like it's the same stuff they pack electronics in. Not very high quality, I was thinking it would be a thicker foam, but it's more like a bubble wrap.",37,21

On the other hand, I am big into the outdoors and if you want this for camping, it is cheap and will not insulate you to any degree of comfort. Don't be cheap with your sleep, get a good pad....this isn't it. It would be ok as an added layer of foam, but that is about it.",103,40
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,It's literally a piece of garbage. I don't really know who uses this camp pad in camping. A lot of better options at almost the same price.,27,41

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,Perfect for my sleeping bag when used with an inflatable. Protects the inflatable foam from rocks etc. No chemical odor.,20,47

Doesn't even compare to a thermarest or any other camp mat for that matter.  I cut it down to fit the dog, and brought it along.  I felt terrible for the dog for making him sleep on it, and it's never coming on a trip like that again.  Spend the extra money.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,"not what I expected - It's only a thin piece of foam - no good for camping.  The ground at my camp site was not rocky, but it was hard.  It hurt my hip bone to lay on my side.",40,54

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,This pad is much thinner and seems more temporary than what I expected. I definitely have buyer's remorse. Not worth $10.,21,57

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,"It was just as I ordered, and it is going to fit well in the sleeping bag, it is the right size, thank you!",24,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,"Pros:  It's cheap in price, yet feels solid and provide adequate cushion.  Rolls up and fits on my pack.

Cons:  It's bulky when rolled up and on the pack.  The color is pretty weak, unless baby blue is your thing, but hey, it was 9 bucks.

Size:  This is sized to match the average sleeping bag.  I'm 5'10 and 175 lbs, and I fit on it nicely.  No overhang, but not too much extra room on the sides  It does, however, have about 3-5 inches of room at the end I'm planning on shaving off to reduce the size.",99,62

If space is an issue during packing for a camping trip, this will definitely be the 1st thing left behind. Doesn't provide enough comfort to justify the amount of space it will take up.

Like other reviews state, this is basically packing material. The advertised photo makes it look like a higher quality pad than it actually is.

I only added it to my cart to get a $20 discount, so it wasn't a loss for me. However, I'd be upset if I actually spent $14.99 on it. Should be sold for $5.

Just spend a few extra bucks and get something that is actually good quality.",120,68

Was surprised to find a lower price.  SO-- While I DON'T HAVE THIS PAD-- I gave it 2 stars-- based on  getting it cheaper somewhere else, and believing that our pad-- which is nearly an inch thick-- is GREAT-- and 3/8 of an inch must really leave something to be desired!

It's not super cushy, so you need a flat and smooth place to lay it on, but it does provide some cushioning against the hard ground.  We got this to use as an isolation mat, not for its cushioning, and it does that job exceptionally well.  It's wide enough to easily fit a ""thick"" adult on it, from shin to head (I am 5'10"") and keep the ground from sucking all the heat out of you.  The bottom side of me was the warmest side of me while laying on this mat, and that was in 35* nights, so I would guess that even at cooler temperatures it would do a good job of insulating your body from the cold ground.
For the price, it can't be beat for its insulating properties, but if you are looking for a ""feather bed"" affect, this isn't the mat for you.",165,73

First, the case is very cheaply made and it's almost impossible to remove/return pieces back into the molds. You pretty much have to hammer the dies in/pry the taps with a screwdriver.

Second, there's something not right about the tightening mechanism of the tap handle which makes the taps loosen after a couple of turns and therefore lean to the side during a cut.

Even with much care and cutting oil, I've broken the taps with little effort. The handles to hold these are a total joke, and a serious pain to use. It does not securely hold the taps or dies securely, and makes it tough to properly align or start them into the piece you are trying to thread.

Tried re-tapping one single hole on a motorcycle fender and followed their directions for pre-drilling size to a T and the tap snapped off in the hole.  This was a monumental problem as the steel is hardened well beyond that of any drill bit, making it essentially impossible to drill it out.  I ended up having to grind out the entire nut that was welded in there and welding a new nut on, which had the lovely side effect of burning the paint on the other side.

Unless you absolutely positively don't care about the item you're tapping, don't use these.  I understand that it's a cheap set, but I'd except it to at least work ONCE without breaking.  The cost savings isn't worth the potential hassle.",129,68

The screw driver magnet broke in the first few uses, crescent wrench is useless.

Spark plug sockets came in handy but then I remembered that the bike came with a spark plug tool which worked better. But one of them was used to remove the front wheel from a 2005 R6 with a pair of vice grips to hold in place.

Finally after 2 years of service the ratchet gave out, which means I need to get a new one. I'll most likely get a new Craftsman set from Sears since their warranty is excellent.

My only complain is some of the pieces don't fit into the clamshell very well and are difficult to get out and put back into their places. They are marring the case so it will eventually have a hole.

I don't know if this is a complaint or normal with these types of tools (because this is my first) but the tap wrench becomes loose and must be tightened several times during a tapping event. One handle tightens one way and the other in reverse so as you tighten one, the other loosens. I fixed this by putting threadlock on the one that is supposed to be stationary.",164,122

I'll purchase a replacement wrench at my local Ace Hardware store & hope that the taps & dies are OK for limited house hold chores.

Its good for its price, if you want lasting tools you'll have to pay more.

The box doesn't really close properly now, there are a lot of missing pieces from over the years and a few of tools have rust around them and what not.

I didn't really take care of the tools, but whatever they did their job. I was expecting everything to last longer but, for that you'll have to pay more.

If you just keep these in your garage and use it from time to time and store it properly and take care of it. I am sure that these will last a long time.

The tools are held in by plastic retaining clips that were broken or mis-formed.  All the tools were everywhere, and 8 or 10 would not go back in their retainers.  This makes for a nice rattle sound as you are driving... good fun.  Most of the parts are small, clips, retainers, screw tips.... etc.  You would be be better off getting a few decent tools from Home Depot or Craftsman and a small tool box.

The rack was twisted.  One screw was loose, another had the nut laying in the bottom of the box.  I took the punches out to fix the loose screws and discovered the rack had been twisted so far out of alignment that one of the punch holes had been torn.

The final discovery was when I tried to put the loose nut onto its screw.  It wouldn't stay so I decided to replace it.  I pulled the screw out and discovered it wasn't threaded.  Apparently whoever assembled the rack was more interested in getting it shipped then quality control.

On mine, the metal carrier is not very well aligned (the middle support shelf is not welded exactly parallel, but the top and bottoms are).  The size of each punch is stamped or etched on the top which is nice.  This set is made in China.

Concerned that this may be a cheap imitation, I contacted the Fowler corporation and was told that this is indeed a Fowler product.  I made a few punches into cherry stock and the tip showed no sign of wear.  The punches themselves look well made.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,"This was quite a disappointment. My first order arrived with the stone broken in three pieces. This wasn't a big deal as Amazon was awesome and replaced it with no trouble. When I received the replacement and started trying to use it, however, it's kind of a piece of garbage. The stone has inconsistencies that cause audible clicks while sharpening, and has a visible bow to it from the factory, causing grinds to be slightly convex on the rough side and concave on the fine side, which increases the work of sharpening by a lot and reduces control of the angles. There is also a raised burr on one end of the stone on the fine side which you run the risk of slamming your freshly honed blade into if you're not attentive and careful. The honing guide has a flat spot on one of its wheels, causing the blade to wobble while grinding. In the end I'm going to have to replace everything here with better products except for the oil, which I've already mostly used on the stone. I'd recommend you skip this and go for something better, this one doesn't even do the job as a cheaper entry level sharpening stone.",204,35

I just started restoring an old plane and though this would be an easy way to get started. The honing guide is very inaccurate as the plastic piece that helps determine the angle is quite loose and not precise.  You could hone two different times and start honing a different angle from the initial time.  The stone also go clogged easily and soaked up quite a bit of the oil on the first use.  It's also a bit too narrow for a plane.  It will work, but a larger surface would be much easier.  Spend a little bit more money and don't waste your time on this product.  It might be good for other projects like small knife sharpening, but the honing guide is a paperweight now.",151,36

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,"This has worked well for me for it's intended purpose. It's not the best quality, but it is good. As a carpenter, I've used it to keep my chisels and plane blades sharp for the last 4 years. Using the guide seems like a hassle in the middle of a job, it can be a little tedious to square, but it really does give you a better cutting edge when you can keep the blade angle perfectly straight. The only improvement I'd like to see on this is a guide to help square what ever blade you're putting in it. If you aren't sharping blades all the time you really don't need the guide but what I paid for this was about the same as the price of a decent stone and small bottle of oil anyways so I basically got the guide for free. I consider that to be a good value, but do your own pricing research before you buy if cost is an issue for you.",169,56

The gauge I don't use as it seems clunky and just seems easier to do by hand. The oil soaks straight into the stone so it provides very little lubrication. I ended up getting wet/dry sandpaper of varying grits and wrapping it around the stone to sharpen my chisels. The surface is flat which is the only thing I really like about it. But I could have gotten the same effect from an old piece of glass. So overall, I'd save your money and get something different.",116,59

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,2.0,negative,"While certainly cheaper than some of the other honing jigs out there I've noticed a tendency of most chisels to skew as I'm sharpening. I notice this even though I try to make it really tight. I didn't notice this as much with my hand plane blades. I do like the built in angle measuring function. It's really handy and makes changing your angle easy. That is kind of put to the side though if things shift too easily. There are markings that are supposed to help you keep things straight but they aren't incremental enough for the common chisels that I put in (1/4, 1/2, 3/4 & 1-1/2). I am admittedly new at this with a honing jig so perhaps I just need more practice. I spent a couple of afternoons cleaning up some old blades and there is a large improvement in sharpness.

As we use then we hold a chisel vertical and either drag it towards or away from ones self.  Good boat guys learn to push it away but I lack the acquired strength and drag it towards.

I could tell a night-and-day difference between this bulb and an ordinary incandescent. It's (very) noticeably dimmer than the energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs I have around my house.

So why do I like them? Well, an ordinary incandescent bulb might use 60 watts of power and this thing uses 3. Even 60-watt replacement compact fluorescent bulbs use about 17 watts of power, so these bulbs even make other ""energy saving"" bulbs look like power hogs by comparison.

The key consideration before buying is where you think relatively dim bulbs might make sense for your needs. For me, I have a porch light and two lights on either side of my garage that run all night. The light is enough to illuminate that outdoor area well enough, and since the lights run all night, using these light bulbs saves quite a bit of juice!

A typical light in a living room, for instance, may use a 150 Watt incandescent bulb. In order to get somewhere near the same amount of light, that living room need three LED bulbs to replace the incandescent bulb.

If you want to try an LED bulb then buy a brighter one based on the lumen rating.  After searching I've found a 13 watt LED bulb with 900 lumen, but it's $70.  Subtract wasted money from this and it's really only $60.

Edited 1-17-09: This light is dimmer than the 3 watt mini MagLite Mag Lite",95,54

The pros: Only 3 watts and 50,000 hour bulb life.  No mercury like in CFLs.  Cool to the touch.

Not what you want to see on a cold winter night.  But they're the cheapest, so that's what they produce.

I would easily pay $30 for a warm white than $20 for cold white.

Some of the liquid coating that covers that casting dripped onto the ways, so I scrapped that off before sanding and filing. I then coated it with regular synthetic oil (same lube I use on my mini lathe) and put it back together. There is no play at all in either direction.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"ok, it is cheap, but I don't need to do any super-precision work, and I figured that for something made out of metal, I could get this thing dialed in. (I'm an engineer) well, it is actually pretty solid and would have potential except for one very critical component. The lower axis screw threads through and drives a small, loosely mounted threaded block made out of PLASTIC. This interface has an incredible amount of play which can not be adjusted, and if the plastic wears out (which it will!) the play will get worse, and when it breaks, you no longer can move that axis. Strangely, the upper axis threads through cast metal, and is reasonably solid.",117,15

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,"Like others stated, low manufacturing tolerances leaves room for parts to wiggle.  Take it apart, lube appropriately and reassemble, tightening nuts, bolts, and screws and the looseness goes away.  Not bad for hobby work.  High precision or repetitive manufacturing will likely need something significantly more expensive.",46,22

I should have researched this tool better before I ordered it. I wasted my money.
It is too rough to be used for milling, but it does work as an oversized vice, although it might be more useful as an anchor--but I don't have a boat.
The vice came with a broken-off crank handle--not from shipping, the package was fine. The postage to return it isn't worth the benefit of a refund.

As everybody else said this is a DIY project, if you are expecting a ready to use product out of the box then this item will get another one star review.

I spent an hour disassembling and cleaning the vise right out of the box (BTW the brand name on the box is ""Stark"".)

It may be better to buy a 3"" one for a 15 "" drill press, but I bought a larger commercial 20"" drill press at an estate sale and it fits it better. I will know better how it is after some use.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,"I just finished doing the task I bought the thing for. Here are a few observations. Using an end mill with this slide table is problematic. Pretty much drill bit only. Chatter is death to an end mill and the work you are trying to complete. That said, you can easily rough the work and use the end mill for plunge finishing pockets which was just as effective if not as fast as just using the end mill to mill out a pocket. Super drill press vise if you spend time setting it up. 80% receivers can be finished with patience but you aren't buying a bench top mill here. If you combine the price of a drill press plus this slide table, you can get a hobby mill that would be much better suited. If you already have a drill press, this is worthy of purchase.",147,66

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,"As others have indicated it is a roughly manufactured vice. The Acme threads on the three screws (vice closure, X and Y axis) are very sloppy. I was able to completely disassemble, clean and lube it. It smoothed out the operation considerably. Nothing can be done about the slop between the male/female threads but you can adjust the tension on the gibs using the set screws to have a reasonable piece of equipment. I have it mounted on a 5/8"" drill press and it performs well. Well worth the money considering it ships free and weighs about 30#.",98,73
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,Anyone who gave this less than 4 stars must not realize exactly how the world works.  Listen...you aren't going to mill parts for a Swiss watch or anything with this thing.  But it works exactly how you would expect a vise this price would.  For any person that repairs stuff around the house or small shop that needs decent quality work this is fine.  If you aren't happy with the quality at the price then fork over the $200-$300 for one that is intended for that.,86,74

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,Would not buy! For a vise to come broken just says it all made very cheap. Spend more and get a good vise I wanted it for one project and I couldn't even do that  they took it back with no problem though so that was good,47,76
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,"Expecting precise repeatability and high quality at this price point is for fools.  This is something that, at best, should be expected to be a compromise and never more than ""good enough"".

In my case, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the vise, the out-of-the-box performance, and the quality of machining.  Though the excellent machining may have been a fluke, I have been impressed with this vise, for the price.

My only real complaints are: The handles are a joke.  They're floppy, flimsy, and appear to be bakelite.  And, the paint job is laughable.  The vise appears to have been dipped in a mixture of recycled enamels, baked, and then finish-machined.  There are even brass and steel chips cured/baked into the multi-colored paint on mine.",127,77

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,There are expensive mill vises out there but I was on a budget and this works well. Does require some lube for smooth movement and some adjustment to remove slack but then it's ready to go.,36,83
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"Total waste of my money -- the machining on this sand-cast import cross slide vise is very rough and inaccurate. On my copy, the upper dovetails are not parallel, so it's sloppy loose on one end of the travel, and jamming tight on the other. To use it, I have to be continually adjusting the three tension screws along the side of the dovetail. Furthermore, the lower and upper dovetails are not exactly 90 degrees, so I had to make a set of special tapered jaws for it to correct for the run-out.

I didn't expect machine-shop mill quality at this price, but I can't even cut a decent slot in thin aluminum with it.

It's OK for positioning a piece to drill a hole, but useless for any milling or slotting.",132,84

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,This thing is garbage. The thing is so wobbly and shaky. The screw thread clamps are not even close to quality. they hardly turn with normal handles as shown in the photo.

It's also terrible with plastic straps.,80,87
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,I expected that I would need to clean and adjust but this thing is barely functional.  The bottom screw for the slide doesn't extend to the outside of the vice casting so it wobbles around and gets stuck.  The vice portion has a catch in the middle because the flat sliding surface does not appear to be parallel with the shaft that the jaw rides upon.  To adjust I will need to drill out a pin.  Very poor quality.  I will stick with HF in the future.,87,88
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"I am used to dealing with cheap tooling.  With a bit a babying or cleanup, you can quite often get a good deal.  This, however, is just  awful.  All slides wiggle side to side.  You can clamp down the screws a bit and this helps a bit, but then it doesn't slide well.  The KILLER, however, is the lower pin that mates with the lower gear drive: it is not round and is so undersized that the entire lower stage has 1/8 of slop.  If you were to try and drill anything tougher than thin plastic, it will shake and either make an oval hole, damage the bit or both.  Avoid.",111,89

This vise, unlike others has a nice low profile.  My big disappointment was that the rotation handles were not like those shown in the photo of the product.  I made this choice partly because of the handles.  I plan to voice my disappointment with the company selling these.  For a device like this, the handles are important.

It does seem to track strait. I am not seeing lots of wobble.  It has smooth face jaws, so marring of the work will not be a problem.  You may want to take the vise apart, if only to understand all the parts and how they work together.",139,101

I do A LOT of research before I buy just about anything. I'm glad I did for this Cross Vise. It comes as others have stated, covered in varnish/cosmoline/grease. It needs to be removed. I took the entire vise apart, used a rotary tool to polish the sliding surfaces, and then cleaned everything in my parts washer. It cleaned up well! I then treated it as a ""gun"" and oiled everything as needed, added grease to certain areas and put it back together, tightening everything...I did not have to replace anything...as once it was put back together...it's almost like a $150-$200 cross vise. I say almost as there is a bit of loss in it's precision...but for what I needed it for, no issue.

Overall, once you do the work (keep in mind, you really are saving a lot of money over other models that come to you almost in the same, unusable condition)...it is WELL WORTH every dollar of money and time!",191,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,this vice is a great addition to my bench top drill press. i have had it for a while now and have been using it on almost a daily basis...not just for milling work but it also works well as a bench top vice to...i use this vice more than my standard bench top. this cross slide is a great buy. for the money you cant get a better cross slide vice...i have used it to mill 6061 T6511 aluminum and various types of steel as well as other materials with no hang ups....i did have to polish the surfaces that the vice slides on....{not required}...but i am picky and it was sliding a little gritty feeling at first...but after i got it polished up it works awesome now...,129,104
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,"It is not the smoothest operation of gears in the world, and it seems ""universal"" in the sense I'm not sure what platform it's designed for.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,"Like many others here, I found the bolts loose and movement very stiff. Took it apart, cleaned all the shipping gunk off, polished and lubricated it. The vise is now a solid, smooth piece of equipment.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,4.0,positive,"Screws must be tightened past ehere wheels can be turned with the handle. Other than that, this vise works fine.

Im milling delrin (plastic), which is just a bit easier than aluminum. My drill press table won't lock anymore - probably because of all the plastic shavings - but the vise works perfectly.",53,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,Pleasantly surprised! The ways on this vise are adjustable so you can make it nice and tight. The handles have some play in them so I used some loc-tite green for cylindrical bonding to stiffen them up. A few minutes to adjust all the points of  the slides and properly lubricate it and it is a decent vise for under 30 bucks for all the little drill press projects I am going to do !,75,108

I like the little vice.  I have a machine shop so I can make things to tweek this product.  For example, if you want the vice in the middle of the table, you'll have to have an extension bar to move your y axis because the handle will hit the table.  It works and if that's all you want, then....enjoy.  If you want precision, go to Kurt.",95,109

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"I was hoping to get one of these simply to increase the accuracy of spotting holes on pieces using a center drill in my drill press. I went to local tool supply store to check this item out and it was simply a very cheap piece of Chinese junk...far worse than I expected. Of course, the price raised that flag. So I put it back in the box and didn't buy it. Would rather spend two or three times the asking price  for something a bit more solid and accurate.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,Those of you complaining about the quality of the product are probably not happy with anything ever. You need to consider that you cant even buy a standard bench vise for 30 dollars let alone a vise with an x and y axis movement. Those of you with realistic expectations will be thoroughly satisfied. Those of you who want professional machinist quality results will need to shell out 100 dollars or more. You get what you pay for. I am totally happy with the vise because I had 30 dollar expectations for a 30 dollar product.,96,115
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,I expected this unit to be somewhat sloppy due to the very low price. I was prepared to disassemble and polish all the mating surfaces. The paint blobs pressed into the surfaces and crude machine work should be expected for such a cheap unit. What I didn't expect were key ways that were milled off by 10 degrees. The mating surfaces only contact at their edges which were pitted and irregular. There is no way to get a reasonable amount of slop out of it without it binding in places across its travel. It's not worth returning it due to the cost for shipping a heavy item. I'll use it as a fixed vise. Forget milling with it.,118,116

Bottom line - heavy junk, might work as a boat anchor.",64,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"Very poor quality.  The ways were machined poorly (very rough and uneven machining with lots of chatter) and the adjusting screws were cheap.  I was unable to get the excessive play out of the ways, even after much tinkering.  There is also a lot of end play in the lead screws, especially the bottom axis.  The bottom axis on my vise slides back and forth about 1/8"" without turning the lead screw. This makes it almost impossible to position anything in the vise reliably.  After taking the vise apart, I noticed that one of the adjustment shims was drilled completely through so the adjustment screw wasn't pushing on the shim, but directly on the way itself.  I was going to bring the whole thing to my relatives machine shop to re-mill the entire vise, but I think it would be easier to build a whole new vise from scratch instead of fixing this one. Don't waste your money, no matter how low the price.",164,119

The quality of the stakes was poor and two of them bent immediately trying to put them in to the same holes I had before.  The lanterns themselves were flimsy/cheap (not made in Heartland America, at least the Heartland America I know).  The lanterns may have worked a whole few weeks and then they died; never to return.  I should have sent this junk back, but I didn't.  I live in south-central New Mexico and we have sunshine...lots of sunshine...more than enough to charge these ""lights"".

Lily Home light use only one battery instead of two.  It has 2 battery compartment but one is not wired up.  So the light is very dim and almost could not see that is on.  Even the candle itself is very small not like the one Heartland of America which is big.  Did Amazon do a switch on me because it said the light is by Heartland of America.  The product detail is Lily Home.  Did Amazon advertised one thing and sell the other.  May be Heartland of America product is sold out so they sub the Lily Home instead.

As an FYI and having owned similar solar lights before, I took these apart and put caulking around the inside of the solar panel holder, which tends to leak and allow rainwater into the electronics.

These lights are decorative, they're not bright enough to light a walkway. They have withstood plenty of wind and rain.

They do need a lot of sun to charge. I've had the best luck with them on the south side of the house. But you can remove the batteries and charge them if you have a NiCd battery charger.

When they did work, the lights did not stay on for very long.  What I found out after only a few days of use is that the top plastic part have several sections that are glued together and the glue stopped holding and the top part of the lights started coming apart which caused the wiring to pull apart.  After trying to fix this, I was so aggravated at how cheaply they were made and how they kept falling apart that I threw three of the four lights I bought out.  A complete waste of money.

This timer is all electronic and has a back-up battery - thus, taking almost no power to operate and keeps it's timing cycle after power outages.  After replacing 3 electric timers with these, a measurable drop in KWH was noted - making it a good ""green"" device.

I know other people complain about the mailbox door, and yes, it comes off pretty easily, but it's no big deal to slip it back on at all.  My nephew loves the ""mail"" too - he will put them in the box and take them out over and over again.

This is a sturdy toy, and perfect for a kid who's almost walking but not quite.  For what it's worth, my 2-and-a-half-year-old niece loved this toy, too!  She kept stealing it from my nephew and trying to put all kinds of toys in the mailbox.

He likes to ""drop"" the mail into the mail slots. He also enjoys playing with the bee and caterpillar, it isn't difficut to move at all for him. The mail doors do come off easily, but it is not bothersome at all- I guess it just depends on what the child is more interested in doing. My son just loves to push it all around. I think its a great toy and helps begining walkers. I would recommend it to anyone!!",110,71
Toys_and_Games,B000096P3A,4.0,positive,"I bought this walker for my son when he was 9 months.  It was much less expensive than the other walkers, and I liked that it had a wide track and wheel speed control.  I was initially very disappointed.  Like the other reviewers I couldn't believe how easily the mailbox slots fall off.  We had the toy home and assembled for 10 minutes and the bottom mailbox fell off and our dog chewed it up.  Even with the wheels on the slowest setting the walker would go too fast for my son to keep up, and it skids on all surfaces even though it claims to have wheels that grip.

HOWEVER, my son LOVES this toy, and loves to pull of the mail slot and play with the plastic envelopes.  Now at 10 months he can pull himself up easily on it without tipping it onto himself and can cruise around the house pushing it.  He likes to put his stuffed animals in the mail slot area and give them rides.  I'm so glad I didn't get rid of it right away which was my first instinct, because this is his current favorite.",193,72

It was stable esp. as she started out, leaning on it & then pushing it ... now she can steer it & gets great satisfaction as she negotiates corners and doorways. I like the speed adjustment on the wheels. The stickers faded outside (it's an indoor/outdoor toy with us) and the dexterity activities on it are pretty lame, but she is mainly just go-go-go w/this.

In addition, I agree with several of the other parents' comments about the flaps being EASY to come off and then a hazard.  My son loved (in the 1 day we owned it) to pull off the flap with the spinning disk and then promptly got his hand caught and pinched in it as he tried to lean on it.

From the moment we put this thing together my wife and I were concerned about it.  If you have hardwood floors be prepared to chase your child around as the walker simply slides uncontrollably across the floor.  My biggest criticism is that the weight distribution is totally screwed up.  Presumably, this walker is being used by children who are learning to walk.  When our daughter pulls herself up on the handle, there is not enough weight in the front to prevent the walker from tipping over.  I'm no engineer, but something about the design is all wrong.

No, there are 11.  Yes, 11.  I was so happy when I stood my little girl up with it and it didn't roll out from her.  That is why I would reccomend this walker to everyone I know!

The two doors, like the other reviewers said, come off way too easily. Once they're off -- there is little left on the toy except the boring sliders (in comparison to other baby toys). The three ""letters"" just float around the junk pile and are a waste.

If my son gets to the point to where he takes it off to use as a stair to get on furniture, I will simply super-glue the doors on there so that he can't.
I do believe it is sturdy, though.  I think that is proven by my son's age, weight, and use of the toy.

Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,Purchased this as a gag gift so I can't review as to how well they work for a magician but this was a fun item that was packaged nicely and worked for the few times it had been used. Seems like it would last and does look like a real fork when it's not extended.,55,1
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,4.0,positive,"The fork is a fun party trick and is durable enough for some good laughs.

However, don't expect quality flatware here.  The metal is pretty thin, and as another reviewer said, you have to fork at an angle to prevent it from collapsing.  Also, the extendability makes washing just a little more challenging.",53,2

It's just fun!,67,20
Toys_and_Games,B001THAEZE,2.0,negative,"This was meant to be a funny birthday gift for my brother, and initially it was fine when I took it out of the package and tested it. However after I washed it off and took it to dinner, as soon as I fully extended it the brackets on the inside of the end piece popped off and therefore it lost about 6"" or so of extension coming apart.

It isn't very durable but for the price it was worth it.  I think I used it 4 times total before it broke in half where the telescoping portion attaches to the fork portion.

The telescoping portion is similar to the old school radio antenna's and is somewhat fragile.  The fork portion came in completely flat, like it had been stamped out of a flat piece of metal.  After some bending and prying I got it to resemble a fork, adding to the realism of it.",114,33

Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,"This game is beyong difficult to figure out! Even the main menue is confusing. Not only that, but controlling the characters in the game is a proccess in itself. I wouldnt reccommend this game for anyone under 14 years of age and good luck trying to figure it out!",49,9
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,"When I bought this, I thought that it would involve a lot of activity and excitement. However, when I started playing, I was really disappointed. I agree with all the reviewers that say the graphics and everything is great, but that's not what the point of playing. The point is having fun and not thinking that what you're playing was a waste of money...and frankly, that's not what I think of this game. For every sport (curling, bobsleigh, etc), there are different levels, and they're pretty hard, even for the easiest level. Also, sometimes the controller doesn't work with it and it gets really frustrating. The different sports are pretty boring to play, and it doesn't require a lot of movement AT ALL.

Bottom line: If you are looking for a fun and exciting game, then you should not get this. The sports should involve a lot of movement, but instead, you're just sitting on the couch holding the remote horizontally and tilting it side to side. Plus, the game can be really hard sometimes, and with the controller not working properly, it just makes it all the worse. Save money. Don't buy it.",194,10
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,"Thought these games would be more in line with the Wii sports -- not so. Has a very annoying commentary, instructions and choosing of game.  I bought for exercise and the only exercise anyone will get is in their wrists! No fun at all!",44,11

Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,"What I hate about standard video games is having to remember what button to push when to make a character do an action.  That's why I LOVE the Wii - the controllers allow true motion to determine the action.

But not in Winter Sport.  You have to pump controls and hit buttons and I just didn't want a game like that.  I wanted to do the motions of skiing or lugeing or what ever.

Not my cup of tea, though I'm sure it's a bunch of fun if you're used to that type of game.  It looks great.",98,14
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,It looks like fun from the case but the actual game was complicated and blurry and hard to navigate through and even after we figured it out the games were not that fun.  I can see why someone wanted to sell it.,42,15
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,"I wanted to have fun with the game because the graphics are very nice to look at.  Unfortunately, the difficulty of the events (even on the easy mode) made it completely impossible to play.  Downhill skiing looked fantastic, but I was in the fence every 3 seconds.  The bobsled did better on its own without me doing a thing...now that's odd.",61,16
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,"I personally didn't like this at all.  It was to difficult for the children (ages 8-14) and they have not played it more than four or five times.  I was dissapointed with the whole things.  Graphics are OK, but the gaming experience is just boring.",45,17
Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,"My favorites are the ski jump and the downhill skiing. I have learned quite a bit about skiing from this game (grew up water skiing, not snow). I would like for the events to be longer in length - to produce a more sustained workout. But, overall I enjoy this game.",51,18
Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,"This was a total waste of money.  The accuracy of the remote is poor.  On one game, I just set the remote down and the event continued without any activity by me.  There is also annoying commentary throughout the events.",40,19
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,"The controls are lame.  The announcers and background music were annoying.  The announcers were hard to understand because the music was louder than their voices.

All in all it was pretty boring.",60,20
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,This game needs a nunchuck and it is very difficult to manipulate the controls to follow the action. My seven year old granddaughter was disappointed and she is an expert with other wi games that use the nunchucks.,38,21

Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,"This game is a lot of fun, but it is not exactly a thrill, seat of your pants, kind of game. There are so many different games to play, that you will be hard pressed to not enjoy something about this game. The graphics are good. The game play is good. The controls are good. My son loves it. My daughter loves it. It's a lot of fun and at this price, it is a good value.....Let the games begin!",80,24

All in all, maybe as an amatuer gamer- it's just not for me.  I was hoping it would be fun and it is just frustrating.  I guess my patience level is low for entertainment that is impossible on the EZ settings.  I would only recommend if you think you can master any game!",81,25
Video_Games,B000X418EU,2.0,negative,The game is poor at best.  It might be a good game if you want to spend a long time figuring out the controls and how to actually play each event but if not then stay away.  The controls are anything but intuitive and in some cases are just plain stupid and this really ruins the game.  I'm all for games that offer a challenge but not ones that are close to impossible at first because the control system is so bad.

Video_Games,B000X418EU,1.0,negative,"We had high hopes for this game, but the bobsled/luge is WAY too easy and the skiing is WAY too difficult.  For bobsled, all you do is tilt the controller one way or another, and it's very simple to stay in the line that they display for you.  For skiing, it's not too bad, but unless you're extremely patient and want to practice a lot, it's difficult to see any improvement in the short-term.",74,37

I only read the amazon reviews though before purchasing and they seemed to be pretty good.  I thought it would be fun to do some 2 player skiing, but you need 2 nunchuks for that and I only have one.  This game is not anything like the other snowboarding/skiing games where there are power ups, you go off jumps, build up your character, etc.  There seems to be only 1 course/run/trail per activity (skiing, sledding, etc) too, so it gets pretty boring pretty fast.

The instructions for the controls on screen aren't that great, I would recommend reading the instructions in the manual first. I do think this will be a great party game with our friends and family.

Video_Games,B000X418EU,4.0,positive,"Except for figure skating, most of the events are lots of fun. The actions required in figure skating seem to have no relation whatsoever to the actual sport.
Excelling at some of the events is quite difficult. There is a high degree of arm movement required in many of the events, although leg movement is unnecessary.
Our favorite at this point is downhill skiing.  Ghost competition against a family member in split screen is especially fun.
One improvement I would suggest is to allow direct competition between family members in Curling. One can play at the same time as another family member, but never directly. There is always an opposing computer-generated team.
I do recommend this game, but be prepared (in some events) to spend a lot of time getting good at it.",133,48

However, you'll find that many of the events are rather fun, such as the luge, bobsled, cross country and ski jumping (although I'm still trying to figure what makes me really jump farther).  Especially notewothy is the curling.  You can actually play a full 9 frame match with 8 stones each frame, either against the computer or another team.  This curling event can actually wind up lasting 1-2 hours... so it's no half-hearted slap-together event.  Very cool!  For those who enjoyed watching curling at the last winter Olympics, the curling in this game will prove to be well worth the price of the game.  For a fan who enjoyed the basic bowling provided with the system, I find the curling to now be one of my favorite wii events to play.",145,53

After having gone through all 15 games once I think the alpine skiing and bobsledding type games have the most replay value.  I have to agree that there is not much to the ice skating game; after playing it three times I don't think I will venture that way too often.  The downhill races, whether skiing or bobsledding, are a lot of fun and get my game adrenaline going.  I have now gotten the hang of skiing through the gates and am trying to get my 20 coins on the alpine super g when playing this game alone.  I lose at spider and bobsledding everytime, but mostly beat my better half in the down hill skiing.

The whole game itself iplays like Mario and Sonic at the Olympics, were you have the opportunity to do several games in sequence, or just pick one at a time. The controls are much more intuitive, so therefore the experience is more engaging and overall better.

You get to go to a woman's house, a town to explore, and you get to drive a boat and scooter!  You solve this game yourself and the game doesn't lead you other places automatically.  You have to find clues and converse with people before you go anywhere.  If I were you, I would definitely buy this game.  NOT A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

I liked this game. It was a bit longer than the last one and if you're familar with the mini-games, they really haven't changed. The story was better, and I have to admit, I had to locate a 'cheat' to figure out how the Grandfather clock worked.

For adults, this game is like a cheap novel; you can finish it in a few hours, its fun, requires very little brain-power and it takes your mind off of the real world.

Now I don't have to carry around multiple game cases and switch cards in and out. Simply flip a switch to select one of three games. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the unit could become disengaged from the DS player, causing you to lose your game progress. My solution?

However there is a MAJOR drawbacks! First I shall say that I used this on my 3DS XL. You cannot have a case on your DS with this plugged in the game slot. You CANNOT move your DS while playing your game because it clicks out of the slot VERY VERY easily! The games are very hard to get out of this thing! Which is awesome while the games are in their slots because you know that they won't fall out, but not great when you need to take a game out of it. It does weigh your DS down a bit, but is tolerable I suppose.

Only one shows up on the main screen, and there is a switch on the back to choose which one you want to play. The switch has just the right amount of resistance to prevent accidental sliding while playing a game.
However, the insert is spring loaded almost, you have to be REALLY careful, because any pressure on the game selector instead of the L or R buttons will cause the Game Selector to be ejected, and your game will be ended with no warning. Since I play games such as Animal Crossing and Pokemon, this ends my game, promptly erasing hours of data that i was too focused on to stop for 5 seconds and save.

The good: each seems to have its own unique personality and affinities characteristics.  The bad: the AI players often do not act in a rational or logical manner.  As with other iterations of Civilization, the AI players can go from being your friend to being your enemy and declaring war in one turn, and with no warning.

That playthrough called into question everything that is wrong with this game, and I don't recommend Beyond Earth in the slightest at this point.

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,Latest sci/fi Civilization  games installment from Sid Meier. Works on Win 7 systems.,13,38
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,Bought as a gift. My fiance enjoyed this installment in the series.,12,39
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"Best of the civilization games since Civ 2.  Still miss the throne room and wonder movies, would have given 5* if the devs would have given those back.  Far more detailed and interesting game then Civ5.  I expect those that think it's the same as Civ5 either haven't spent much time playing both or just don't bother with much thought or strategy in there play styles.  Easiest level players perhaps?  Great game, impressive tech tree.  Variable degrees of help from advisor very nice for experienced Civ players new to this game.",91,40
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,Basically Civ 5 with cosmetic changes; some of the diplomatic dialogue is identical to Civ 5.  Very disappointed.,18,41
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,Yet another great iteration of the Cavitation franchise.,8,42
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,Not nearly as fun as other CIV games but definitely more complicated.,12,43
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,A lot of fun to play for civ fans,9,44
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,this is crap I buy the Disk so I don't have to use a 3rd party program to play. and it says on box steam needed to install game.  no indication that steam needed to play game. yet clicking the icon opens steam (I had it closed deliberately) and game does not run without it.  this is false advertisement. by the packing licences on the outside of the box.  if i was going to buy as a download type program I would have gotten the better package for a discount on newer addon game it has.,96,45

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"I have been a Civ player since the old Dos days. This is a good game, with the classic Civilization style play. But it feels like something is missing. I've only been playing a few months, but I'll play this, then go back and play Civ V for a couple days. I just can't seem to get the Civ feel from this game like the classics all had, including V. I wish they would have made this as an add onto Civ V, so you could have moved into space from earth as you earned it, etc. True Civ style.",100,48
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,It was bought for a gift and the receiver loves it.,11,49
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,"This game is way less fun, and much less polished than Civ V.  If you already have Civ V, don't bother with Beyond Earth.  If you don't, buy Civ V instead - way more fun, cheaper.  Hugely disappointing.",38,50
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,"Civilization has to be one of my 10 favorite franchises over the past 30 years and has brought me possibly thousands of hours of entertainment and great memories.

This game honestly was disappointing and does not live up to the Civ name. It was tedious, lacked the depth of Civ V, and is really a watered-down, poorly done skin on Civ V. I wish I had never bought it.",69,51

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,"My wife loves this genre and this one is one of the best. Lots of actions and excitement (yes, she was excited!). She played Sid Meier's in PS3 for years and there were no new games.
If you love this genre, definitely try this one.
My only gripe is that the disc doesn't really work since Steam ignored it and download everything. It was a long install.",67,54
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,Disappointed as explained to shipper JAZZ but kept the game anyhow even though my Grandson did not want micro LEGOs.,20,55
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"would be an awesome game without the tracking and all around bad steam software application that you have to install and have running to use...but as it is mandatory...I cannot recommend a product that has to have a third party app even to run buy anything else but this. maybe the programmers will take note that offline games should not need and online part just to start and run and it takes up space , runs slow too bad as I own all the Cid meiers games. but this will be my last that I ever buy because of steam. fix this or lose another customer..i do not like having tracking software installed on my machine. turned in to antivirus makers as a malware app",125,56
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,"I expected more.  I was hoping for a really sophisticated universe-based game akin to the old Masters of Orion Games.  Instead, its almost exactly like other Civilization games with futuristic names and aliens instead of barbarians--really disappointing.

Another problem I have with Civilization games is they're all now Steam-based, even if you buy the CD/DVD version.  You can't even play the game without Internet and a Steam account.  One of the reasons I got into Civ games was they were playable when I didn't have access to the Internet as a fun way to pass time in a hotel or in other situations when Internet was not readily available.  Honestly, when the Internet is on, there's almost always something better to read/do/play.

I wouldn't buy this again, I doubt I'd play it on Steam even if it were free.  If it were playable offline, I'd give it 3 stars for fitting its niche where I needed it--but still failing to meet my expectations as a new game.",167,57
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"This is a re-hash of Civilization V with new skins for old game mechanics.  It is no great feat to beat the game, and a simple and nearly guaranteed path to victory is hard-coded into it.

But worse still, 2K/Firaxis has patched the game to the point that it is unplayable on many systems with NVidia graphics cards that exceeded the both the minimum and recommended requirements, and doesn't seem to care.  This is my LAST purchase of a 2K/Firaxis game, and I am submitting a request for a full and complete refund, as the implied warranty of merchantability has been voided by the manufacturer. . .",107,58
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"Seems kind of like a re-skin of Civ V, although I do like some of the new features such as the tech tree ""web"", affinities, trade routes, and unit upgrades",30,59
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,"Great game if you love the Civ series.  It really could have been called Civ 6: Alien Encounters :)

While the inability to stack units is still a bit weird, it doesn't detract from the game in any way.

I applaud the ""fit in with your environment"" aspect, but it is played a little heavy handedly by the other civilizations.  I've played through several times and don't ever remember one of the other Civ leaders saying ""Good thing you blasted those aliens out of the way.""  Thus I tend to build around the nests rather than over them.",98,60

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"Not a great CIV game compared to previous ones...nothing new or exciting, just some confusing new Tech tree and renaming of Countries to Corporations which land on a planet..

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"This game has not worked since it was received - it will not load although both computers we tried it on met all parameters. My son has tried to contact Steam regarding the issue and was directed to Twitter! No customer service whatsoever from 2K or Steam. They have released several ""patches"" that still don't address the problem.",58,63
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,Wasn't great.  Sid Meier's Civ lost something!  I have played them all.,12,64

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,"I've been addicted to the game since I've installed it. I am disappointed that the boxed version still requires Steam to run it though, but a great, fun game despite having to use Steam.",34,66
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"Weakest Civ game yet. It is not building on some of the best parts as the last few Civs. As a big Civ fan, I am sad to say this is the weakest game in the series. And it MOST definitely is not Alpha Centauri 2.",46,67
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,it was a huge dissapointment -this is not what one should expect from Sid,14,68
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"Such a basic game hard to believe waited so long for something like this. Graphic are good but otherwise can't say much for it and I've playing civ since civ2. Not many opponents,engineers, merchants, etc I'm used to in a civ game. I really can't believe Sid Meier put his name on this.",53,69
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"Similar concept to previous versions... I have to figure out the tech tree, kind of confusing and not a really good format to know HOW to pursue tech or military or cultural... you have discern it from the way it is presented and some of the options offered within each choice... just as addictive as V and other versions... On trades, you get 'favors', I have no idea how to call those up or when they are used or how... no good explanation on wonders so I keep 'wondering' if it is worth it and what will you get from it...

Don't regret the purchase, but not 'that' much better....",110,70
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,"Definitely a worth addition to the Sid Meyer's Civ games. More of a sequel to Alpha Centauri than Civilization V however. It is still very fun and adds quite an interesting new mix of game mechanics and playstyle options. I find myself playing this game very differently than how I normally play Civ 5 games, which is good. A must buy for any fan to the Civilization series, or Sid Meyer's games all together.",74,71
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,"Game would not install either by a too early game release or issues with the required STEAM site.
Too many problems.  Save your money until these bugs are removed.
I have worked with 2K to remove these issues.  Although they are helpful is this to be expected
following an expensive purchase?",51,72
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,5.0,positive,"It is more like an expansion pack than a new game.  Diplomacy functions much the same as Civ V with the addition of exchanging ""favors."" .  Also the spy interface is updated with more options.  I like the ability to terraform the landscape and the planetary resources are new and different.  Once you adjust to thelandscape you it will feel very much like you are playing Civ V.  Instead of barbarians there are aliens.  Instead of happiness there is health to contend with.  One of my favorite aspects of this game is the automatic unit upgrades as your technologies advance.  Take advantage of trade routes to have ample resources to support units and buildings.  The technology ""web"" is somewhat confusing though well thought out.  Good job overall.  Four new and interesting ways to win in addition to domination victory.",139,73
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,1.0,negative,Hidden on separate 'system requirements' page: Requires internet activation and patch download. Should have been listed both on the box and clearly stated on Amazon sales page. Fail to both 2k and Amazon.,33,74

Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,A large disappointment.  I had hoped that it would be in the style of his other games.,17,76
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,I have found the game to be counter productive. The aliens are very aggressive. They attack at every chance. Normally I would build up my defenses and defend myself or even wipe them out entirely. I haven't gotten that far but there are indications they are important later in the game and I should leave them alone. This takes a lot of enjoyment out of the game. Every time I try to explore or advance my Civ. the aliens are there to attack.,83,77

I would definitely recommend this game.",72,79
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"I absolutely loved Civ 5 and I was really looking forward to Beyond Earth.  I'm not disappointed with the game or with buying it at full price, but I do think that it still feels like a DLC.

Truthfully, I'd wait for it to go on sale before you pick it up in its current state.  There are some bugs (nothing breaking thankfully) and I think that more content needs to be available to really help it live up to bar set by Civ 5 and  the hours & hours you can spend there.",94,80
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,2.0,negative,"This is a preliminary rating.  I have attempted the game several times so far and was very pleased with the way it played and the concept of the game.  The graphics are rather blurry and dark, unlike previous versions.  The problem that I have with the game is that it could not be completed.  Twice I went all the way through the research  and in spite of have the requisite object in place for the victory for over 50 turns it would not complete the victory.  There was no way to get help on the 2K site though there was a page to ask for help, it would not allow me to enter anything.  I have been playing the Civilization games since the first and have found them enjoyable.  This may be only a problem with the type of victory I attempted so will keep trying.  If it works I may change the rating.",154,81
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"Fun. Mostly what you'd expect. Some new features, a lot of old features remain, yet had their names changed. Not enough work was put into the AI, although remains decent. 7.5/10.",31,82

Besides being stupid, I am not sure what the issues are.  My problems may be with Steam, which you have to use.  Other games I run through them work.  This one does not.  My computer meets tech requirements.  I have corresponded with them twice, but no answer beyond the automated FAQ response.  Black hole of tech support..  Others do not have this problem so............................  I give up for the time being..",102,83
Video_Games,B00JDP1AWU,4.0,positive,"Classics of the genre. Probably the most beautiful of all the games in the series, ""Civilization"", it is difficult to name a new subspecies of the series, most likely I would say about this game as a reincarnation of good old ""Alpha Centauri"" (fans will remember this game from Sid Meier). The game is very beautiful, with a nice initial videos, but the game is still buggy (sometimes by itself ""hangs"" (treated only by closing the process in Task Manager)).",80,84
