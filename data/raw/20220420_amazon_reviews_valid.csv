AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"The finish comes off SUPER easily, and the clasp is super hard to fasten the first time - then falls out after that.",23,0
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"my first time wearing a clicker in my septum and i absolutely love this clicker, fit my petite nose perfectly. i would purchase again",24,1
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"Didn't show up in 2 days,  like they were supposed to with prime shipping.  Got them about a week later.  And the bar is super loose, and really hard to click into the hole. I bought these for my diath peircing, and they are not going to work.  I think if i was using them for a septum, id have trouble getting them in that too. And,  in the picture they look black,  but are in fact a dark silver.",80,2
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,I have a little trouble getting clicker closed but do love the over all look. It does hang low but that is what I like about it.,27,3
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,It was really nice for the first couple of weeks. Sadly the clasp gave up too soon and wouldn't stay closed. Enjoyed it while it lasted.,26,4
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,The clasp broke after a few uses. Kind of a bummer since it looked great when it worked.,18,5
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"I LOVE this nose ring. It fits really snugly and it's super sturdy. Some people mentioned having issues getting it off. It can be a little difficult and I just used hemostats (or roach clips as some call them) to grip the bar and pull it out. So that was no issue for me. But I much prefer the piece being sturdy instead of falling out everytime I move my head. I get so many compliments on this ring, I would repuchase in a heartbeat.",85,6
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"This is the first septum ring I've ever bought that didn't turn green in my nose within a week so that's A+, only issue is that the hinge is really loose so you have to be really really careful while blowing/rubbing your nose and it makes it kind of difficult to put it in.",54,7
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,The clasp won't close and if you get it to close it pops open  immediately,15,8
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"Pros:
Feels light on the face
Looks good
Easy to put in

Con:
All the reviews about the clicker are true, it's sh*t. Broken by the next day after only replacing it maybe twice.",34,9
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,A little bigger then I usually like but I also have a tiny nose,14,10
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"I bought this clicker specifically to wear to a wedding in India, because it's way bigger/more showy than I normally wear. It was absolutely perfect for the occasion, and I liked it so much that I ended up wearing it the entire time during my three week trip. It held up pretty well despite me constantly playing with it and having to take it out a couple times for facials. By the time my trip was over, I noticed that the ""locking"" mechanism wasn't working as well, and that I couldn't play with or tug on the nose ring without it coming unclasped. Still, the clicker cost less than my average daily coffee purchases, so I'd say it's still a good value for the price.",125,11
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"Avoid! Item is not surgical or stainless steel, gold looks really fake, hinge is wobbly, and clasp doesn't stay shut. If you have a wide septum, the bad will not fit your nose comfortably. Returning for refund.",37,12
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,Looks as expected but where it's supposed to click doesn't do so appropriately so it comes undone often,18,13
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,Beautiful Tribal swirl septum clicker. Perfect and works well.,9,14
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"It's so cute and snug in my nose, it doesn't seem too sturdy but honestly you get what you pay for. I'm using this for one event one night, so as long as it holds out for that evening, I'm golden!",41,15
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"Nice look, tight fighting at the nose but comfortable",9,16
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"It was great the first time I wore it, now it won't click into place. It actually got stuck in my nose for a few minutes because it closed to the side of where it's actually supposed to. It looks like the hinge wore out already.",46,17
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,I bought this for my best friend for Christmas. She loves it. It fits her face perfectly and her best friend knows her so well haha. I would recommend it.,30,18
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"Since getting it it won't clasp or hold at all.  Even when its out in won't clasp.  Very cheaply made.  You get what you pay for, I guess but still not worth it.",33,19
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"Piece is tiny, it sits right up against my nose, making it stick out a bit. I would have preferred it hang like others photos. Clasp is firm, which is always nice, keeps it from coming loose. But the hinge is loose, it just flops all over the place, making it hard to get in. It sure is pretty though.",60,20
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,The nose ring would not come out of my nose..,10,21
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,Looks better in the picture. Almost looks like a plastic piece of jewelry you would get out of a quarter machine in person.. Also its way to small i almost couldn't even get it to click shut.,37,22
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"When the item arrived it was not the color shown. It is, in fact, much lighter almost silver. The clicker is very difficult and moves in other directions not just up and down into the slot. Still a beautiful septum ring, however. Happy with much purchase overall but the picture is misleading.",52,23
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,Much too small and it is not as dark as the picture.  It looks silver ti me.,17,24
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"Wasn't black first of all. It was more of a gun metal grey, which is fine except that it wasn't shown that way. The coating came off in less than a week and started to irritate my skin so I have already had to get rid of it.",48,25
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"Cute, lightweight, trendy, easy to insert and remove but hangs a bit loose in the septum making it feel like you have a runny nose.",25,26
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,This was great. Wore it for about two months before the clasp stopped holding closed. It's very very large though. The bottom rested on my lip. Not exactly comfortable,29,27
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"Flat top septums are no good, at least for me. I cannot wear them as long as I can wear a fully rounded clicker.. Worth the price but don't expect to be able to wear it constantly",37,28
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"This is one of the first clickers I have bought. I have heard some clickers are hard to close and particularly hard to open, but this one was really easy to open. The hinge is a little loose, but can easily be handled. I would buy a similar one from the same manufacture and would recommend to people. 10/10",59,29
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"The clicker part of it isn't stiff, making it hard to put in your nose. The actual ring of it I found too small for my nose as well. Was 3 weeks late for my shipping. It's cute though.",39,30
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"Very cute. Its not really black, more of a gun metal grey.",12,31
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,After wearing this for awhile the color wears off.,9,32
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"The quality is amazing, but is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, a lot. I was so unhappy with it that I gave it to my sister. It just wasn't suited for me personally, but it's a beautiful and high quality piece of body jewelry.",48,33
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,Straight hinges for septum huuurrttt so much. Can't keep it in longer than 5 minutes. Need something curved. It is very pretty though. Wish it didn't hurt so much.,29,34
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,Disaster. Had a bad allergic reaction. It's being sent back. Just got it Friday. Thumbs down. I'm allergic to nickel so I have to find surgical steel that's 100% nickel free. Oh and it turned green. Keep in mind I got it Friday April 8th and started noticing problems Sunday the 10th. Took it out on the 11th sent back on the 12th.,63,35
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,I love it. It was super super hard to get in the first time because the bar is very loose but once I finally got it in it fit perfectly and snapped in fine. It's hard to get out but not too bad. After opening and closing a few times the clicker became loose but all you have to do is push the circle part closer together.,67,36
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,Did not fit. Clasp too hard to open and close. Waste of money.,13,37
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"Fits fine, but it's not black. More of a dark grey.",11,38
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"Pretty decent piece of jewelry. Girlfriend uses it and she loves it. I recommend it for ""fancy"" occasions as its not really an everyday kind of ring.",27,39
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"Had to send it back. Once I got it in it wouldn't stay closed. Too bad, it would've been really pretty.",21,40
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,I'm not sure if this was delivered to the right house I haven't seen a package. I wanted this fir my daughter's birthday.,23,41
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"My package arrived today and I immediately put it in. It was a bit challenging to get open, but it only took a few minutes to get in and the clasp closed even with my long nails. I don't intend to take it out very often so hopefully I won't have any issues with the clasp wearing out. It is bigger than I'm used to, so it does feel a little huge at first. However I really like the look over all.",82,42
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"I really like it! It came earlier than expected and it's really cute! The only thing I have to complain about is that it is a bit large, but other than that, it's great and I would recommend it!",39,43
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"Cute at first sight. Lasted for 2 days. After I took it out and put it back in, the clicker didn't work any longer. The septum ring fell right out.",30,44
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"I love this peice so much! Easy to get in, feels very light. Great speedy seller!",16,45
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"A little snug but I like it and get lots of compliments. Seems slightly off center, but barely notice it.",20,46
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,This came in looking gigantic on my face. It is way to big and very unflattering.,16,47
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"I was not pleased at all, the inside diameter is to small to fit comfortably.  It's also to clunky to look pretty once in.",24,48
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,My wife bought this for herself and she loves it. She gets many complements about it,16,49
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"Its nice but it doesnt really fit my face, sadly. Still recommend tho!",13,50
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"If you but these cost it with Kamar Varinsh. It is a glossed used on costume jewelry, art, painting etc... It works great. Let dry for 2-5 hours. I say 2-4 at best. You should never purchase costume jewelry and not expect it to turn or cheap. You have to protect it.",52,51
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"Unfortunately the bar is not long enough to fit my septum. Very pretty, but won't work for me.",18,52
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,Cheap. As pic but teeeeeeerrrrrriiiiibbbbbbbbbbllllllleeeee quality. The snap doesn't stay.,10,53
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"I don't usually have an issue with any of the products i buy on Amazon, but my god how disappointed i was with this piercing. First its super cheap made and flimsy. Second it is nearly impossible to put in. And lastly i ordered it in black and received a silver one.",52,54
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,Its a pretty septum clicker but unfortunately for me it is too big and looks silly. My septum piercing is low so that could be why it's so big on my face. Hope this review helps!,36,55
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,"Item doesn't look like the item pictured what so ever it's not a terrible design, but it's absolutely not the same item as pictured. The hole is also very small, so it develops a lot of crusties.",37,56
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"Fits nice and snug! It's a bit abnoxious, perhaps that's why I love it so much. The filigree reached down to the top of my lips. The clicker is very easy to put in and take out.",37,57
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,latch can be a little janky but it looks so cute!,11,58
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,Total waste of money. I just got it in today and put it in. It went in fine but then it got stuck and I couldn't get the clasp open to take it back out. My work doesn't allow them and I work early in the morning so I had to go to a piercer at 11 at night and pay $10 for him to use pliers to pry the stupid thing out of my nose. So basically I'm never gonna put it back in and I wasted money buying this dumb thing.,93,59
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"I really like it.  It was easy to put in.  I haven't changed it yet, so I'm not sure how it will be to take out, but I love it!  I'm getting a lot of compliments on it.",38,60
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,"Shipped super fast, I love this ring, I get tons of compliments every time I wear it! It can be a little flimsy and tricky to get in though.",29,61
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,4,positive,Barely had it for a week. I've received a ton of compliments. I like it although it could be a bit too much for some people. My only complaint is that it can be a bit difficult to remove.,39,62
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,It's beautiful.. Too hard to open.. And I can't clip it closed  in my septum.. To short but I can work with it..,23,63
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,Very cheap quality. Turned green in my nose the first time I wore it. It also won't stay clasped.  Looks cute but you get what you pay for.,28,64
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,"I would give this zero stars if I could. Got it on time, but it wouldnt click in and then the bar on it flat out broke. A total waste of money!",32,65
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,Very dainty jewellery. but adorable on. I haven nto had it long so I'm sot sure if there are issues with the finish or anything like that but it is cute.,31,66
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,2,negative,Too large for the inside of my ear and cause pain. Hard to snap together,15,67
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,1,negative,The nose ring came broken. The pin was not attached to the ring itself.,14,68
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,Didn't have a problem closing and opening the clicker,9,69
AMAZON_FASHION,B014DQLPNC,5,positive,"Its a super slick in the septum... its the perfect size in my nose... its not hanguing there, its like fitted so its like super pretty... also the color is like rose gold super cute. I love it, ive had it for a couple of months and it hasbt worn out but i use it only on special occasions.",59,70
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4,positive,I USE THIS ON MY SUN DAMAGE BROWN SPOTS ON MY FACE WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO SEE NOW. TRYING IT ON MY HANDS NEXT. WILL BE NEEDING MORE.,29,0
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,Did not work for me. I finished 1 bottle and say no difference,13,1
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4,positive,This cream has a nice light citrus scent and it doesn't irritate my super-sensitive skin.  I've been using it on my face and neck every day for 2 weeks now.  I haven't seen any lightening yet but I like that it is light and not heavy on the face.  I'll keep using it and give an update after about 6 weeks to see if any lightening happens.,67,2
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,does not seem to work.  no visible difference after using for several weeks.  waste of money.  does not pump well.  have to keep bottle upside down to be able to pump product out,33,3
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5,positive,Works great for lightening those liver spots and evens skin tone.  Great product!  I will definitely reorder this product regularly!,20,4
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4,positive,I have been using this product for 6 weeks now have seen a big improvement. I use it for sunspots on my hand and have seen a significant change and I'm excited to see more change while continuing using this product. I would recommend this product for lightening sunspots.,49,5
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5,positive,"I recently purchased and began using this product. Within a few days, I started to notice a subtle glow to my skin. I enjoyed that this product was not at all heavy feeling when applied. It was very easy to add to my daily routine.",45,6
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5,positive,I'm using the product and I see some lightening of the dark spots.  I'm pleased with the cream and have had no irritation or redness.  It goes on smoothly and evenly.,31,7
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4,positive,This product works every bit as good as the Beverly hills MD product at half the price.,17,8
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,Does not works!!! Waste of money!!! Do not buy,9,9
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,I applied every day after washing my face clean. I have used the entire product. Results. Zero. Not even a hint of a change in skin color. It doesn't work period.,31,10
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4,positive,"Disclaimer: I received this product for review. Opinions expressed are completely my own.

I've been using this skin lightening cream for over a week now and I must say I really like it's hydrating ability. I have a couple dark spots from newer breakouts and uneven skin and although I have not seen much change in them since using the product, I feel that with future use I will see more results. The cream itself is white in color and is a little thick. It has a light, kind of tropical scent. I find it very energizing and gets me more awake in the morning due to the smell. The cream leaves a not too heavy feeling on the face. It is very moisturizing. The moisture lasts throughout the day. I like also that the product is natural with no parabens or sulfates. The bottle is bigger than most creams that I have seen which is nice and I am excited to use the product and see future results. Overall I think this is a good moisturizing cream, that has a great energizing scent and provides long lasting hydration.",189,11
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,2,negative,did not tone my skin as I expected,8,12
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,"Didn't do a thing for me and I have only light ""dark"" spots.",13,13
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4,positive,"Great product, haven't seen a huge difference, but do see some gradual changes in skin tone. Makes my skin feel smooth and less oily.",24,14
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5,positive,"I really like this product. It is not heavy and feels wonderful on my skin, leaving it smooth and fresh looking.",21,15
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5,positive,"My efforts at getting a tan with liquid Bronzers,was not successful, I looked closely at my skin and realized that my face looked really patchy. I was so pleased to find a Lightening Cream on Amazon and I restored my complection. Many thanks.",43,16
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5,positive,"This works.  I'm 75 years old and I use it twice a day, am and pm.  It has lightened the spots on my face.  Light makeup now covers them.  Of course, I always use sun screen.",36,17
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1,negative,"The 1.7fl oz that is claimed on bottle is actually fraudent. The bottle has less than 0.1 fl oz.
The whole quantity of the cream fits in that little middle bottle that is fitted inside the huge long bottle. Which is not 1.7fl oz by far. That's why the diptube is that short. (See images)
The product owners lie about the quantity and for sure they are lying about the quality of their product.
Give the positive reviews a second thought.",81,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,Kinda cheap and i got an ugly color not gonna be getting anymore. These are for toddlers,17,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,"Color that I received wasn't listed, but I still like it. It took a long while to arrive, but it was still cute when I received it. There's a wire going through the cloth so you can manipulate it all you like and it stays on fairly well. However, beware that when the wire breaks you basically have to throw it out or remove the wire.",66,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,"Love it, I wish you could choose the colors though. I received a polka dot black and white and polka dot teal and white.",24,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,This is cheap and a waste of money,8,3
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,This is nice i just wish i could choose the colors.,11,4
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,Really cute but was a different material than I expected it to be. I think it's satin.,17,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,You are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be a color listed. Not worth the money.,21,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,It's a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures. Material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it's supposed to be.,36,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2,negative,"I got some ugly funky color and while it looks cute on me, it's really small. I have a rather big head and so it doesn't reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model. It's also made of cheap wire so be careful with it.",53,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,I'm very disappoined. I ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material. What am I going to do with three of the exact same headband?,27,9
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,"it came a lot earlier than expected, I just wish I could've chosen the color of headband.",17,10
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,It's okay for the price got it sooner then expected wire started to poke out as soon as i put it on but easy to fix wish i could pick the color but i still love the one i got it is tan with orange dots,46,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,Do not like it at all. From the looks of the pic it was suppose to be one of the denim headbands and I received a light pink polka dot one. I have no use for it.,37,12
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4,positive,Very cute but i do wish I could've chose the color,11,13
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,"This is perfect for my daughter. She loves to collect this kind of headbands, and she's so happy!",18,14
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,This is a really nice headband to use whenever I'm washing make make-up before going to sleep.,17,15
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,Bought for my daughter. She mentioned that they were fantastic and she really liked them. The designs were girly and fit her style. I find them pretty too!,28,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5,positive,It came quickly and works great! I got one that was cream with dark pink polka dots!,17,17
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,All I'll say about this is I believe it's meant for kids . Not adults.,15,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1,negative,really thought these were coming as a set ....was really disappointed to receive 1 single head band...,17,19
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,"The maroon color is nice and the blue Isn't bad, but I won't use the other two now that I know that the magnet doesn't work. I was really sad to figure out it didn't work, but it still wasn't a bad price for the maroon and blue and they look okay without the magnet feature.",56,0
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,"I love the color and everything BUT when I opened it half of it was spilled EVERYWHERE! And I could only use the red and silver. Extremely disappointed. I love the other colors and it wears nicely, but I just really don't like the fact half of my order was unusable",51,1
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,I love the colors but the magnet did not work AT ALL!! Good thing I had ordered another magnet to go with these. I tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked.,39,2
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,"Problem wasn't with the polish itself, it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all. I tried everything so I am disappointed.",27,3
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,I recieved the package and they looked fine. I did not open the individual color boxes when I recieved it since it was a gift for my niece. When she opened them the next day one of the bolttle was broken from the top and color was leaking out and starting to dry already. The others worked great I just wish that the other one wasn't broken.,67,4
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,I don't recommend it. It's clumpy and hard to put on cleanly.,12,5
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,Love this magnetic polish. I have worn the silver/gray magnetic for just a day and already receiving complements on the shimmer.,21,6
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,"This product is terrible. I tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work, the polish is clumpy- like it has sand in it or something- so it can't be used as regular polish either. I tested the gold and the blue. Very very disappointed. I would have asked for a refund but I bought them awhile ago and am just now trying them.",67,7
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,The brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,"I got a  3D magnet gel polish. I tried them on my nails ( I work at nails salon and I know how to use that), the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality, seem they had sands inside and can't work at all, especially the silver and gold one. I will never buy it anymore. Bad and bad",63,9
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,"looks great and simple to apply.  Just hold the magnet for longer then the 10 seconds it recommends, roughly 30 seconds and it works nice.",25,10
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,I was so excited for these  polishes to arrive today. Unfortunately two of the four colors are unusable. They were  mostly dried  into a big clump. I even tried using gel thinner.  The other two colors worked great and the magnet worked perfectly on them.,45,11

All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4,positive,Beautiful colors. The cat eye doesn't seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me. I'll practice more. Update: after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4. I kept them in the original box all the time so it wasn't light that was cutting them.,59,14
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,"I purchased...came quickly. Two of the products look as if they had been previously opened, the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out. I give 2 stars, one for each good product, the blue and silver.",40,15
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2,negative,"I bought these solely for the star shaped magnet. I found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish. I'm going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if I can get the desired results. Still holding out hope on that. I cant give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is. Its lose, runny, and it pulls away from the nail horribly. By the time I was done applying it, the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that I eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing. And I STILL had bare spots. The formula is subpar! The only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately, which would end up being more time consuming. I don't recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure. So on top of the bare spots, I cant even see the start mark. I cant wait to scrape this off my nails!",180,16
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5,positive,"Initially I ordered this product and received a duplicate colour (ie: blue, red and two silvers instead of gold and silver). However, customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end I received all four colours.

All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1,negative,"I opened the package of the blue, which was completely sealed, took out the brush, and it was all wonky and clotted... I cleaned off the mess, and it was bubbly and lumpy, and the brush resembled toothbrush bristles.  It was impossible to get a nice semi-even coat of polish with this brush.  Then I tried the magnet, thinking, well at least I get a nice magnet from each of these.  Nope... didn't work.  The gold also was clotted and wonky (but not as much) and the brush stiff like a toothbrush, but the magnet worked on that one.  Still not a nice bold star pattern like on the box, but more like thin straight lines.  I don't want to open the other 2 right now because these are very smelly and I'm sensitive to that.  I purchased these a while ago, so it's past my return window, or these would definitely be going back.  The colors were great though.",160,25

Appliances,B0027E3FCC,5,positive,"I really like the design of these guards. They are L-shaped, rather than the other T shaped ones that I have seen. The advantage to this design is that your stovetop does not need to be exactly level with your counters for these to work.

The second time, the magnet started to stick/""melt"" to the stovetop and pulled away from the further-warping plastic. (There's still a bit of melted magnet residue on the side of my stove!)

Appliances,B0027E3FCC,1,negative,Thought the magnet would be great.  They are generic magnets (not neodymium).  I didn't think about the plastic needing to be heat resistant (DUH!) for my gas range.

After multiple cleanings, etc i saw a Best Buy sale and went looking for another Bosch.  The options in store were not great and this was the low end choice.  No adjustable shelf.  I decided this wasn't' worth the $300 difference.  Didn't notice there was no rinse only cycle until reading the instructions after installation.  Decided to just live with it.  So, first load had dried on cheese, other assorted rinsed in the sink by teenager stuff.  Used the 'Auto' setting.  This works great and have not worried since.  Have only had for a short time but would buy it again.  Is deep enough for pots and pans and Have not tried to put the wine glasses in the upper rack yet to gauge height.

Just follow the instructions and use some JetDry, and you won't have problems.

So far, a quality product. We'd definitely buy it again.",86,3

We had a need for something quick in a very busy time. I bought what CR and consumerresearch recommended. We've only done one load so far and it did clean the dishes well, but my two complaints are:

1. it's a funny internal design and unclear how you're supposed to put the dishes in, and how you're supposed to fit in big baking/ caserole dishes.

2. If you forgot to put something in for a load you can't stop the cycle and continue where it was, you have to stop the entire cycle and start all over again. very annoying. Whoever designed this clearly must not entertain much, because that seems to be a pretty common thing to have in every DW I've ever used, and is going to take a lot of getting used to.",140,5
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,"We have had our  Bosch dishwasher just over 2 years.  The sanitizer light stopped working a couple of weeks ago, and the dishwasher seemed to be working overtime - a longer cycle and unclean dishes at the end.  The repair main told us it was because the electronic circuit board had burnt out. Apparently the water coming into the dishwasher when it was turned on was not at maximum hotness, and so the dishwasher was having to work overtime to get the water to the correct temperature.  The dishwasher we had before for 20 years showed no such necessity, and I had never considered this requirement before - nor had I been told about it. Disappointing.",116,6
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,5,positive,We have owned this dishwasher a week and it seems excellent.  It cleans very well.  VERY well.  We do not rinse off food before loading.

I purchased it at Lowe's for a little less price.,69,7

It cleans great at first, and is quiet.  But the wheels are constantly falling off - we've lost 4 of the 8 of them.  When you pull out a full bottom rack it skittles across the dishwasher door and every time I worry that the whole thing will crash on the floor.

The water flows through jets in two different spinning arms.  The tiniest bit of food - often a scrap of lettuce or something unidentifiable - will get stuck in the jets. This signifiantly impacts cleaning. I struggle to pick it out with tweezers.  I DO rinse my dishes before loading them!",131,8
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,"I'd be interested to hear whether any of the other reviewers have had this problem, but a couple of months after installing this dishwasher, it started to smell terrible. After months of trying to keep the filter clean and living with the terrible odor, I called a repairman since it is still under warranty. He came and cleaned out the filter and sold me some dishwasher cleaner and told me that it is normal to have 1/4 inch of water under the filter after running the dishwasher. That is the source of the smell. He ran the dishwasher with the cleaner and a couple of hours later... still stinky! I've googled it and this seems to be very common to Bosch owners. I will absolutely never buy a Bosch dishwasher again.

Pros: *It does a decent job cleaning the dishes, though it's not perfect. There is often food stuck to the dishes after running.
Cons: *IT REEKS! *The dishes come out sopping wet unless you use Jet Dry, which is expensive. *It could definitely be roomier. My last dishwasher was a builder-grade basic one and I could fit a lot more dishes in it.",194,9

We exchanged the dishwasher for another one thinking and hoping that we had simply received a bad one the first time around. Unfortunately, the second one makes the same horrible noise. I can't believe no one else has complained about this. We even added a piece of foam behind the foot plate but it didn't dampen the noise enough.",106,10

It is a breeze to install,
You can adjust the amount of rinse agent used and you will probably HAVE to adjust it.

For the money a very nice washer. I am very pleased with the job it does and the low noise level.

Update 7/2/12

The dishwasher is VERY sensitive to food particles in the water. Be sure to rinse WELL before putting them in the washer.

Still love the dishwasher...

November 2, 2014

Still chugging away. Not a problem in any way.
update 8/7/2012

Had a problem with the washer not starting and having two blinking lights. Repairman came out on a warrantee call. He couldn't figure it out either. We finally soved it by turning off the circuit breaker and letting it sit for about 10 minutes. It started working normally then.

Appliances,B0053YL6LU,1,negative,"I own several apartments and have purchased and installed at least 15 dishwashers. This dishwasher replaced a 12 yr old whirlpool. It has several problems. 1) It stinks up the entire house. 2) the door pops open about seven times during a cycle-shutting the unit down. 3) It doesn't dry dishes. 4) cleaning is just OK. Not as good as the 12 yr old whirlpool it is replacing. After some research review sites, I have found several others complaining about the strong odor.  Many, many, many people are having the problem with door latch, it is improperly designed. In order to get the sound level down the frame is built out of plastic instead of metal, it flexes, the latch just barely holds door shut, one finger will open it. As it runs the thing flexes and the door pops open, takes longer than 24 hrs to run a load. In order to achieve energy star rating, they quit putting in drying elements. I guess ones suppose to hand dry. One would think after 12 years there would be some improvement. I certainly didn't know I would be going backwards",190,14
Appliances,B0053YL6LU,2,negative,"I purchased this dishwasher because of the Bosch name and my daughter-in-law has a Bosch.

Not through Amazon but from a local store.  I will not purchase another.  The best thing about this dishwasher is that it is extremely quiet.  However, it is small on the inside and would never do for a family.  The tines on both racks are positioned in such a way that it is very difficult to place dishes or glasses and cups.  The utensil basket is OK.  I like the piece that sections it so that spoons do not get stuck together.  The clincher for me is that after 2 years the main board went bad and it cost almost $300 to repair.  That's just for the part.  I had a Maytag in a different house that lasted over 5 years with no service.  I wish I could have brought it with me when I move.

The control panel is needlessly complicated compared to my old model. One needs to reselect the setting each load. And the rack layout is very frustrating. If I have a casserole dish to wash, it can only go in a place that blocks off the racks for the plates. The owners manual shows various ways of loading (only dishes) that are models of Teutonic order, but where are the casserole dishes? Kids's cereal bowls? Who lives like that? Also, should you have to open the door while it is cycling, you will get a face full of water from the upper jet. Also, the soap dispenser won't lock shut if you get even a small bit of dishwashing powder outside the tray. The springless door is not very user friendly, and the lower dish rack goes clanging off the tracks if you open it more than 3/4 of the way.

They have a leather compound...in a tiny, tiny container...you supposed to apply several times...Uhhh, how can you apply something so tiny, several times?  Then they have acrylic paint.

The sub-patch and leather patch were barely large enough for my repair.  Would it have been that difficult to make them a decent size?  The special leather adhesive was dried out and unusable - I used wood glue.  7 of the 9 leather filler colors were also old and almost solid.

However, the repair required considerable dexterity and care, and even after long trial-and-error I never could get the color correct, so  the repair is obvious. The kit could also benefit from additional backing material patches - only one is included in the kit and this effectively makes the kit suitable for one use only. But it was worth the price.",86,10

It is pretty darn close to perfect in fixing leather, though it would be nice to be able to dull it up a bit as it leaves a fairly shiny finish.  I've also used it for fixing plastic, rubber, etc.  It dries like a latex finish and can be peeled off carefully if you mess up.  Using a paintbrush to apply it in small spots works well too.

In my own case, it was a torn leather jacket.  I followed the instructions and wound up with a fix that was functional but looked cheesy and rough.  Part of the problem is, it's nearly impossible to get the color matched seal to look good if the repair is large.

It comes with an empty container to mix your colors in, and a mixing guide. They're so easy to mix to get a good color match. The instructions are easy to follow, and work perfectly if you do.

I covered the cut, let it dry overnight, covered it once more, and cleaned the area after it dried.

You cut the leather to fit the hole & thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth (I haven't tried tho). The hardest part is mixing the paint to match.  They have instructions for basic colors (ex: tan), but to get it to be the color you want is not for the faint of heart.  They might say, mix orange, yellow, white and brown.

Don't waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it. That's what I have and this was a waste of money.

The patching pieces (sub-material and the leather) were just too big to fit into the holes I have.

Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started.

*Plenty of colors of compound are provided, ensuring that the correct color can be mixed. Also I will be able to use this kit again if necessary (though I'll need to provide my own patch next time.)
*The materials are easy to work with if directions are followed.

Now, this doesn't look perfect on my leather chair. We had a large rip (about 4 inches.) I can see where the rip is. But our chair is a burgundy textured leather. Neither the color nor the texture is uniform, so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather.

If you have a glossy leather sofa like we do, don't waste your money; the product will look like you used black paint to cover scratches and holes. The texture samples given to ""re-texture"" a scratch or hole don't do a whole lot aside from smudge it around.. And good luck removing it when you don't like the color it dried as!!!

If you're careful it works really well to hide damage and to renew older furniture and shoes. Mixing colors is hard, and that's why a lot of people gave bad reviews: Because they didn't mix their colors and got mad that the color didn't match. You have to have the patience and artistic ability/dexterity to REALLY take your time with this, and to test carefully if color matching.

I bought this for black pieces, and the black paint works fine. You just have to be careful not to over-apply, and to wait for the glue layer to dry before applying color.

It's saved me almost $100 of new work shoes and an office chair!",150,59

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001E01TPK,1,negative,"This is a terrible product, especially considering the price.  First of all, the color paste is the patch.  If by some fortuitous circumstance you are able to match the color of the piece to be repaired, you had best hope it is not a hole larger than an inch.  If it is, forget it.  There simply isn't enough paste to patch.  Once 'patched' the repair material barely sticks, and the texturing process to allow it to blend in is poorly thought out.  Michelangelo resurrected could not manipulate this product into anything discreet.  Just buy colored duct tape or a new whatever you want patched.",104,76

And neither does my wife, which is a good thing.
I would practice with a color you won't be using on an item you don't care about, to get the hang of it. The directions are a little hard to understand and I had to read them 2 or 3 times to make sure I understood. Careful when applying the grain to get the proper side down.

I'm giving this 2 start because most people would not think to look at the reviews to get the correct instructions, they would simply do as I did and attempt the instructions that came with the product. That won't work at all. If you follow the correct instructions from the Avery site, you'll have a nice outcome with a pretty nice transfer. It comes out pretty soft and bright, not sticky like some transfers I've used in the past. I've washed the shirt I made a few times inside out, and it still looks almost like it did right after I made it.",140,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,"These were awesome. Easy to use and fun to make for gifts, family members.  Avery products are first class always.",20,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,"As mentioned already, the company screwed up completely on the directions... took me 10 minutes of trying to separate the transfer sheet to figure this out. Once you know how to apply these, they're actually very nice iron-ons. I've made a few shirts for my 5-year old daughter, who absolutely loves them. I've also transferred images onto bibs for my youngest daughter... amazingly, they've lasted quite a long time. Over several washings, they begin to wrinkle a bit, but as long as you dry them on low, they'll last a while. My wife accidentally dried one shirt on normal and the transfer ended up wrinkling a bit and looked like it had been through a dozen washings. Considering we've bought shirts from stores that have lasted less time, I'm very happy with these.",133,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,"I liked the 4x6 sheet size because I often print smaller-size images to iron-on to t-shirts and find I've wasted half the page.  I found it didn't ""peel"" easily after being ironed on, which is always a plus.  Avery has a high-quality product and if you're interested in making your own t-shirts, matching aprons for a cooking or gardening club, or memory quilts (custom onesies would make a perfect baby shower gift!) Great rainy-day activity to help kids design images on the computer and print out for an adult to iron on.",92,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,"As many reviewers have pointed out, the instructions included for this product are ridiculous.  I have tested this product on several white t-shirts (have not done any dark).  The actual use, once I figured it out, was fairly easy.  This was not a problem.  The real problem came in after a few wears and washes.  Of the three shirts I have made, I would say each have been worn and washed 3 or 4 times.  On all but one of them, the image has already started to crack apart and peel.  It could be that I did something wrong.  But, given the abysmal included instructions, I called the help line and followed their directions exactly.  So, my conclusion is this product needed a little more work before releasing it to the public.",132,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,"I had read the reviews of this product before purchasing so I was well aware that the directions included with the product were entirely wrong and disregarded them.  Thankfully users had posted better instructions and I was able to figure it out on my own for the most part.  I've only used this on white cotton t-shirts and although it is easy to apply (especially since I don't really care if it ruins our garage sale iron) the images have been breaking apart on the t-shirt material.  Since this is the main reason why I purchased the product the use of it has become null to me.  I'm not willing to shell out more money for nice t-shirts that I'll probably just ruin so these transfers will probably just go in a drawer somewhere in my house, never to be used again.",142,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,Really there is not much else to say it printed beautifully in my ink jet and transfered easily onto the garment. Fun product to use to create some original presents etc. Would deffinitely buy again.,35,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,"All you have to do is print the design you want and you're able to iron on the transfer. Works great! Only photo size, so if you want a larger picture, get bigger than 4x6.",35,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,"I always have a few packets of t-shirt transfers and some new t-shirts for impromptu projects.  I mainly use these to entertain kids (making team 1 & team 2 items), to add to a theme event (bridal shower toss pillow covers) or other random temporary projects.

As with most print-yourself iron-on transfers, the background is slightly shiny and non-stretchable and fades after several vigorous washings.  The item must be removed and lightly rinsed again by hand to avoid colour/print transfer to another part of the t-shirt.  In other words, don't leave the printed shirt sitting wet too long in the machine after washing.  As with items in this genre, this is purely a temporary, ""in the moment,"" item.  For something that lasts, I would recommend using the many professional printing services both online and brick & mortar.

My one major complaint is that the instructions are incorrect.  (Avery put the instructions for a different product in the packing).  Do not peel the transfer off the backing before printing.",168,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,5,positive,"Transfer stickes for t shirts have always been a great way to produce great gifts for party attendants, specially for kids birthday parties and to have an uniform look for family or group travel.
This stickes work great and I did not burn any transfering to t shirts. Only drawback is size may be a little small for large t shirts (adult X and XX sizes).",66,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,"I used these to make transfers for aprons for my family for our holiday family reunion.  They are really easy to use and were a huge hit with my family. I washed mine in cold water in the gentle cycle, drying on the lowest setting, and there was no real loss of detail or color. Just be sure to use a vibrant photo or image to transfer to insure that you get a quality image.",75,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,"I've used Avery transfers for inkjet printers before. Instead of having t-shirts printed for employees who come and go and mistreat the ones I've bought and had screen-printed, I have often opted to print our logo with these transfers. I think this latest batch I got is slightly more resistant to fading in the washing/drying process. I suppose I'll know better a month or two from now, but so far they seem better. Same good performance as far as ink color accuracy and consistently even transfer of image.

Two months later - the images I printed continue to wear well through the laundry process. The two concerns anyone may have about using these transfers have now both been put to rest for me: the image is intense and evenly printed; the image stays that way much more than it would have with previous editions of the transfer. Try some.",149,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,"This photo transfer paper works great. I am not using it for T-shirts, but the wife wanted to start a memory quilt. I took several photos that I had archived and using this paper, printed them from my Canon printer. The iron on transfer to the cloth she is using went perfectly and she is extremely happy with the results. It looks as if I will be ordering quite a bit more of this so she can finish her quilt.",80,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,4,positive,"These are great for my 3 yr old's t-shirts.  They fit perfectly on the shirts and I don't have problems with them often.  I had one that was hard to get the sheet off the shirt but I honestly don't know if I just didn't push hard enough or iron it for long enough so I can't say it wasn't my fault. (although, nothing is ever MY fault, ask my 12 yr old.  LOL)
I'd buy these, definitely!",78,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,"There were a lot of problems w/ this product. First of which were the directions that were completely baffling. The other was the product itself. There were problems w/ printing it on my printer, then w/ tranferring it on the shirt, and then w/ washing.

I would not recommend this product. It was too much of a hassle to work w/ and poor intstructions.",64,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,"As others have posted, trying to follow the directions that come with these is mind boggling.  After several attempts to figure it out, I actually came to amazon to see the reviews and found I was not alone.  My wife is an art teacher and usally can figure things like this out much better than me so she will be playing with thiese next.  All I want to do is make a custom t-shirt for my 4 year old.  It shouldn't be this confusing!",84,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,"It didn't even work in the printer. Went in, came out, didn't do anything. Just got new printer, will test it and update review if a success but from the looks of it it probably won't be. The directions- it says ""avery dark fabric transfer tips""- What about light colors?- and the directions from there on are shabby. As in they're muddled. I'm not even sure the directions in the package are even correct.

The only plus I can see so far is the support line. A support line for t-shirt transfers...isn't it supposed to be easy?",97,22

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,"I usually don't write bad reviews, but this was such a disappointment and a waste of money.

I used it to put images on two white cotton onesies - it says right on the package ""ideal for children's clothes."" The transfer attached the white backing to the shirt, as well as the image, unlike other light t-shirt transfers I've used in the past, but I figured it would be ok. Nope! After one wearing, I rinsed them both in cold water in the sink, and the ink ran terribly. Nearly all the red just washed right off. Ugh. But still, I'm not wasting onesies, so I just dropped them in the wash. After only one wash with the rest of the baby clothes, the transfer is ripping and torn, and looks like garbage.

This is the worst iron-on transfer I've ever used. Avery, you let me down.",147,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1,negative,This product is junk. I only use Jet Pro Soft Stretch. This stuff cracks and the colors are not nearly as nice as the Jet Pro. You do have to use an actual heat press with the JPSS though.,39,25

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,2,negative,"I love customizing things, fabric is no exception, so when these popped up I was sure to grab them.

I was discouraged upon attempting to do my first transfer because the instructions made no sense. In fact, they were completely incorrect. The instructions say that the transfers are for dark fabrics, but the sheets say for light fabrics.

After eventually getting this to work I found out that that you cannot dry the fabrics on anything other than low (which is fine with me, I dry everything on low to keep them soft).

They're really no better than any other iron on transfers. I won't be purchasing these again, but if Avery comes out with a new and improved transfer I will consider it. Hopefully they've taken all of these reviews to heart.",133,27

Secondly, I've never experienced drawing with something that doesn't remotely match the color of the cap! It's like a surprise every time. The light colors are dark, the five different greens are all roughly the same color. The yellows are orange or green...and they have run out quickly.
On the plus side, the case is nice and I like the triangular shape, and the price was cheap!",76,13

I used them only for a school year if that's a while, but some of the colors dry out faster than others. once a pen has been bent or split there's no going back. That was the only sad part about these pens.",54,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4,positive,"These are a very nice fine tipped pen. Work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in. There are plenty of colors , but I did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper. there was only 1 pen that I had any issue with and it was a light green which didn't bother me that much since I don't use a lot of the lighter green colors. But by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let the color ""drop"" and I haven't had any issue since. the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight, but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing.  The colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you won't lose them anywhere. I am attaching a copy of a picture that I am working on right now , using these pens for the linework , the wording is done with a marker.
I received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review.",203,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,I bought these to use for adult coloring books. And a lot of people end up using colored pencils but I wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick. Is a great variety of colors and it's very sharp clear bright pigmentation. I'd recommend this to anybod. so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book. I'm not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I'll probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,"Horrible.  Ink flow is blotchy and uneven and the tips of some of the pens are slightly frayed and too hard to make a nice smooth layer of color.  Also these are listed as Pinkrise and they are Plinrise... for some unknown reason.  If you have arthritis or fibromyalgia the caps can be difficult to remove.  The triangular shape is pleasing to the hands, though.",65,73
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,Some pens were already dry and unusable - very disappointing. Got much better pens at Michaels.,16,74
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,"I love to write and draw, and I am always on the lookout for some great pens and markers.  I am so glad I got these Pinkrise Office Colored Fineliner Sketch Drawing Pen,fine Point Gel Ink Pen ,Ink Width 0.4mm,set of 24 Assorted Colors.  They are very nice, and come in a plastic case that seals nicely, so when you are done, you can put them away very neatly and not lose any of them.  And they write just wonderfully!

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1,negative,Not only are they dried up( and yes I did shake them and wait a while to use them) but some of the tips are split down the middle. The colors on the caps are not even close to what the actual ink comes out.,45,86
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5,positive,"These are great for very detailed drawings.  The ink seems to stay consistent, even after prolonged use.  Also, the barrel is triangular, rather than round.  I found it a little awkward at first but it certainly didn't cause any issues.

These would be a great gift for an artist or other creative type, maybe paired with an art book.

Regarding shipping, I have Prime and it arrived within 2 days.",70,87

Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,"Thought I was looking for a filter, but turned out it was a missing muffler on a friends wet dry vacuum.  DId the job and returned to my friend with added bonus because she didn't know it was missing.",39,2
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,"This installs easily on the Rigid vacuum exhaust port, but that's about the only good thing about it.  It is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it.  I could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not.  It's a good idea, but really doesn't work too well.",60,3
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,"This product being advertised as a 'muffler' is misleading. I observed no difference in sound level.  I just completed my test.  It is being returned.  An effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac.  This is a viable option for my use, since I will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective.",77,4
Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,The listing for this muffler doesn't say what size hose it fits.  There are three sizes.  When I received it I realized it didn't fit my vacuum.,27,5
Automotive,B0000302TY,2,negative,"My Ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106dB at 3 feet.  According to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a Dead Kennedys concert.

The ""muffler"" reduces that to 105--so maybe a Wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler. Further, using an unscientific ""stick to your face"" test, I'd say it reduces suction by about 15%.

So basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac.  If you need that (and don't want to just tape a sock to the outlet) click ""buy"" immediately.

I finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet.  Now I can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her F-16.",124,6

Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,"I didn't need exhaust dispersion.  If I did I would have tried to find an exhaust dispersion device (To my knowledge none exist).  I wanted a muffler.  This doesn't muffle. I took it back.  The End

PS This site won't allow my 'zero star' rating.",45,8
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,This not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine doesn't blow air all over from the back of the machine!  It is a great addition for very little money.  We were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list.,50,9
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,"I was surprised to see that this 'muffler' received 4 stars. When I read the reviews, praise was given not because it muffles sound, but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust. Indeed, this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my Ridgid vacs. (I bought two of them, but I was in a rush and got them locally.)

When we are working on a job site, there often is lots of dust. Imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place. Not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in, it also spreads the dust over an even greater area. As other reviewers describe, this 'muffler' -- oh, why not just call it 'air-diffuser' -- redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle. This greatly reduces the force of the air.

It is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler, but the difference is too small to spend any money on. So in terms of living up to its name, I give it one star.",190,10
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,This little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac.  The name is rather misleading as it wasn't designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction.,40,11
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,"If you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place. If you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust, this is what you need. It can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust.",44,12
Automotive,B0000302TY,1,negative,"This is definitely not a noise muffler. It's not a silencer either. It does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face. By redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable. I bought this for our new Ridgid WD1680, which Amazon doesn't sell. The big box store I bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so I got this to go with it. Used in a garage, the vac is surprisingly quiet. It seems our Hoover upright is much louder. I measured the Ridgid as-is at 83dB. With the 'muffler' on, it was 83dB. There was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant. I figure it's also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I'm going to return it. The WD1680 also works as a removeable blower. In that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port, even though it was the same port with just a tube attachment. So bottom line is that this is useless.",182,13
Automotive,B0000302TY,5,positive,"Worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart.  This really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern, and also diffusing it with some very porous foam.  Vacuum performance is not hindered.

It's not really a ""muffler"" as the noise level did not change for me, but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying.  It should really come with the vacuum, but since it doesn't, it's a no brainer purchase.",82,14
Automotive,B0000302TY,4,positive,"I bought this item for the Rigid shop vac with detachable blower(basically the same unit as the Sears Craftsman version).  It makes a noticable difference in reducing the FREQUENCY of the sound, thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit.  Although I can't say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter( I don't have a dB meter), it certainly makes it seem quieter and MUCH more bearable.  You do have to watch where you point it though because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction (although this is by design, it is the blower port after all.  Also it not fully inserted, it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on.  Worth the money!",130,15

This works. Mount is good as well. Took me a minute to figure it out and needs tightened every once in a while.

Mirror with a few imperfections, but certainly good enough view to see if a skier or tuner is on or off, and to see hand signals.

Automotive,B0000WZLPM,1,negative,The cargo gate would be fine for very light weight loads but just a simple 5 gal can of gas will cause the bottom to push in towards the cab if you try an secure your load against the tail gate it works fine until you tap your breaks then the bottom of the gate will swing towards the front of your truck,63,5

Now that a calmer head has prevailed, the cargo gate went right in as described. I anticipate that it will hold my travel bags and dog travel supplies close to the tailgate on an impending road trip. I would not depend on it to hold a very large and heavy object in place but if you want ordinary things like groceries, luggage etc to stay within reach. I'm confident this is the perfect solution.",120,15

Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,These are not custom fit. You cut them with scissors and they sort of fit. Not that impressive. The back ones are dual non-fitting. Landcruiser has a single piece. Go with Weathertech.,32,10
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2,negative,"Update- I contacted Husky about these mats and the poor fit in my toyota highlander. Outstanding customer service. Engineer admitted these are more of a general purpose mat and not specifically designed for one model of vehicle. Instead, he shipped me the ""cargo liner"" mats which are custom molded to cover the entire floor in front of the driver and passenger. The custom fit liners are FAR better . If you drive a highlander or larger vehicle, choose the custom liner and skip this mat.

(Original review) I drive a 2006 highlander and was happy to see that my specific model was listed. Unfortunately, these floor mats are anything but vehicle specific. The Husky website tells you that they will require ""trimming"" and even after doing so, the driver side mat does not fit correctly. This is a safety hazard and I strongly recommend against this product. Save your monay and shop elsewhere.",153,11
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,"WeatherTech makes the Digital fit for the 2004 Tacoma, but NOT the double cab. I bought those mats from amazon because their fit guide said it would work. When they didn't sit right, I went to their Weathertech's site and learned that they don't make the mats for the double cab truck. You can submit a product request on that site, and tell them you want that this mat made. Once there are enough requests, they'll make it.
If you are buying these mats because you don't want to spend the $100+ that Weathertech charges, then you may be satisfied. If you've ever owned the WT mats, these are no where near the fit. Since they were 60% of the cost of the WT mats, I'm not disappointed.",128,12

Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4,positive,"I've had several Husky heavy duty floor mats in the past.  I prefer the Heavy duty to the Hskey liners in the front as they are less slippery and thicker.  Normally they fit great and last forever.  I bought this set for my 2004 Tacoma Double cab (1st Gen).  The fit leaves something to be desired.  Initially the driver's side was terrible, but there are pattern lines for trimming it down.  After trimming with a razor, it's a good fit.  I'm not sure if this is for multiple models, but I would prefer a fit out of the box.  The passenger side needs to be molded differently on the bottom left corner, as it comes up over a bump in the floorboard.

Colour is great match.  Materials quality is great, and I'm sure they will last as long as my other Husky's have.  Just a bit disappointed in the passenger side fit.  It's not terrible by any means, but not perfect as others have been.  Driver side is perfect after trimming with a razor blade along the trim lines.",179,21
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5,positive,"After hitting some ice and tearing up my front fender I decided to buy these to cover the damage. They worked great and fit like a glove. No sweat on the tape... I just used clear silicone via caulk gun to attach. Nothing to it. One thing to note... these attach behind the front running lights via screws. In other words, you remove your front running lights, then replace atop the fender covers back to the holes. The screws in the kit were just a little short and not really up to the task. I went to the auto store and purchased some stainless #8 screws with plenty of length to tighten up everything.

These look great on the jeep. I also have real diamond plate installed and the guards matches just fine!",133,0
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2,negative,"If you buy these, you WILL need to trim these and take your time to make them fit correctly. I had to use a Dremel to shave down the sides for both sides to sit flush. Then, I had to use a heat gun to heat them up and mold them to the fenders so they would sit right.

Go to Lowes or Home Depot and buy stainless steel screws. The ones they provide will not work correctly. You will want to use a pan head screw. Head size #8 and 1"" long.

Go to your local auto parts store and pick up a small roll of 3M double sided tape (has a red backing and the adhesive is a dark gray). The provided tape won't be enough to hold it down right.

Overall; not a terrible product, but for a $50 molded piece of plastic, I would have expected it to fit better.",154,1
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4,positive,"The front is much easier than the back. Lights come out easily and the fit is pretty good.
I read a review that said it didn't come with new screws and the ones you take out of your lights aren't long enough. I didn't see any when looking at the parts so I went and bought some but later when cleaning up, I found a little bag with 4 black screws in it and taped to another bag the parts came in. Never saw that. lol  I assume these were for that but I did the front and backs at the same time so can't swear to it.
Again, instructions would have been nice.
They look great!",117,2

Automotive,B000FQ033I,2,negative,"These guards look great in the pictures but for the money they are way over priced.  Here is a list of things that could be improved on these that I created while installing these.

1.  Better tape.  I'm not sure why Rugged Ridge skimped on the tape for these but after installing the left gard as per the instructions it literally popped off.  I went down to Kragen and got the best 3m tape they had and the guard fits flush just fine.

2.  Quality control.  For 50 plus dollars I would consider these a disappointment.  The plastic was unevenly cut was thin in some areas particularly where the screrws go.  The mold might have been crooked because the screw holes were also a little uneven.

3.  Heavier duty.  I know plastic is very strong but I was definitely disappointed with the weight and feel of the plastic as well considering the price.  For 20 dollars I doubt I would have said anything but for triple that and more on other websites I was pretty annoyed.  Definitely considered returning them

They do look nice once you get them on.",189,6

Can still install using a bolthole from passenger grab bar, just one screw, about 1 inch, sheet metal type. If tight enough,
 this one screw will secure cupholder pretty well. Holder just ok, plastic with significant flex or bounce: no top on the

Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,"This is a great idea but with it installed, you can no longer open the wing window. Its kind of a bummer because i use the window quite a bit. i am going to mount it using some self tapping screws away from the window so i can use them both at the same time.",55,78
Automotive,B000FQ7BFG,2,negative,These exact holders used to be made from metal. I wish I'd seen they cheapened the product and now make them from plastic.

Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,I like these seat covers a lot. I mainly got them to protect my light covered seats. I didn't really care for the colors. But they are very useful.

Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,These seat lovers are nice enough but the problem is that the backseat covers do not fit a 2014 Toyota Camry. This Camry has airbags in the rear that should not be covered.,33,8
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4,positive,These seat covers are pretty darn cool actually.  It was not that difficult to install at all.  The only complain is that it doesn't quite fit my back seats. There is no opening in the seat cover for the center consul of the back seat.,45,9

Books,7487223,5,positive,"Charles Cumming's ""The Hidden Man"" is certainly the finest espionage novel I've read.  While I love the works of Littell, Deighton, Greene, McCarry, Ignatius and Le Carre, as well as Cumming's own ""A Spy By Nature,"" ""The Hidden Man"" is unique in how effectively it deals with the effects of cold war espionage on very ordinary people.  The main characters in Cumming's novel are not spies, ambassadors or diplomats, but a businessman and an artist.  Nor does Cumming succumb to having them turn into James Bond.  History simply reaches into their lives, and unravels them.  Even one is not interested in that particular theme, one will be treated to a fast, engrossing drama.  By page fifty, Cumming has amassed so much intruiging plot with remarkably little prose.",127,0

It is a tense, satisfying story of dysfunctional father-son and brother-brother relationships that become enmeshed in an MI5 investigation into a Russian organized crime family. As anyone who has ever read any of Gerald Seymour's books knows, whenever amateurs get involved in the world of espionage and organised crime, the outcome is rarely a happy one. You hope that they will emerge safely, but deep down you know that they won't. Once you know that this is one of Cumming's early efforts, you do feel that the degree of cynicism that comes through in his Alec Milius stories is still in its early stages of development here, but the way in which MI5 and MI6 fail to even talk to each other, let alone cooperate, and the fatal consequences this has feels all too real.

The novel suggests how different characters in 21st century Bushwick, Brooklyn, adjust to such an environment.  Some find escape through alcohol and other drugs; one longs for a kind of transcendence, a need to believe that there is a power out there that is aware of what we do; some try to stay forever young; one considers suicide.  The best we can do is follow the example of the two brothers, now middle-aged, at the center of the novel, who look out for one another.

Set in NYC, this contemporary tale follows the lives of two brothers who are very different from each other and yet, very closely connected. Cunningham is a master at breathing life into his characters; each one unique, original, deeply flawed and totally sympathetic. I've read all his books, and this one is a favorite, in some ways reminiscent of The Hours. The author's intertwining of his characters' less-than-perfect (and often painful) lives, carries the reader through the difficult, sad events of the story. These people are bound to each other by a profound love and caring for one another. And also, by a communal sense of hope (which I interpreted as a metaphor for the childhood belief in the existence of a benevolent Snow Queen.)",148,24

It felt like being at a party and thinking is there anyone in the room I might enjoy. Yet, I stayed with The Snow Queen and was glad I did. Michael Cunningham did a great job of depicting New York in the beginning of the 21st century and of making his characters come to life (if not to like, but I wrote that already). I also enjoy the way he writes dialogue. My only (in my eyes, major criticism) is his choice of vocabulary. I found myself asking, ""Couldn't it have been a little less pretentious?""",118,45

A time-snap: Their mother reclines on the sofa (which is here now, right here in their Bushwick living room), smoking, cheerfully bleary on a few old-fashioneds (Barret likes her best when she drinks -- it emphasizes her aspect of extravagant and knowing defeat; the wry, amused carelessness she lacks when sober, when she's forced by too much clarity to remember that a life of regal disappointment, while painful, is also Chekhovian; grave and rather grand). Barrett is nine. His mother looks at him with drink-sparked eyes, smiles knowingly, as if she's got a pet leopard lying at her feet, and says ""You're going to have to watch out for your older brother, you know.""

Im not familiar with Michael Cunningham writing, (I only saw the movie, The Hours) and the middle of the book the writing wasn't too bad. There were moments I wondered if I would bump this book up from what I had categorized it as just tolerating it. But, towards the end the novel definitely waned.  Physically, it is a short book, but it is not short. Cunningham is a sophisticated writer, but the book was almost too metaphorical for me. It reminded me, of play/book The Raisin in the Sun Which wasn't one of my favorite bookstoo much symbolism and the mundane set of character in the same dreary setting throughout, most of the book. It did not inspire me, I would not recommend this book.",162,67

Well, sad to say, I did pay a lot for this book (in my opinion), and I kept reading it after I got home, hoping that maybe it was one of these situations that sorted itself out as you read along. Not the case for me. My expectation was... well, I don't know now what it was- I guess I thought that if I had ""seen the light"" that I would have made some sort of change in my life, or, that at least if an author was going to write about an experience like this, that we would have been able to hear about a change.

Set in hip Brooklyn, the novel presents the contemporary life of a closely knit non-traditional family.

Barrett and Beth work together in the vintage shop of another character Liz, whose current paramour is more than twenty years her junior. Theres a yearning among all these characters for coolness and meaning, yet their behavior remains more adolescent than adult. After being dumped by another boyfriend, Barrett pauses in the park to look up and observes a light than both captures his attention and disturbs him. Is this the light that erases the feelings of darkness? Beths cancer draws all the characters away from themselves and toward understanding.

His words are exquisite, evocative, and selected with precision His mid-2000s Brooklyn is depicted with all its tedium, charm, and grit. His characters, although flawed, are sympathetic. This is not a novel of immense action, lofty ideas, or seismic moral teachings. It is much more a slice-of-life tale, albeit seasoned with dashes of mysticism, spirituality, and pathos. A great read.",86,83

It's turned reading into plodding. I'll keep going as long as I can but I fear it's not going to get any better. Very sad, since I have enjoyed most of his previous books very much.

It may just be that, where William Gibson and  Neal Stephenson get to make it all up, Clancy & Pieczenik aren't making  as drastic a leap forward.
A solid premise and interesting concepts as  The Selkie suffer from limited exploration, and even the villain seems a  bit cardboard. A smattering of technical errors (Michael's instead of  Michaels', virgil instead of VIRGIL, among others) distract the eye from  the presentation, making it seem like the book was rushed out the door to  coincide with the ABC Made-For-Television production.

No real insight into the technology just pure fantasy on  every level. When the 2nd degree black belt man meets the small ""well  trained"" women, can you guess who gets beaten thoroughly?

  Many if not most of Clancy's stand alone novels are rightly ranked in the five star range.  This one comes up only to a below average for the genre two stars.

Some of the characters are interesting, like the Russian fellow who had a great subplot going, but even his ending is a letdown. The 2 main love stories are tiresome, detract from the main plot, and take up way too much ink. The virtual reality subplot is a leap of faith.
Not worth reading.

Books,60746955,4,positive,"Tom Clancy is an amazing author.  We have begun to expect thrilling novels from him.  Net Force is just a step above the rest.
 The book begins with the assassination of Michael Day, the head of Net Force.  Net Force is the governments computer control agency, believed by some to be ore powerful than the FBI and CIA.  The assassination is the spider in the web of events leading to the exciting conclusion.  There are five main characters in this novel: The Selkie, who is an assassin trying to take out the replacement head of Net Force, Plekhanov, who is trying to take over Ukraine, Alex Michaels, who is the new head of Net Force, and Toni Fiorella, the martial arts master.
 This book has some very thrilling moments like ""Ruzhyo placed the wavering crosshairs on the mans chest"" and ""He turned and saw the old lady with her cane held over her shoulder like a baseball bat, ready to belt his head into the bleachers."" are just some of them.
 I suggest you read this literary masterpiece, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.",188,44

This book got me to read again, before I thought that I would never find a book that could give me the pleasure of adventure but then a friend gave me Net Force and I fell in love with it. It reminded me of how fun reading can be who wouldn't call a book dealing with computers causing famine, chaos and death awesome and cyber terrorists crashing mainframes across the world. ""Who ever controls computers controll the world"" that has been true for the last 3 decades and computers are only getting started.

The way in which  Tom describes the advancement of technology and the importance of internet  security still captures my imagination some years know since reading it.  the action is fast paced and revolves around three storyline angles.

The selkie the  daughter of an IRA hitman who was murderd before her childhood eyes makes  you do nothing but fear and admire her. the book certainly makes you whant  to read and read if you are interested in this area but if your not into  computers as such there is still plenty of other lead elements to keep you  on the edge of you respective.",204,57

I work in the field of technology and computers.  True the Net Force Book is FICTION (some reviewers may need a dictionary to understand that word)  But it is not far fetched.  I have seen similar technology  being used today.  Look what 10 years of refinement has done for computer  storage media.  That kind of a jump can happen in VR netware in there is an  external influence which drives it.
The book itself was excellent...the  relationships between Toni and Alex as well as Tyrone and Bella were right  on the money.  Sgt. Frenendez and Col. Howard gave it the guts or glory  energy it needed.

Also this  futuristic nonsense is at best interesting and i would say boring. Where's  the action? Where's the thrill? Where's the suspense?  Clint Eastwood was  an A1 actor and all his western films & Dirty Harry films were A1. Then  he had to get all 'arty' on us and try to do what he is not best at  (directing) and the films he stars in are just OK - not great. Tom Clancy  is following in these steps with Net Force and to a degree Op-Centre.

Interest in the case has been raised because someone else has been murdered in the same fashion and found in the trunk of their Mercedes.

Faye Kellerman always writes a well plotted, interesting mystery and The Mercedes Coffin is no exception. I enjoy reading about the Decker and Lazarus family as much as I enjoy the mystery. The only fault I found with this book is that Rina Lazarus did not play as important a role in this book as she has in others I've read.

Detective Peter Decker is assigned to the task, and he quickly becomes involved in both cases (with a little assistance from his detective daughter Cindy).  The task becomes complicated  with additional murders, especially those of one of the original detectives.

As entertaining as the novel is, it is intriguing in its composition, keeping the reader perplexed amid the lies, deceptions and relationships among the cast of characters.

Halfway through the book the author is still introducing more characters. You'll need a scorecard to keep track. She also gets heavily into the members & secondary characters of a punk rock band. Yep, no kidding.
The dialogue becomes very repetitive & boring. There are no twists at the end. The ending just shows up. It just didn't matter. By the time Ms. Kellerman decided to end this travesty, I just did not care who did it or why.

Ms. Kellerman would have done well to drastically cut the length & characters to make this into a short story. In it's present form, it's tedious at best",144,50

Having just finished it, about the only thing I remember is that Peter was married to the always perfect Rina.

Books,61227374,4,positive,"Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus Series

As the seventeenth Faye Kellerman book in the Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus series, The Mercedes Coffin was a complex book that addressed the current exercise of solving of cold cases.  As someone that is very interested in the Jewish faith, I was a little disappointed that we did not see more of Rina in this book.

The story line has Peter investigating a 15 year old file of the murder of Dr. Ben Little, a school VIP.  His department was asked to look into the case because of a request received from a very wealthy woman who promises great things as a reward. When a second victim is also found in the truck of his Mercedes, there appears to be a tie-in to the previous unsolved murder.

Faye Kellerman's books always have twists and turns and solving this mystery is very complicated and takes thinking outside the box.  You must pay attention to what every person says who is questioned. The clues are there hidden in their statements.

As a fan of Faye Kellerman's Decker and Lazarus series, I look forward to her next book.",192,56
Books,61227374,1,negative,"As other reviewers have noted, Faye Kellerman's latest should, at best, be checked out from the library or borrowed from a friend. It really is that bad.

I'm glad that I'm a fast reader and didn't mind wasting a sick-at-home afternoon on a mystery that wasn't much of a mystery, with characters you remember liking -- but in this outing having difficulty remembering why -- and a plot that felt like the product of a bad computer program.

It's understandable that Kellerman could be running out of steam on her Decker-Lazarus series. There've been enough of them.

Still, if you were to read the dust jacket blurb,  ""A cold case turns red hot threatening to consume everyone it touches -- including L.A.P.D. detective Peter Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus -- in the spellbinding new thriller...,"" you'd have to wonder if the blurb writer read the same book you had. Spellbinding?? Thriller?? and poor Rina is barely peripheral.

If you've never read one of Faye Kellerman's books, check the publication date and opt for one of the early ones. At least then you'll understand what the acclaim is all about.",190,57
Books,61227374,1,negative,"I really don't like reading Faye Kellerman, but will do it if I am hard up for something to read, which is what happened this time.

I think the reason I don't like her books is because reading Faye Kellerman is kind of like being at Jesus Camp for Judaism, by force.  It isn't that I have anything against Judaism, it's just that I don't like being proselytized to or having religion constantly shoved in my face. And that is what Kellerman does, with her constant references to Orthodox Judaism, the family values, the good woman slaving in the kitchen and sacrificing for her children, etc.  It reminds me of accidentally picking up one of those Christian fiction books and finding myself in the midst of some characters who talk about nothing except how they're postponing sex until marriage, how they can be born again by giving their souls to Jesus, what they're wearing to the Purity Ball, etc.

I wish Kellerman would just tell her stories and stop trying to be the Tim LaHaye of Judaism.",177,58

Sorry about this review as I have read the entire Decker series very happily over the years....will definitely give second thoughts after this one about what I'll do with the next title....The supreme irony here for me is that I long ago stopped reading her husband's books for a very similar reason..Oh well....there are enough really good writers out there that we have many other choices...",141,64

I kept laying it aside and picking up again, forcing myself through the tedium.  When I finally made it to the last page, the outcome was disappointing, vague.  See for yourself.  There could be no murder conviction based on the evidence presented.

Keeping the characters straight was a problem.  There are all sorts of low lifes without much to distinguish one from another.  Then there is a great deal of extraneous material--what characters wore, every time they were presented.  A disciplining editor should have cut a hundred pages or so of fat off this.  The plot isn't all that good either, even if this were edited better.  Kellerman tries to write a gritty police procedural, but it isn't up to the standards of Ed McBain or Michael Connelly--or to Kellerman's previous work.  The grit somehow doesn't feel right.

I recommend that people skip this one, especially Faye Kellerman fans.",170,65

The whole story dragged and was so confusing with the million and one characters. I found that the story was slow to develop and many times I had to re-read a section just to wrap my mind around the cast of characters.  There were just too many names being thrown around.  Essentially I would say there were too many threads being pulled on at once.

I also find it a real treat to try to get a small glimpse into the beliefs and observances of an orthodox jewish family.  And, I enjoy the real family values that these characters portray, especially in this day and age.

This is the first book I've read by the author.  I very much appreciated the mystery aspect of the story which was well thought out, and was surprised at the outcome.

Peter Decker tries to solve the two murders.  About half-way through the book, the endless talking of the characters starts. The detectives were working very hard trying to come up with viable suspects who had a motive to kill both men.  There were so many names to discuss--where they went to school, how they knew the murdered men, where they were when the crimes were comitted, what they were doing now, etc.  For the last half of the book, that's all they did--discuss.  I was so glad to see the end of the book, that I'm not sure I could even tell you how these different characters were involved.

The book started to gain speed after the author landed the job with Per Se, but spends so, so much time on that same woe-is-me and now everybody-is-smarter-than-me, helpless, numb, hapless prose that makes diners of restaurants feel like they're asking for so much without meaning to. In fact, I glazed over so much of her personal life (this guy vs that guy) and her random Michael Pollan-like organic cheese rant to come back fresh, anew, and with surprised blinks at more description about the service at Per Se. That turned out to be the real nitty-gritty, the silk among the floss of this book. Wheedling aside, lady; people really want to hear more about the food.",177,9

Books,61228141,2,negative,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  The behind-the-scenes look at the precise and methodical orchestration of a high-end restaurant with its many players was really interesting and complex, and showed the reader that there is a ""system"" to its success as a hospitality industry, albeit for a very select few.  What disturbed me was the author's frequent need to bash people who have political and philosophical ideals different than her own, and which had absolutely no relevance to the topic at hand (other than to expose the author as a hypocritical morality bigot).  It would have been so much more entertaining to read about the restaurant industry, rather than to have to put up with her moral relativism (Republicans and diamonds are not okay, but paying $20,000 (!) for a single amazing meal and people who vomit from the excess, are).  Is the Per Se restaurant experience art or pretense or both?  Ruth Reichl's books about food and foodies and herself, although way beyond my ken, nevertheless drew me in and kept me entertained and wanting more.

In regards to the first: other than a poor, ameturishly condescending writing style the information contained is really informative and interesting.  She provides a high degree of detail for the operation of Per Se, which had me rivited.

For the second, she provides a dreadfully boring insight into her totally uninteresting romantic life coupled with pointless jabs or ouright rants on her political views (can she possibly think anyone cares?)and her convenient catgorization of people based on career, appearence etc.

Unfortunately, only about 30% of the book is that. and while that 30% is good, the rest is so bad, it really isn't worth the money.

For some reason, the author goes out of her way on a few occasions to rip republicans. Which seems odd, given that it's always completely unrelated to the topic at hand. Amusingly, she also warns readers never to ask a waiter ""what else do you do?"" assuring us that waiters live full lives in their chosen profession. She then spends the next 200 pages proving herself wrong, as we're treated to all of the details of her shallow life.

Strange book. She's a pretty good writer. I just can't imagine why anyone cares to hear about her affair when she clearly had a much more interesting topic at hand. Oh well.

  It is a kind-of sweet story about a young woman and her New York job---which could be in almost any upper-end restaurant from the way the book is written. There seemed to be much more about her romantic relationships than about her work, which is fine---except the book is supposed to be about her work.

Lowell's characters were rich and well developed, strong in their individual rite.

The story was shrouded in mystery and very intriguing as Hunter and Lina searched for the missing artifacts.  Returning to Lina's childhood home, they were met with an ailing grandmother,  a selfish mother and a temperamental father, and a cousin lost in the traditional Mayan ways of the past.

The most perfect, most beautiful of all sacrifices was to be the Mayan princess, unless Hunter could somehow stop the event from happening.  His entire future depended upon it.

Either E.L. was under contractual pressure to get it published in a hurry to take advantage of  all the Dec. 21, 2012 hoopla, or it was mostly written by a ghostwriter.  If not, and this E.L. book is simply a result of the inevitable ""I am running out of inspiration and enthusiasm for writing syndrome"" then a loyal buyer through the years like myself is certainly entitled to rate it low.

Toss  in lots of blood and guts  and the totally unbelievable plot, comic book like characters, and mostly tedious commentary I can only assume Ms. Lowell is under contract to produce within a certain time frame and, as she also writes with her husband as well, just ground this out.  I can only hope she finds her muse again along with respect for her loyal readers. I love mystery and romance, or mystery or romance, If plotting and storytelling is good.  I did like her characters, or wanted to, but they became simply caricatures.  I don't like writing bad reviews, especially of a writer I admire,, but I don't see any way around this one.

I realize that her books have contained much about the Mayan culture, but this was overkill. I appreciate learning new things through her books, however, when the topic becomes all about history, it overshadows all other aspects. It was predictable, there was an over abundance of discussion on Mayan history that dragged on & on, which made it very hard to read.

Houston, Texas is not a border town. South Padre Island is not a hop, skip and a  jump from Houston.  South Padre Island is several hours away from Houston.  South Padre Island is not an exit ramp off of I-10.  These jarring errors could have been easily corrected by looking at a map of Texas. There are no long driveways anywhere on the island which is just a spit of land.  The houses are not built on stilts. The Gulf of Mexico is not usually called the ocean.  It is the Gulf.  I'm only halfway through the book so who know what other inconsistencies will appear.

Okay...now it's just too much.  Have read further and Hunter and Lina have landed in Cozumul (an island!) and are driving to Tulum (on the Mexico mainland.)  Please.

There's one short part when something actually happens. The rest of the book is about the Mayans. The worst part is in the author notes at the end. She made up most of it!

No continuity, facts and characters just tossed in with no real connection to the story, no flow to the story.  Just got tired of trying to keep up.  Since it has been several books since I found one of Lowell's books to be an interesting read I'm just taking her off my list of authors to read in future.

The villain was predictable from early on and was too over the top to be believable at the climax.  It had one redeeming feature, the main characters.  They were wonderfully written and had nice depths. They were the only joy in the book. The plot line was predictable and pedantic.

She is the daughter of two very strong and complicated people and the current heir to the Reyes Balam lands in South America. She has studied the Maya on digs with her archeologist father and now teaches about the complex culture. When Hunter Johnson, former ICE agent and a sometimes student comes to her with photographs of stolen artifacts, she is drawn quickly into the hunt and into the treachery and fanaticism of those who worship the ancient Maya god Kawa'il, whose nature and rituals are shrouded in mystery. Bodies pile up as the blood of sacrifice rains down because a power-hungry entity known as `El Maya' wants to usher in a new world order - with the Maya as victorious this time. Plot twists and heart-stopping action entwined with a developing relationship are masterfully rendered by Ms. Lowell's hand. While sometimes surreal, each discovery and person fits seamlessly into the story giving it a real-life feel as we come inevitably closer to December 21, 2012 and its myriad possibilities.",196,35

From house to house to house, friend to friend to friend, we follow her with Marianna who is too caught up in the glitz and material gains her association with Martha brings her to stand up to her rudeness, smack her hand when called for, or leave her in midstream even when the safety of her own children was involved.

It is obvious that Mariana stayed friends with Martha over the years in order to take advantage of the social and travel opportunities afforded her by Martha, but Mariana then has the gall to complain about all of them.

Anyone with the least shred of decency would not stab in the back a friend of 20+ years -- much less in public and for profit!!  No person with any self-respect would reveal private information about another such as this author does.  Furthermore, after all those years, the author really has to sift and stretch to find any ""dirt"" to dish.  And if Martha isn't an absolutely perfect person, well, guess what?? neither am I!!

This mean-spirited attempt to smear Martha just ends up revealing the author for the mean-spirited, snake-in-the-grass that she is.

Plus Martha didn't seem too inclined to share or even too generous. The only part that seemed a little hazy was the legal wrangling at the end. Somehow none of that rang exactly true to me.

Mariana lost her livelihood, her home, and many of her friends when she told the truth at Martha's trial. Again, I don't understand how people can accuse her of riding on Martha's coattails for 20 years (are these Martha's friends or employees writing this?).
I have also felt that Martha was a driven person who sometimes probably didn't understand how her actions affected others, and this book confirmed that. I pass no judgement on Martha; she has flaws just as the rest of us do, and as Mariana does I'm sure. But it's certainly interesting to take a look at her life, her homes, and her relationships.

Sub-par at best, this release was a great disappointment, and while the remixes were not all bad, they did completely wreck an otherwise beautiful song, and that is unforgiveable.

If you are not a HUGE nin fan nor are you collecting all the singles and albums i would not recomend you purchase this cd.  it does not include the original version of the song (which is the only good version i have heard)  .  only the japanese import includes it as a 6th track.

i purchased this cd when it came out 10 years ago, and i was disapointed.  the mixes are long drawn out and just do not catch your ear.

but , like i said, if you are a collector of NIN cds, it is essential just like everything else.  so for that matter, its worth the 6 bucks.

ok, i'll get straight to it, this was the first NIN cd i bought. i happened to decide to go to the record shop the very day this puppy was released and picked it up for a song. loved it from the get go. this was the cd that made me fall in love with NIN. if nothing else it introduced me to four other amazing artists-Luke Vibert, Jack Dangers, Spacetime Continuum and Orb. the only mix that is less than superb is the orb. 5 tracks, 4 great songs, pretty easy to score don't you think?",139,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001Y7W,5,positive,"This is one of the first CDs that introduced me to remixing and is still one of my favorites. This is remixing how it should be. It bends the limits of the original work and creates something utterly different and brilliant. I personally prefer these versions vastly to the original, which is in my opinion, not one of Trent's better songs. I was very excited to see The Orb and Meat Beat Manifesto in the mix, they really brought out the finer and more subtle elements of the song and really made it their own.

The only NIN remix's that I would reccomend more than this would be the Telefon Tel Aviv remix of ""Where is Everybody"" which is absolutely incredible. I reccomend it to any NIN fan or TTV fan who is open minded and willing to hear what sounds more like a collaboration than a remix.

A final note to all you so-called NIN purists out there who didn't like this project because it ""didn't sound enough like the original"": Try making your own remix and see if it comes out even close to any of these...maybe then you'll change your mind.",194,13

There are five tracks of remixes, one of which done by Reznor which is the only track that comes close to resembling the original song.  The other four tracks are loaded with remixed industrial loops and blips that borderline on annoying and is kind of boring.

the original song is perfect in every way, and to have a whole remix cd deticated to it is great considering all of these remixes are really good too, though to have most (4/5) of the remixes buy other people isn't really like nin cds, its still really good, i just wish more remixes were by nin themself",113,19

 The Meat Beat Manifesto version is a great way to start out the cd, with it's layeryed drumming and symbols, this track goes for over 7 mins. long. This one very song made me go out and buy some MBM albums!
 The Plug version is good as well, but my favorite from the cd is without a doubt the NIN version, which is nearly 9 minutes long! This track builds and builds, and has without a doubt, one of the greatest endings in a NIN song, closely rivaled by Closer.
 The Orb version...well, that's the only one I can't listen to over and over. It's just far too spacy.
 Overall, this is a awesome cd which I listen to over and over, and even got me into these other bands. The only gripe is that the original version isn't on the cd, but with all these other excellent versions, there is no need to complain, at all.",195,23

The results are always fascinating, and often become equally valid versions of the song in their own right - that's why Trent Reznor always refers to them as ""versions"" NOT remixes. Here, though, Reznor has got a variety of people together to work on The Perfect Drug, and the results are not worthy of a NIN release. Trent Reznor's own remix (track 3) is excellent, and the only redeeming feature of the disc - it's very exciting and powerful, exploring the driving rhythms of the original, now infected with drums and bass. But the other remixes do not compare - they're interesting enough, but for most of the time they have almost no connection to the original song, which defeats the point of the exercise. Buy it for Reznor's version, but don't expect the same excellence from the other tracks.....",165,24

Get the original on the Lost Highway soundtrack, Closure, and We're In This Together Pt. 2 or you may even be insisting on finding it on the Damaged Box Set since it's the WITT singles plus things you wouldn't regularly get. But still get this!",110,25

I like the piano they included in the middle of this remix.  The two  parts i like best in the perfect drug are the piano and the drums.

The singles and remixes are no  exception, and in fact they are even more geared towards hardcore fans.

Listening to ""I'll do it anyway"" catapults back me to Florida  turnpikes and contains the best thing Belinda Carlisle ever went  near.
One of Evan's strengths is the quality of his song writing  collaborators, so it's unfair to see him as solely a one man  band.
Perfectly quotables here include ""Being Around"" a  heartbreakingly cool rhyme of wonderous simplicity. Copyright restrictions  prevent me or else I'd reproduce it all here but the closing line ""I'm  a little grubby from just being around"" is so cool.
""Favorite  T"" is nearly as good and again proves the quality of this  record.
With these songs combined with the singles released - this one  has to win a place in anyone's collection.
Only the worst bigot could  fail to be charmed by Evan's campfire song ""Big Gay Heart"" - this  from one of rock's greatest pin ups for indie chicks of a certain  age.

Dando is one  of the least appreciated musican/songwriters of his generations, which I  suspect is a result of his reluctance to sick with a particular 'sound' or  music genre. Personally I enjoy and appreciate Dando's ability to craft and  cover great tunes that range from clever pop guitar (I'll Do It Anyway) to  Country/Parody (Big Gay Heart) to Rock (Down About It) and the whimsical,  folky sound of ""Being Around"".

The music itself is lackluster and uninspiring. There are no stand-out tracks, and every song sounds like it could have been  written by any amateur songwriter.

But it's time to let him do what makes him comfortable. How many of you weren't fans of his Nothing but the Blues? Personally I thought that was the man doing what he loved best play'n the Blues.

However, Back Home, Eric's newest release evokes a different side of the man.  The mood is a jovial one with some spunk and spirit thrown in for good measure. Some folks say that Eric's guitar is quite muffled.  I partially disagree as such songs as One Day and Lost And Found feature some good guitar embelleshments.  I appreciate several other tunes that show Eric in a happy go luck spirit.

His talent is his guitar, not his voice - if I wanted pop, I would listen to Paul McCartney.  Eric's voice is okay, but not great, and while there are a few decent guitar riffs here, it doesn't compare to his better CDs in any way.

I know that Clapton has nothing against pop.  He's played with every one of the Beatles at concerts, and is featured on George Harrison's solo albums with George and Ringo.  However, he can't sing a pop song like George can, and on this CD he doesn't play the guitar as well as George and Eric did on their classic collaborations like While my Guitar Gently Weeps and Badge.

I hope his next studio CD is a Cream re-union album like the recent Cream re-union concert.  Perhaps going back to playing the guitar while Jack Bruce sings and plays bass will get him out of this rut.",177,26

It's an easy-listening/bluesy album about love, introspection (""Back Home"" comes to mind), family, and belonging.  I don't understand why people only listen to just Eric Clapton's guitar and not his vocal.  The singer's vocal, as well as his/her instrument, is what sets the mood for the song.  Just like that saying in ""Death of a Salesman,"" it's not ""what you say.""  It's how you say it.  And here, Eric Clapton says it well.  He's happy, he's living life to its fullest, and he wants his audience to know it.  A person doesn't always have to be depressed in order to make good music.

If you've enjoyed bluesy, guitar heavy tunes of Eric's in the past, you won't find even one of them here. The guitar work is mixed in there somewhere but only rarely does it stand out.

Eric needs to play the blues to sound good not 461 Ocean Blvd. or the other nonsense he has recorded over the years. This cd is no exception it fits in with the majority of his past work.

I have been a loyal follower and fan of EC since first hearing Cream on L.A.'s first free-form FM radio station in the mid-late 60s. I believe he has always been, and is now, a stellar artist. So, it's not without some perspective that I opine on this recent effort. The references to family are great in a scrapbook or photo album. On a record album? I think no. After realizing that what I heard in one of the cuts was a baby crying back in the mix, I really had a hard time going through the remaining material. It's a little too sappy. It's wonderful he is happy and I suppose for some (many?) it's pleasing to hear that happiness echoed in his music. I'll lay out on this one and hope the next time he gets a bit grittier.

It is an obscure album track from 1979's George Harrison album and Mr. Clapton puts his heart into and it is a touching tribute to Mr. Harrison.  Too bad the rest of the album lacks this loving touch and feels like a bore.",124,78

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,5,positive,"Eric Clapton isn't just a muscian, he's my friend. For over 30 years his music has formed much of the soundtrack of my life, from the angst ridden power of Layla expressing my own pain with unrequited love to the generational passion of Father's Eyes precisely describing my feelings as both a son and a father of two sons.

In ""Back Home"" we find an Eric Clapton who's found joy in family and as one friend to another I say ""good job"" and thanks for letting us share that joy.

The first release, ""Revolution"" has a feel similiar to ""I Shot the Sheriff"" and the George Harrison ""Love Comes to Everyone"" brings to mind the stage full of incredible muscians that was the ""Concert for George."" But the best songs of the CD are the title track and ""Run Home to Me."" Sounding like ""River of Tears"" it is packed with emotion and again as a father I can't help but wanting to remind both of my sons that they can always ""run back home.""

Thanks Eric for sharing your life with us, the pain, the hard journey and now the joy.",192,80

All this and with a rather young family.  On ""Back Home"", Clapton shows us just how versatile he has become.  Switching from playing old blues songs as on his two previous releases to more modern, current trends in music like on ""Back Home"".  I enjoyed the variation of material on this disc.  His guitar does take a back seat to his vocals, but his vocals are in top form throughout the disc.  The band and the recording mix is supurb.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000A3DFZE,4,positive,"Anyone who has followed Eric Clapton's career or seriously collected his music knows that this is an artist who faithfully follows his heart.  His body of work spans musical styles and every human emotion.  His 1998 album, Pilgrim, was an entire album about heartbreak and lost love.  Back Home is a joyful, upbeat album about found love.  Eric is finally at peace and content in his life, and his latest album reflects that. As much as I admire Eric Clapton the blues interpreter and rock guitarist, I deeply appreciate Eric Clapton the loving father and husband, and musical craftsman.  Back Home is a rich and fulfilling  product of the latter.

The songs on Back Home are exquisitely produced and energetic.  Many of the tracks include memorable hooks and melodies, something sorely missing from modern popular music.  And there are intimate lyrics that lie bare the heart of the artist.  Ultimately, this is a very courageous album to produce.  Will love and joy sell to Eric Clapton's audience?  Maybe, maybe not.  But as the songs on this album attest, the most important things in life can be found Back Home.  And that is where Eric Clapton's heart is, today.",198,82

In his interviews, he talks about how he's really happy right now with his life. Any fan of his would know that that's all that matters. He's playing how he feels. And it makes me wonder why all these people are complaining about it being to pop and stuff. He's writing about he feels.

He is still a good blues guitarist but if you want to hear great songs, great singing and super guitar riffs and solos, pick up Jimmy Thackery's, Sinner Street, Drive to Survive or Healin Ground.

Artists will never make all of their fans happy all of the time. The only person they really have to make happy is themselves.

Like one reviewer just said, eric was coming off the cream reunion and a really good Robert Johnson record and tour, and maybe we were expecting a corner turn in his somewhat laid back studio attempts over the last few years (reptile, pilgrim). This record makes those seem energetic. Lets face it. Eric is a great talent, but people should know where their strenghts lie. Songwriting was never a real strong suit for him. We all know that his strenght lies in his guitar and in his love for the blues. None of these are present on this disc. His tales of domesticity in these tunes are almost downright depressing. I know that people are ''so tired '' when they have kids. Every parent knows already. What we need is to be uplifted. And this record falls way short.",149,95

Not even guest shots from Winwood and Robert Randolph can help this thing out. Clapton scatting isn't my idea of a good idea.

We hope that each new record will catapault us back to the emotional sunshine of the 60's and 70's; a return to those days when the music was new and ground-breaking. It isn't to be because it can't be new anymore; but it can be refreshing. This the case with Back Home. Eric Clapton has gotten back to combining blues, reggae and R&B into catchy tunes that leave you satisfied. Perhaps not in a league with Journeyman, Back Home does enter that territory. Although Pilgrim was excellent musically  it was a very difficult record to listen to because of its themes and therefore had a limited repeat-listening lifespan. Reptile lacked punch. The return to his catchy pop sensibilities is quite welcome. We probably won't experience the ""Oh Wow"" of a 461 Ocean Boulevard again but this is a fine reminder of how it used to be.

Jada sounds absolutely HORRIBLE!  No rhythm.....no melody to her voice....no vocal skills.  She should really continue to pursue acting instead where she has much more potential.  As a metal fan, I'm frankly insulted that she thinks this screaming, howling, & cussing, (so much for all her husband's promoting clean music & not having any need for bad language) would actually pass for metal music.

While others are reminiscent of the now deflated ""Rap Metal"" or ""Nu Metal"" scene.  Jada has the potential to be a better singer than what she has delivered, she needs to really push her boundaries. From what I hear on this CD she doesn't really push her vocal ability much and I mean by singing not growling or screaming. This band can do so much more with the right producer bringing out that heavy sound a la Sevendust.

One thing the bothers me: when Jada sings about being in pain, are we really supposed to believe her? I mean, cmon, she's married to one of the highest paid actors in the world.  Her words just seem false to me.  I think the band would be alot better off if they'd just slow down the pace a little bit.  I give it one star for effort.  If there is another album, hopefully it will be more creative and original, but regardless, I won't be buying it.  BOTTOM LINE: if you like Rage Against The Machine, then this is the album for you.

Jada excorcises her demons on this album, but not very well. The music is mid paced Metalcore/grindcore, kind of reminding me of Crisis, but the music is actually the highpoint on this entire cd. The unbelieveably low point, however, is jada's vocals. It's like she tries to rap and scream at the same time, and it does not work. And She DOES NOT have a good clean singing voice. Period.

I think with a couple more years of developement and practice, this band could be something great.  If Jada just keeps working on melody and forcing a scream to be more gutteral, I think that this band could get some much needed recognition.  The music as a whole is what I rated this, 4 out 5 stars.  The band is really talented, the only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the rookie vocals of Jada.  Don't judge because of the whole Will Smith At Ozzfest Thing, this band is really surprising.

The stage show was great and the band definitely knows what they're doing. The vocals were a little more raw than the rest of the bands there, probably because they were one of the newest bands playing, I would bet that the cd is near pristine though. I ordered mine today.

Nu-metal may have died 6 years ago or whatever but so what, there is still a huge fan base and I think that it's all the much better that a band like this can exist right now amongst all the metalcore posers that all decided to jump on the hardcore ""bandwagon"".

This album sounds as if he's totally lost sight of his ""18th Century Rock & Roll base"" and has gone for more 21st century MIDI trash, on top of reissuing music that we've enjoyed for the past 20 years. His Fresh Aire series was wonderful.. as are Chip's other albums (Yellowstone, Saving the Wildlife) but.. has the Steamroller run out of Steam? As a diehard MS fan.. I was shocked and appalled that he ventured yet again into Halloween.. with less attractive results. He should  give us what we really want.. more Christmas music, and NEW material with the Steamroller sound we grew to love and adore!",181,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,4,positive,"This collection features three discs. When I ordered, I thought I was getting three CDs of Halloween music that I can play in the car or in my boombox. Instead I got one CD of Halloween songs, one of Halloween sounds, and a DVD of such songs as ""Creatures of the Night"". The songs were refreshing retakes of older songs such as Black Magic Woman, Psycho, Monster Mash, the theme from the Addams Family, as well as new titles such as Trick or Treat. All of these songs show characteristic Mannheim style and were enjoyable to listen to. Even though there were three CDs, I think it was a good value for under $20.",114,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,1,negative,"I got this because I was looking for something new for halloween and i saw they had covered the Dark Shadows theme and the Dr. Who theme and it came with a sound FX CD and a DVD, then i listened to it... the out date keyboard sounds (most likely a roland D5) and their love of turning everything into techno made this beyond wretched. the FX CD was just more effected 80's keyboard sounds and the DVD was nothing but goofy, self aware music videos of their songs, oh i'm sorry, and a dance instruction video. lets not forget the asinine tag on the back of the package... ""OVER HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN VIDEO!"" (this is exactly what is on the back of the box) I have no idea what they could have spent that much on, they got ripped off... and so will you. If you like these guys and their dated techno sound then this is the album for you. However, if your under 50 and want a competent Halloween soundtrack run screaming from this abomination.",179,7

Each has some good music and some hokey or kinky tracks.  It would have been much better to deliver the good classical stuff on one cd, so it wouldn't be interrupted by the less attractive music.  I like about one third of it, but it is mixed throughout, so, I probably won't listen to it often.",81,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000FS9MSS,2,negative,"This just doesn't sound as though Mr. Davis had his heart in it, or put much effort into it.

The songs covered tended to have parts chopped out of them--and for TV themes, there's not much one can afford to remove. The Dr. Who theme is by far the worst example; only a couple of bars of the actual tune survive. The rest is large quantities of unimaginative padding, heavy on the drum machines; for example, the repeated tonic/sus4 that leads into a mutilated ""Superstition"" will drive you batty... hey, maybe that's the tie-in with Halloween.

Please, Mr. Davis, get your muse back. You can do better than this.",109,12

Save for the somewhat overdone Ladies and Gentlemen, BSLS is cut for cut a solid record. Old-school fans of Saliva may be put off by the lack of heaviness, but those who looked away after 2003's Survival Of The Sickest are invited back instantly via accessible, matured song writing. At under 40 minutes in length, BSLS has no room for filler, and thankfully, there isn't any (although as mentioned earlier, Ladies and Gentlemen may take some time to grow on you). Fans of Alternative Metal, Nu-Metal and Medium Heavy Rock will more than likely enjoy Blood Stained Love Story.",119,0

Great band in concert, but this doesn't represent the band at all. Check out the new Fozzy All that Remains Reloaded CD if you want to hear an incredible rock/metal CD with ZERO ballads",65,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,"I have been a fan since ""Every Six Seconds"". I saw the video for ""your disease"" and I was hooked.
 This CD is different but it has alot going for it. Sure they are leaning towards a more mellow sound at times but that is just the nature of growing up. Critics write off 90% os the rock bands that have ever recorded.
This CD is cool. It is fast, slow, in between, sad, happy, and pissed off all at the same time. I have met the band twice and to meet them is to understand their music even more. They have a way of singing what they feel and not worry because they know people will relate to them.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1,negative,"This album is poppy, whiney, and overall a catastrophe.  I was utterly surprised to see that only about 2 or 3 tracks rock and the rest is mainstream sounding garble.  I agree that Saliva should have changed and evolved their sound from their previous albums as the rap/rock was getting outdated and overplayed, but this was an extreme case of the ""Woaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhs!""  Skip it.",64,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,"Every once in a while, a band releases a CD that is great from beginning to end.  Saliva did that with ""Blood Stained Love Story"".  Although my first experience with this band is on this CD alone, and I have not yet had the pleasure of experiencing their previous works, I am looking forward to enjoying their other efforts as well.  I am not one of these people who expect a band to have a similar sound throughout their careers, to me that shows no artistic venture.  So, when any band releases a new CD, I enjoy it for the fact that it is a new production.  Whatever it is that they (Saliva) have done in the past will be enjoyed as the separate works of art they have produced for my listening pleasure.  ""Blood Stained Love Story""  is a great introduction to Saliva's music for me, and I look forward to their future works as well.",157,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,"Two and a half years since thier last album (and worst) the boys from Memphis are back with a decent album.  Better than their ""Survival of the Sickest"" (3 stars) but not as good as ""Every 6 Seconds"" or ""Back into Your System"" (both 4.5 stars).  The main reason, to me anyway, is the growing amount of slower songs the groups puts out. Shorter than their other albums with only 10 songs, 1 is almost a classic, 1 I skip, 5 are good and the other 3 are ok. While it's a decent album and a good one for their fans, I prefer their earlier work more.

I love just about everything they've done and I think they're just about the best hard rock band out today.  Coherent lyrics, with great hard hitting music.  Each album is different but it's the same Saliva, always evolving, never reinventing.

I love ""Survival of the Sickest"", and ""Blood stained love story"" isn't quite as good overall.  All the songs are good (with one exception) and they have a few great songs on this album; Ladies and Gentlemen, Broken Sunday, and King of the radio.  Couple decent ballads, but who loves them for the ballads?  However I'm glad I'm not the only person who heard twister and thought ""Who the hell is this?""  That song is crap, but the rest it still great Saliva.

If you liked any of their previous albums, there's no sense in not buying this one.  I just hope they stick around and the next album leans more to their hard rock roots, they need to stick with what they're good at.",176,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,"I have to admit that I jumped on the Saliva bandwagon when I heard ""Click Click Boom"", but once I was on I never had a reason to get off. Even though their last effort seemed stale in areas, it was still a good listen. With Blood Stained Love Story, a natural progression is happening and it seems to suit the band well. The album takes a trip in a softer direction at times, but still goes through the old neighborhoods that made the band so appealing to me in the first place.",93,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,i like the album because iam a saliva fan! so buy a copy an listen for yourself only you will know if you like it or not.,27,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,"I enjoy listening to the evolution of a band and this is what we are getting with Saliva (speaking of the evolution of a band check out Porcupine Tree) It's an album I truly enjoyed from beginning to end. If you like music with and without the hard edge, if you like music with great variety, then go buy this. If you just want to stay in yesterday, well...just stay there...that's alright too!",73,15
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,"I am not a big fan of modern music the tunde down drop f bombs & have the cookie monster sing.  I overlooked saliva when every 6 seconds came out.  I likers superstar & click when I would hear it on radio  but did not jump to buy it.  I picked up every 6 seconds in the 2.00 bin at a used CD place & really liked the band.  They rocked hard but had a good MELODY to their songs.  There was that primal side but you could hear there was something more than just power cords.  I bought blood stained love story the day it came out & listened about 8 times I really like it there are all sorts of moments here fast & hard & cool melodic even with some leanings to pop.  This is one of the new bands that I see with staying power & I'm even glad to say they did an awesome CD with no f bombs.

These guys are at the top of my list for favoriate modern Rock bands.  That is a small club for me a rocker over 40.",189,16
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,1,negative,"This album is not the Saliva I know.  I loved ""Survival of the Sickest"", and this album is not like that at all, with the exception of tracks 1 and 8.  The rest MUST have been someone else.",38,17
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,"If there's one thing you have to say about this album, it's that it's very varied. There are many different types of music on the album, from straight rock similar to Every Six Seconds to more poppy music similar to Back Into Your System. Some of it is even reminiscent of their first self-titled album, Saliva.

However, I can't give the album five stars on principle. I agree with other reviewers in that Black Sheep sounds EXACTLY like Animals by Nickelback, if only a little slower. Not cool guys, not cool.

Other than that, a great album you should enjoy if you like Back Into Your System and Survival of the Sickest.",112,18
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,"Tell me no one else has noticed the similarities between Animals by Nickelback and Black Sheep on this album? It seems to me Saliva slowed it down to try to get people not to notice it. Besides this,the album is mediocre compared to their others. Ladies and Gentlemen definately rocked, the res is OK.",54,19
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,"When I heard Ladies and Gentlemen, I was excited.  I thought here is going to be a great Saliva album.  Instead what we have is another Daughtry CD.  I loved the first Saliva album, the second had some bubble gum, but still some rockin songs.  The third was raw and a bit immature, but still good.  This album is pop.  I thought Saliva of all bands wouldn't try to be Nickelback, but the Nickelback album at least rocked a little.  I am very disappointed.  If you want Click Click Boom and great rock anthems, listen to old Saliva, if Daughtry is your thing then this is for you.  Me, I'll listen to Ladies and Gentlemen until I wear it out, then I'll move on.",124,20
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,"Being an owner of all of Saliva's albums I am very impressed with this latest effort from the guys from Memphis. It is a more polished and mature album, however, that is not a bad thing. It is still hard-driving rock with some good power ballads thrown into the mix. As has been stated the song ""twister"" is strange to hear from saliva, but the rest of the album makes up for it. Besides, what band does NOT try out different genres of music with varied results? There is still plenty of kick-A** material to satisfy! I would highly recommend this album to anyone whose voice has stopped changing!",109,21
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,5,positive,"well though i agree with some of the other reviews saying saliva has ""slowed down"" however they do have a few that are still hard but the things is that the slower ones are amazing. they really are very good, i think the only stupid song on this album that didn't make me want to rewind the song was Twister. i hate the freakin sound.... however i think this album is defenitaly worth buying and giving it a shot. if u like ""always"" and ""Weight of the World"" and even a fan of ""rest in Peices"", u will love this album!!",101,22
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,"I own all of Saliva's CD's and was stoked to purchase the new one. Ladies and Gentleman is a cool different style of rock song. Broken Sunday is a great track and King of the Radio features some old school raprock so to speak that I love to hear from Josey. There are some soft ballads on here but I've listened to them a few times since I got it yesterday and they are definately startin to grow on me. The song Twister is completely random and definately does sound pop-rockish .....its just completely wierd to here that from Saliva. They'll probably play that one on 96.5 the buzz here in Kansas City. Anyways I like it overall but Survival of the Sickest was my favorite album so far, but of course I love all the older stuff, hell, Click Click Boom was my favorite song for probably around 2-3 years.",151,23
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,"I first listened to this CD while at the gym and I was pumped while listening to Ladies and Gentleman, then..............the wheels came off. What happened to these guys?? Other than track 1 and 5, this was dissapointing. And the Twister song?? I couldn't force myself to even finish listening to that song. As with all bands, maybe it's time to hang it up boys, you're definitely scratching the bottom of the barrel here. What a shame. Atleast your other CD's rocked. And I'm off to the bargain bin..............",89,24
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,2,negative,"As a proud owner of all Saliva's past work, I was very excited to purchase the newest release yesterday.  As the album began, I was pleased with the opening track and eagerly anticipated more, gritty Southern rock.  However, much to my dismay, instead I received dose after painful dose of soft, poppy, hook ladden top 40/American Idol-esque songs.  With the exception of one track near the end, the rest of the CD belongs in the ""easy listening"" section, not rock/metal.  Although I must admit, some of the chorus lines are a bit catchy, I was hoping for another CD to blast at the gym, not fall asleep to. This disc now belongs to my girlfriend, stocked away next to her Chris Daughtry, Kelly Clarkson and Kelly Pickler CD's... Very disappointed.",130,25
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,"This is Saliva's fourth major label album, and definitely much better then their last album, Survival of the Sickest (which seemed rushed and shallow).  This album is more in vein w/ their first two albums, both of which went gold.  It has traces of nu-metal and monster ballad in it - but thats works.

My only problem is track 7 ""Twister"".  The band should be named All-Saliva Rejects, b/c you can tell this song was written to appeal to the All American Rejects/emo punk crowd.  I think they kinda alienated their fan base on this track.  Very fake, very ""with the times"". Josey Scott sounds, least to say, ridiculous on this track - and I think he knows it...

Anywho - this is a solid album and its a great pickup, especially since many other similar artists have gone by the wayside.  Saliva continues to make driving hard rock thats radio friendly.  Check out tracks #1,2,5, and 10.  3.5-4 Stars!",160,26
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KJTFD4,4,positive,"WOW...first off so excited to see Josey and the boys out with such a great new CD. I agree with those that have posted before me. This CD is a great first for a new Saliva fan...Heavy enough for the old school fans...and with the radio friendly ballads easy to listen too...I have all their other offerings totally suggest Back into Your System as well...

Buy it...these songs were meant to get into your head...the bridge in Ladies and Gentlemen is Killer...Do you want it??? Do you need it??? YEP!!!",90,27
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,"Honggang Ma is exactly right.  I saw this product in a store.  Loved it's simplicity, 3.1 Mpixels for an incredible price. I thought: ""What's the catch?""  Then I asked about the type of memory. The store clerk had no idea.  He climbed a ladder to find the box, and still we couldn't make heads or tails of the info.  I used the web to find all sorts of reviews.  Nothing specifically mentioned the memory.  Then I found the previous review here at Amazon (GREAT reviews).  This settles the issue for me. What do you do when on vacation and you simply MUST buy another mem card?  With this camera, NOTHING! If you are not concerned about this issue, then definitely buy this camera.  You will not find a higher resolution for the price.  Be aware though, this is a ""point & click"" snapshot camera only.",145,0
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,"The main reason I bought this camera is because it has a SD/MMC Card. I looked at the more expensive DX-3900 and counted it out. It did have 2x optical zoon but used the wrong memory for me. I own a Palm M505 and want to have compatibility with that and my MP3 player. Even though the other chips may be superior in maximum memory capacity and probably speed, I think companies should standardise or we end up wasting our money as they change their minds. I purchased a 64MB MMC chip at Amazon quite cheap and it will work in my palm, the MP3 player and the Kodak camera... Go Figure. At least Kodak gave us the option in the DX3700. Others should but the DX3900.",127,1
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,"I did a lot of comparison shopping before eventually deciding on the DX3700.  The price of this camera is awesome considering it is in the 3.1 MP range.  I was a little worried about the new multi media cards being used compared to the most widely used compact flash cards.  My fears were quickly subdued when I did a little reseach and noticed that alot of your highend cameras coming out now are switching to the new MMC cards.  As for pricing on the new cards they are right in line with the compact flash cards.  These prices came directly from Kodak's web site.  A 16MB Compact Flash cost 25.99 compared to the new MMC at 26.99, also comparable were the 32MB cards with about a two dollar difference in price.  I'm sure as more camera's begin using the new cards higher memory capacity will come out also.  This camera was extremely easy to use, I was taking pictures about five minutes after I unpacked it.  And the picture quality is unbelievable.",172,2
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,"The pictures are excellent.  In fact, they are among the best for 3-mega digicams.  This is where the virtues of this camera end.  The 3700 uses an SD or MMC card that is hard to find.  Once you find them in some retail stores, they cost 3 times more than their CF counterparts.  SD or MMC are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization, yet this camera is bigger than Kodak 3900, an excellent camera that uses CF card.  Therefore, this card format doesn't make any sense.  Another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the SD card is 64 MB as compared with 512 MB for CF card. Since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution, I tried to order a 64 MB SD card...  The price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more.  Now I have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever I go. The purchase turned out to be a disaster.",172,3
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,"First Kodak makes you buy a Dock. extra 80 bucks.
Although this camera does take good pictures when daylight is sufficient, this camera lacks features and with problems.
No zoom. No timer. of course no video (which is ok)
Here are some real problems:
1. this camera makes DARK pictures when there is not ample light. Yes, flash is on. Regular 35mm (even those made by Kodak) cameras can do much better than that.
2. Battery life is short. Do not trust the computer when it says battery life is good. You will run out after taking a few shots. If you gone to a day trip you must remember to turn it off everytime after you take a pic in order to last a few hours

Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,"My wife and I bought this camera about a year ago. Right from the get go it had problems. We bought it on line so there was no recourse from the dealer,(if you buy a camera, go to an actual store, there are real people in case you have a problem!!!). Kodak customer support is a joke, if not down right rude, and offers no help. The problem withthe camera is that the batteries last for only 3 or 4 shots. If you buy the Kodak lithium cell($20.00!) it lasts for about 20 shots. If you do a little research you find that the camera requires 3.3 volts at up to 2.5 amps. No combination of AA cells deliver 3.3 volts (rechargables deliver 1.2 volts per cell and even lithium cells only deliver 1.6 volts) and anything south of a ""D"" cell won't deliver its rated voltage at 2.5 amps for very long. The long and short of it is that the DX3700 was a defective product from the start and short of fabricating an external battery pack with ""D"" cells, you better look for another camera.",187,7

They said they are aware of the problem on some computers running Windows XP. It is now several months later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.
It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?",104,9
Electronics,B00005OAY3,1,negative,Please don't waste your money on this camera. It uses a set of batteries about every 5-10 pictures.

Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,"This is a nice camera for the price. 3.1MP and takes good pictures with some practice. Be sure you have a lot of light when taking indoor pics though. Also, there is no need at all for the docking station. The camera plugs right into any USB port and shows up as a drive on the computer. You can then just pull your images off without having to use Kodak's software. As far as recharging the batteries, I picked up some Ni-MH batteries and a portable charger ..., and I'm good to go. I'd also recommend getting an additional memory card.",101,13
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,"... I have upgraded to XP. However, the software doesn't work with XP. I tried to download new software but I had problems doing so. I wrote an email to Kodak but they wouldn't send me new software and didn't really care seeing that insead of fixing the problem they tried to sell me a newer camera. In addition the battery life keeps getting shorter as the camera gets older. It is also very diffucult to get a shot of something in action since the camera takes about 2 seconds to autofocus. I would reccomend a different for people serious about their photography. ...",104,14
Electronics,B00005OAY3,2,negative,"This was not my first experience with a digital camera. After receiving the Kodak 3700 I thought it was defective due to the difficulty in turning it on. The main objection was the poor results with the flash in not too bright areas. Unless very close the picture was very dark. Just about all pictures had to be adjusted through a photo editing program. The delay in the focus and shutter operation left much to be desired. The final reason for returning the camera was the  incompatibility with the latest Mac technology just  released.
  When all returns are cleared I am going to opt for a Canon 110 or A20 or Nikon coolpix. Family members and friends have these and are very satisfied.",123,15
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,"I purchased the DX3700 somewhat out of desperation (many models sold out) but was intrigued by the high resolution. I also purchased a dock. The SD card was sold right alongside the camera and wasn't a price or availability issue.
I took the camera on a trip and had 56 high res photos on the 64MB card with room to spare. I thought the camera was a bit bulky and wasn't thrilled with the battery life, but decided to wait until I saw the picture quality.
When I downloaded the pictures to my laptop, I was pleasantly shocked by the beautiful color and detail of the photos. And the macro close-up shots were excellent!
Pros:
Low price for 3.1 megapixel camera, ease of use, quick battery recharging (less than 1 hour), great picture quality, excellent macro shots, decent (if slow) software
Cons:
Dock more or less required, so-so battery life, somewhat bulky.",152,16
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,"I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the DX3700...even those it uses the MMC cards...I don't care really.  I'm sure a higher MB cards will be coming out soon.  Reading the other reviews, I realized how much people are upset about that aspect.  But you must remember, every time something new comes out, it's this way.  They will constantly improve the product, and the price WILL go down.  Right now the highest MB card is the 64MB...which only allows about 75 pictures for a 3.1 MP camera...but hey.  Who needs to take more than that? *unless you are on vacation and don't have access to a computer* (which I don't worry about).
I didn't care about the optical zoom (which this model doesn't have) the model that did have it was [amt] more.  Now with technology constantly changing...it's better to be on the edge. And in a few years, when I'm ready to upgrade...I won't feel like I'm losing so much money in an expensive piece of equipment. THis camera only cost me [amt]",175,17
Electronics,B00005OAY3,4,positive,"this is my first Digital Camera, I purchased this Camera
so my wife, and I could take Picture of our Grandson, this was a

Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,"The DX 3700 is very easy to use and works well with Windows XP. Qualtity is best for the money. It compares to expensive... digitals with qualtity that matches if not exceeds. The only negative comment is that a ... Docking Station is a must, (that sales people do not tell you about), to keep batteries charged and transfer images to your computer.",63,19
Electronics,B00005OAY3,5,positive,"I have been putting off buying a digital camera for months. I was debating on the Sony Mavica, but the pixel quality just wasn't there. 3.1 pixels for such a low price! True, it doesn't have all the bangs and whistles that other digital cameras have, but it has the most imortant feature. Oustanding pictures. It doesn't have an optical zoom, but I seldom use that anyway. The camera dock (sold separatly) is a must. A simple push of the button on the docking station, and the pictures are in your computer ready for emailing or printing. What more could you want for so little money?",106,20

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,"Can't be beat for the price, respectable brand name and functions as expected.

One positive thing about these are that they are very light and do not burden ears!",89,35

They did a great job and have continued to fit the bill for the last few weeks.  I have had multiple people use them daily for projects and none of them have given me any problems.

When the kids get some ""vegging"" time or need time alone it is nice to not hear their games or tv shows (esp my daughter's favorite you tube videos which can get annoying).

They serve the purpose but the foam piece on the ears is already coming off right out of the package and when my son put them on I heard a craking sound and it was the slide adjuster piece that needed snapped back into place on each side.

After a week of no headphones, I decided to order these for them. I actually ordered 3 pairs, one for each of our classroom computers. These aren't super high quality headphones, but they are working great for our students. Yes, it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice, padded, over the ear earphones, but we don't. Since these were purchased with my own money, this was what was in my budget. I'm not sure I would order these for myself, but for the students, they do the job!",163,88

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,"Cost ok; fits flat on ears with wire to left side. one wire (a good thing) reasonably thick with good male plug. Wire attachment is weak due to lack of moulded strain relief. Strain relief is loose tube which is better than nothing; perhaps a little glue between the wire and tube would be an improvement?

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5,positive,I have already written a review for these little headphones.  They are small and you get what you pay for.  I love them because they fit my pea sized head! They are also cheap enough that if I sit on them or they do break I can replace them without tears. The sound is not incredible but definitely okay.

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4,positive,"These are in the Goldilocks Zone: Just Right-Just Right-Just Right! They are just the right price to feed to my 8 and 11 year old, both of whom have 'breakable tendencies.' Six of these lasted 9 months, an absolute bargain compared to the more expensive sets I was buying based on an assumption of robustness. These are just right so that they can be hauled around, dropped, kicked, jammed in the bottom of a backpack and they just spring back.

It takes quite a lot to do them in, and in the meantime, blessed silence, since each child is welcome to plug their headphones into their tablet so that the rest of the house doesn't have to listen to game-play or inane music for hours on end. A lifesaver on a plane, roadtrip, etc. For ears too small to accept earbuds, these are the perfect compromise.

The sound is tolerable....for games or light music listening. Not a lot of dynamic range for this price point, but that's not what I'm praising them for.",173,111

Maxtor replaced those without any issue, except that the replacement drives (which were refurbished) also failed within 3 months.  Quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data.

This is the second Maxtor drive that failed after just over a year (you think that I would have learned by now.)  After crashing a couple of times already, the drive seems to be heading to the death zone after the latest crash.  Of course, as another reviewer noted, the waranty is shorter than the short life of this drive.

This may appear to be a bargain but it does not last so it is very expensive in the long run.

I would not use a Maxtor drive even if it was given to me free bacause it is not worth the time I spend on recovery every time it crashes not to mention the unrecoverable data between backups.

Never again Maxtor.",137,9

After connecting the USB cable and flipiing the power switch to on, it was recognized instantly by my Win XP Media Center DELL 4700 PC. I used software it came with to set up the drive and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. Total formatted capacity 203GB!!

Match the drive you need to the drive interface that is in you unit to avoid problems.",77,12
Electronics,B00007KVHZ,5,positive,"I've owned this drive for many months and it has performed flawlessly. It (like other large & fast drives) gets pretty warm after running for a while. If you just make sure your case is well ventillated you shouldn't have any problems.

I've built many systems with many different hard drives and have only had a couple fail. They weren't Maxtor, but it just as easily could have been. If you value your data, either back it up, or go with a RAID system. Failures can and do happen, no matter what brand of drive you buy.

As far as the whiners that gave this drive poor marks, what can I say? Looks like instead of rating it on the merits of the drive itself, they took out they frustration because of either poor marketing, or an obvious case of not reading their own system manual before making the purchase.

Make no mistake. This is an great drive (for PCs built in this century) and when on sale, offers ample room for drive hogging chores, such as video editing and archiving. I highly recommend it.",185,13

Instead of searching the internet for third party software to do this, I took the drive back to the store and got the 200GB Maxtor instead.  Installation was simple, I just popped it into my PC and it was recognized immediately.  I installed the Max Blast software and the drive was partitioned, formatted and ready to use in less than 5 minutes.

I got the ATA card with mine, but I used another Silicon Image card I purchased previously (it has the same features but gave less problems, my computer took longer than it should to start up with the Maxtor ATA card). The MaxBlast software worked perfectly and never gave me any trouble. All those giving bad reviews because of the software or lack of card need to stop complaining.

I purchased these items because I was tired of paying for most of the things I didn't watch on cable.  I can get all of the major stations so when news and weather is a must have, it's all right there.  If you feel you don't need cable TV and you still have an analog TV set you don't want to through away,  this item and it's companion will save you money and extend the usable life of your old tube TV set.

It was an improvement over the previous Antenna I had, that was meant for analog signals.  However I bought a $20 GE Flat Panel Antenna at Target, and it worked much better than the RCA.  I find sometimes I need to adjust the RCA for it to get a signal.  It also seems to cut-out if people are walking around in the room.  No Problems with the GE.  I even attached a signal amplifier to it, and it didn't seem to help much.  I would just get a another Antenna for a little more money.",123,11

After reading the reviews (which are better) of the passive rca antenna that's basically this one but withouth the amplifier, I decided to connect it back to the digital converter without plugging the antenna into the power. To my surprise I am know getting 20 perfectly clear channels.  Cannot believe but it is true. Go for the unamplified rca antenna which is cheaper.",117,12

I'm embarrassed to say that I bought it in good faith from a Big Box store. It shouldn't be for sale anywhere. Boo hoo, my poor dollars went pay for this swiveling piece of crapolla. What's the point of plugging it in and turning some little ""gain"" knob when all it does is makes the picture WORSE than if you had no antenna at all. I can't say enough about how terrible this is, and how ashamed I think RCA should feel for pushing this on distributors. I will not buy anything made by RCA in good faith again because of this stupid product.",160,15

Electronics,B00008V6JO,1,negative,"This antenna is a huge waste of money.  I live in a strong signal area (<5 miles to the towers).  On an analog tv this antenna produced an extremely noisy picture due to the poor amplifier.  Without the amplifier, this antenna did not produce a picture.  On a digital tv this antenna did ok.  However, a cheap pair of rabbit ears with a UHF loop greatly outperformed this antenna both on digital and analog tvs.  I would not recommend the RCA ANT301 to anyone, even if were free.",88,17
Electronics,B00008V6JO,2,negative,"I am about forty miles from the broadcast towers. The ANT301's UHF reception was very good but VHF reception is poor. It picked up one of the five VHF channels in the area. I disconnected the power and there was no difference in signal strength so it is no more ""amplified"" than a normal pair of rabbit ears. If you are looking for an inexpensive amplified antenna, the RCA ANT1250 is a better choice.",74,18
Electronics,B00008V6JO,4,positive,"I was trying to get local HD channels added to my dish network setup.  I tried a directional NONamplified antenna and after 30 minutes of fiddling for the best angle, these are the signal strength numbers I got:

Fox - 68%

CBS - 63%

ABC - 59%

Fox was the only one that was watchable at this strength.  I bought the ANT301 and plugged it in and after about 5 minutes of fiddling, here are the new strengths:

Fox - 78%

CBS - 83%

ABC - 73%

All three channels are watchable now with no issues.  I would recommend this antenna if you are just within range of your HD channels and want to get a better signal.  It won't work miracles, but it does improve the signal over nonamplified antennas.",131,19

Time to pick up an antenna.

I just bought the 301 from best buy. The sales dude said it was the best on the market and he had no complaints or returns. Hooked it up in place of my coax cable contraption. It faired just as well, if not worse.

Second, the focus of V400 is not good. Sometimes you can see the cursor is shaking without any movement. These days, I found a new big problem. The mouse is frozen when windows xy starts up. I thought it was xp's problem, eventually I figured out it was my V400 mouse. I had a very good impression with logitech. But this time, I will double think when I buy anything from logitech.",138,3

The product did not come with mac drivers, but they were easy to find on the Logitech website. I installed them, restarted, set up the two extra buttons the way I wanted (used expose functions, so it's pretty much like a 30 dollar mighty mouse).

The ONLY thing that I've have problems with is that the side-scrolling cannot be adjusted, and it's really really slow. I've gotten good and just clicking it over to make it go faster.

But otherwise, the tracking is amazing, the scroll wheel is really nice, the buttons are great, it's perfect size, very portable. Good mouse.",141,4
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,"I didn't experience tracking and long wake up time problem as other user has reviewed.  I tried some different types of mouse pad and I think it's doing fine.

Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,"Logitech, so far, always appeared to me as being a first tier supplier of quality mice. I am shocked how Logitech could dare to release such a product. They are actually back to the good old days where users would need a mouse pad in order to get proper performance. The V400 does not work well on dark surfaces, it does not work well on light surfaces and it does not work well on tablecloth. I have actually bought the V400 because I did not like the scroll panel of the V500. To my surprise the V500 with conventional red LED works well on all mentioned surfaces where V400 is a nightmare. It is a darned cheek when Logitech claims to have introduced the V400 ""... all terrain laser tracking technology"".",131,6
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,"Like most other users here, the tracking problems I've encountered have been aweful.  Light or dark, mousepad or not, two different PCs, latest SetPoint driver software, it doesn't seem to matter.  Also, by comparison, I have the MX500 (corded optical), MX700 (cordless optical) and MX1000 (latest cordless laser) on various machines and all work perfectly on the same mousepads and surfaces upon which the V400 fails.  The MX1000 works perfectly on the same laptop with the same SetPoint driver software on which the V400 fails.  Bottom line, it's definitely the the V400!

The V400 mouse will work fine for a while.  Then, if you stop to type something (like the paragraph above), then go back to the mouse and move it, the cursor just stays put.  You have to move the mouse around quite a bit to get it to recognize that it's being moved.  Clicking the mouse seems to wake it up immediately but, of course, that may not be appropriate, depending on the application you're in.

As far as I'm concerned, I have loved everything Logitech that I've ever owned ... until now.  In my opinion, the V400 is a piece of junk.",195,7
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1,negative,"I just purchased this mouse and have used it for 3 days now.  It works well as a mouse, but it is very uncomfortable in my hand.  Having to use your index finger for the forward & back buttons is awkward.  It also doesn't fit your hand well.  I would not recommend this unit. I am returning the V400.  I originally had a Microsoft notebook mouse which works well and was comfortable to use; but I was specifically looking for a notebook mouse with forward & back buttons, the v400 seemed a good idea until actually using it...  I'd love a smaller version of the MX1000.

Note:  the logitech software that comes in the package is an older vesrsion that does not allow the forward & back buttons to work with the Mozilla Firefox browser, you have to download a 47Mb update from the Logitech support site.",147,8
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,"This is the only 5 button notebook-sized wireless mouse I can find and so I gave it a shot. Besides the fact that it does not work on a glass table, this mouse delivers! The tracking is in fact very good on most reasonable surfaces.

Money well spent.",48,9
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,"I've had the V400 for about a week now and I'm generally pretty happy with it.  The ergonomic design fits my hand well, and the rubber grips make it easy to hold.  The addition of the back/forward buttons is nice, though their placement means that you need to use your index finger to use them.  Another minor complaint is that they're not two separate buttons; rather the two ""buttons"" are part of a single rocker that tilts back and forth, making it slightly more cumbersome to use.  That said, I'm happy they're there at all, as most notebook/travel mice I've looked at do not have these additional buttons.  Aesthetics are subjective, naturally, but I prefer its clean, simple lines to Microsoft's blobby, ill-defined but otherwise comfortable notebook mice.

Regarding tracking, I've noticed that the V400 is stymied by darker surfaces and textures - dark wood and granite are two surfaces where it seems to get easily confused.  However, on lighter surfaces (the majority of the surfaces I use), tracking is flawless.  I docked a star from the review because of this caveat-- not really the ""all-terrain"" performance as promised on the package.",192,10
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2,negative,"Hi all,

I have both, the V400 and the Microsoft 6000, the V400 has many problems, seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go, the tracking is awfull, constantly stopping and restarting, the precision also is too bad, is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse, more if you try with CAD applications, any person, even the basic PC user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism.

Is true, is a nice looking mouse, i have many logitech products that are really good, from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one, this V400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had.

Kinda disappointing,

I'm uploading pictures of my mouse (Logitech V400 orange), so if you want to have a mouse to look and show, the V400 could be a museum object, but if you want a extreme machine, the Microsoft 6000 is the one to go.

Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2,negative,"I tried using this mouse for several days thinking that I would get used to it. I bought it because I liked the USB that snaps in- I tend to lose things easily. The extra buttons are a great feature. I also thought the laser would give me better accuracy. Well, I'm not a fan! The accuracy is not good compared to my cheapo logitech optical mouse. The tracking is awful. Plus, it is not very ergonomical, my wrist started hurting after only 30 minutes. I returned it!",88,12
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4,positive,"I don't use mice everyday, instead preferring to use a drawing tablet. Mainly, I use this mouse when with my laptop. I am probably not a picky about mice as the other reviewers.

That said, I haven't had any real problems with this mouse. It has worked great for day-to-day tasks, and the extra buttons make it little nicer to navigate on the Internet.

On the downside, it's not a sensitive as I would like for detailed tasks like drawing and photo editing.

I don't think I would want this as my only mouse/input deviece (considering the amount of graphic design work I do), but it is great for word processing, spreadsheets, and web browsing. For everything else, I'll stick with the tablet on my desktop.",126,13
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2,negative,"I have the same problem others reviewers write down here before me. A pitty I didn't listen them before.

The accuracy is terrible awfull, many times, I move the mouse, and the pointer star to move erraticaly or doesn't move at all. No precision, and do just the contrary that the add says ""all terrain"". I have many friends that have the Microsoft mouse for notebook, and they no have problems where I have.

The relatively good news, is that with time, if you play a little with the setUp, you reach an acceptable beahvior, but ... nothing compared to a normal old logitech mouse.

Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,"WARNING! DO NOT BUY THESE RADIOS!!!

I have alot of experience with two way radios. I live and work in the mountains of Montana and I know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios. I've had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when Uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers. Anyway, I feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking. Its slight but very noticable with regular use. I feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can't be certain. In addition, the sound of the audio is HORRIBLE! I was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply isn't worth it. The sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe Motorola should recall this product. It a serious dissapointment from a company who's name typically means quality. These may be the worst radio's I have ever owned. Sorry folks, this pair of radios are not worth the box they're shipped in.",194,0

Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,"I was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios. It was frequently very difficult/impossible to understand what the other person was saying (confirmed in both directions). This wasn't an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such. Simply, it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded. I have an FCC license and have owned numerous Motorola radios over the years. This set was a real disappointment. A radio that can ""ideally"" communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can't understand what the other person is saying -- even from a very short distance away.

Furthermore, the housing of these radios lacks durability. The rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone -- just cheap-feeling plastic now.",128,3
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,"The Motorola 9500 was strongly recommended. However the  set that I received turned out to be a piece of junk. Very poor voice clarity and quality. We depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor, to the point of just not using them, which put us in a very unsafe position at times.  I did call Motorola and was informed that I was past the warranty time and they would do nothing.  My recommendation is to buy a set of Midland 900 or 950s and have a quality set of communicators.",108,4
Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,"This is the first pair of two-way radios I have used.

They work very well, voice is clear.

I tested the range of these units by driving away from the other user, we kept talking until the signal began to break up, which was about .7 miles. Your mileage may vary.

This was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees.

These units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation.",74,5
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,Used the Motorola two-way radios on a 2000 mile road trip - great communications with day long battery life and swapping in AA Batteries did not decrease range of quality of transmissions.  Great radios - a good buy at a great price.,42,6

However, it should be noted that this walkie talkie tends to show up in the ""remanufactured"" sale list quite often. I suspect this as something to do with the audio problems that others have commented on, or it could be something else. If lots get returned and resold, it usually means something is systemically wrong with the design or manufacturing process. In any case, buy with caution.",118,8

The 2 mile range for urban areas that other reviewers have stated seems to be about right.  I might have actually gotten more than two miles, but I also live in Los Angeles where we don't have very many tall buildings.

Electronics,B000P6J67C,4,positive,"The Motorola T9500XLR seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment. Once out of the packaging, the 2 units are charged via a cradle. I have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well. First off, keep in mind these are not professional level radios, they are merely entry level units for home & family use. They are ideal for road caravans, amusement parks, shopping malls, cruise ships, etc. As other reviewers have mentioned, the voice over the speaker is ""tinny"" and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible. The range is definitely nowhere near the claimed ""25 miles"". In a typical setting, you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country.  Just remember these radios cost around $50 for the pair and you simply cannot expect professional quality at this price point. The NOAA radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle. Overall, I wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature.",182,15
Electronics,B000P6J67C,5,positive,"This is my second pair of two-way radios.  The first set picked up quite a bit of extraneous noise--wind, static, etc--but this pair worked much better and was clearer.
We used them for two days (my son and I) to try them out at the beach, at home and at a big park.  Once we found the right channels, they worked perfectly all places.  I did try to test the distances (difficult while walking), but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine.  There was a bit a static at the beach, but not too much.
They are not as clear as your cell phone, but if you are out and about at a amusement park or park with your child, they'll work fine.",129,16

There are other radios for under $100.00 that work much, much better.

I just returned the T9500XLRs.",75,17

Electronics,B000P6J67C,2,negative,"For all of the features and capability they put into these radios, Motorola forgot one key element...sound quality.  Other reviews that mention 'can't understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away' aren't referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers.

With only a passing knowledge of audio electronics, it would seem that Motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker, as the sound is very 'clipped' sounding and horribly distorted.  They could also use a modest compressor on the input, as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker.  For a radio that's marketed as a 'family' product, they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk.  After 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it, i still couldn't get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out.

These are getting returned, unfortunately, as they seem to have all the features i want.  We'll try again with Midland i think.",183,20

Electronics,B000P6J67C,1,negative,"After owning 2-way FRS/GMRS radios by Bellsouth, Cobra, and Motorola, Motorola radios were always the highest quality. They may not have been the best in every area, but they were always consistently high quality and they always worked. The last 3 models I've owned have all been Motorola.

I purchased the T9500XLR (their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio) the other day to replace my T4900s. I was appalled at them. The sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older, cheaper T4900s. And worse yet, the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually - at any range and at any transmit power. Whether in the next room or half a mile away, the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out. No settings affected this.

I ordered a pair of Midland GXT710VP3 radios instead. They're *way* better. They're what the T9500XLRs should be.",147,27

THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THESE POOR QUALITY PRODUCTS.

I complained to the UK and USA offices of Motorola and both fobbed me off.

The GPSr is held tight in the bracket. So tight in fact that you'll want to remove the lanyard before you put it in. The bracket is easily removed with a simple twist, but it stayed in place even over rough roads.

It works great for me when I go out cycle caching. The PN-60 will even calculate a road route to the cache!

*** UPDATE ***
The little plastic pins that secure the GPSr holder the bike mount tend to break off. That means it doesn't last too long if you go on rough roads. I've had to buy two more mounts. It is still useful, but it needs a redesign to make it last longer.",150,8

Electronics,B0014TU0OC,5,positive,"I planned to buy one of these handle-bar racks when I bought the PN-30 GPS handheld. I received the unit and made sure that it would do what I intended and within a day I ordered the handle-bar mounting kit and the carrying bag as well.

The handle-bar mount is a universal fit device. It clamps to your handle-bar by the use of heavy-duty zip-ties and DeLorme provides a self-stick rubber sheet that you wrap around your handle-bar before attaching the unit. While it is a primitive design, it works flawlessly and I tested it on some rough road before I considered writing a review of the product. It has not slipped at all and the PN-30 is held securely at just the right viewing angle for me.

I would love to see DeLorme modify the mounting kit to make it easier to put the GPS handheld into the bar mount, but, it is so secure the way it is designed, so, I am pretty sure they make it the way they do to prevent the unit from accidently coming loose if you are mountain-biking or riding a rough road like the Pan-Am Highway.",194,10

Believe me, if this clamp got stressed to the point of snapping you would know about it. The handlebar bracket was a sloppy fit, but wrappng a few turns of black electricians tape around the circumferance of the handlebar between it and the clamp took up the slop.  No slop after I tightened it. Solid as a rock. Now, my handlebars are only 22 mm diam. close to the brake cable mounts and then it flares up to 25mm in diam. towards the gooseneck. So now you know what to expect. I agree they should offer a larger diameter handlebar clamp and print a diameter spec to go along with it.",168,13

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,1,negative,"Whoever packed my order at this location thought it would be a swell idea to drop two heavy icepacks on top of the grapes.  Yeah, not so much.

Last time, it was four cans of Progresso soup on top of a tube of Quaker Oats which had been packed on its side at the bottom of the tote.  That was fun to clean up.

Wasting food is not my idea of a good time.  Get it together, Springfield.",78,31

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,4,positive,"This was my first Amazon Fresh order, so I didn't know what to expect in terms of the fresh produce. The grapes I got are about the same as what we have in local grocery stores at this time of year: smaller, a little tart, crisp. The ice packs in the delivery totebag kept all my produce cold. I'll probably still shop at my local markets for seasonal produce, but this was a convenient option and the quality of the goods was fine.",83,41
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B000P6J14U,5,positive,fresher than the bunches in stores.  Stayed fresh for 2 weeks.,11,42

Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,"My kids (and husband) LOVE Mio, but it's so expensive that I was hoping that this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink would be a better alternative.

It's not.

From the moment they all took a sip I could see that it was going to go into the garbage pretty quickly. All of them said it tasted ""kinda like Kool-Aid"", but then they all grimaced and got went for the water. They all said it had a weird aftertaste (the 8 year old said her mouth tasted ""funny""), and that they didn't want any more of it, or to finish the glass they had! So, yeah, Mio this is definitely not.",109,0
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,"This is the easiest way to add nutrients to my bottled water and to help me get the daily intake of water that I need. I'm not good about drinking ""plain"" water each day and this little squeeze has really helped me to drink what I should. Great taste, great product!",51,1
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,"Ive have tried the Citrust. Acai Grape Pomegranate, and the Fruit Punch. They all have great tastes. If you are looking for a drink that does not taste overly sweet, than this is it. A quick squirt in a glass of water was perfect. It reminded me of a blend of Propel and a Vitamin Water. Im not a big fan of sweet sports drinks and often water down my gatorade or powerade because it is too sweet. This is a perfect option for someone looking for a great tasting drink with good flavor that isn't too sweet.",98,2
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,"Great new product, I have tried 3 of the 4 flavors... TROPICAL CITRUS; ACAI, GRAPE POMEGRANATE and Energy PEACH GREEN TEA. I work in a high school and I am always getting sick.  I have been drinking Vitamin Squeeze for several months now and HAVE NOT BEEN SICK ONCE...this is the only thing I have done differently!  I don't like the taste of the tap water at the school, so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water. Finally, a truly great drink, which is much better than MIO and half the price of Vitaminwater! All it takes is a ""little"" squeeze for me.  Vitamin Squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products.  0 calorie, 0 carbs, 0 sugar!  Love it! My teens think the Tropical Citrus tastes like Tang or a Creamsicle. I am headed back to Safeway to get more!  I highly recommend this product!",164,3
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,"Ever since I saw Mio I thought it was a cute idea, but why do I really need flavor? I prefer function, and VitaminSqueeze Fruit Punch is my family's favorite, and get the flavor for free!
Great taste! My kids definitely prefer a small glass of ""Fruit Punch"" in the morning over a Gummy Vitamin. Anyway, great new product. I recommend.",61,4
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,":p

Product tasted great and I initially thought the bottle was great, squirt a few and you're good.  However, I left it standing as you see in the pic, and came back with product leaking/leaked out.  So that wasn't good.

I like the taste and am in the camp that, no matter how healthy we eat, we need to supplement with vitamins/minerals be it in pill, powder or liquid form, your choice.",72,5
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,"This stuff makes your water taste somewhat like KoolAid, but I wouldn't consider giving it to kids.  We need to eat and drink more natural foods, not stuff like this.",30,6
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,"This taste like kool-aid with a hint of cough syrup. I hate cough syrup and the kids here didn't like the taste either. It also contains caffeine, so you can't give this stuff to kids all day thinking that the vitamins will be good for them (too much caffeine makes kids go hyper active). If you dilute it a lot, it doesn't take like anything except for a kool-aide/cough syrup after taste.

The bottle is pretty large though and will last for weeks if you enjoy the taste.",88,7
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,The taste is so gross that I can't even finish it. I wouldn't waste my money on this. I would rather have an energy drink and take a multi-vitamin everyday if I needed caffeine.,34,8
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,"I cant say how much energy this drink supplement will give you, but I do enjoy the taste. It tastes like Hawaiian Punch did to me as a kid, but without the sugar. You just squeeze some into some water and you have a healthy drink without the carbonation or sugar of soft drinks. I like it. It's a nice break from lemonade, iced tea and other such drinks. And it makes water taste good!",75,9
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,"The flavor of this product is good - a bit too sweet, but that's par for the course with these sort of things. It is satisfying to know that my daily afternoon drink is providing all the vitamins i need for the day!

It isn't as concentrated as some of the other flavored drink mixes on the market, which means the bottle is really big. It may sound like an unimportant thing, but it's harder to toss it in your purse when the bottle is so large. But that's my only real complaint. Otherwise this product is pretty good.",99,10
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,4,positive,"I am used to the powdered packets that Crystal light offers, and I think I could go either way. The nice thing about this is that you can add as much as you like until the taste is as strong as you want it to be. I have no clue if the vitamins are doing any good, but as far as the taste goes, it isn't bad.",67,11
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,"I thought this might be a good way to get the best of both worlds: water plus vitamins. However, the taste was so awful, I couldn't do it. It tasted like bad Kool-Aid. I tried it four times just to see if I could get past the taste for the benefits, but it was a no-go. And on the fourth try, I squeezed the vitamin mix into my water and the vitamin bottle started leaking all over my hand and the counter. I didn't get it all wiped up and it dried super sticky. Makes me wonder just how much sugar was in it! I think I'll go back to the old fashioned way of taking vitamins.",117,12
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,5,positive,"This is a good sized bottle, and it lasts a long time. Dollar for dollar and taste for taste, I would rate this over MIO any day. It had a better flavor and no snails-in-the-mouth feeling.

It is very easy to mix, just take a sip out of your water bottle to make some shaking room, squeeze in less than you think you'll need, shake and taste. The flavor on this builds up very quickly so start off light. Unlike Mio it doesn't go from zero-to-nasty in a hurry so you have some room.

Teens liked this better than adults, of course. I didn't tell them it was a vitamin drink.",111,13
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,1,negative,"We all tried it (2 parents, 13 year old, and 10 year old).  Nobody liked it.  Older child said that it tasted like chewable vitamins.  Adults didn't think it was THAT bad, but didn't like it either.  Net result is that after everyone tried it once, it sat untouched on the shelf in the pantry for months.  Nobody wanted a second glass.

It can't deliver the vitamins if nobody drinks it.",71,14
Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food,B006MONQMC,2,negative,"This adds Vitamin C and caffeine to your water, which is great for people who are looking for that.  Caffeine may boost your workouts, and is the daily drug of choice for many of us, but watch out for side effects and don't over do it.

The deal breaker for me on this one was taste.  It tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch Kool-Aid, with a pronounced aftertaste.

Bottomline, the taste is fine and I can see the benefit of being able to fine tune the taste for varying sizes of cups / H20.  But, in the end I was put off by the fact that you have to keep this stuff in the fridge and depending on how you squeeze it, it's inevitable that you're going to make a mess here or there.  I think it's much more versatile to utilize the powdered form (at least for me).",100,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,Not that great of a set because it's overpriced for one and there's almost no down in the comforter. You're better off going to WalMart or some place like that and buying one. Very disappointed.,35,0

I wash it on delicate and dry on low heat, it has held up very well to weekly washings. So far all stains from baby formula to ink have washed out. I am pleased thus far and considering buying sets for the kids.",72,1

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,"It was soft and great right out of the bag, however the 1st time we washed it, feathers were everywhere.  By the time we washed it the 2nd time, it wasn't more than just a piece of material and had to throw it away.  The tag said ""machine wash"", this one must have had a flaw in the material or was just cheaper made.  I bought one just like it 6 years ago and it looks as good as the day I bought it after multiple machine washings. I was VERY disappointed in this product.",95,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"What a remarkable value! For the low price, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's a lovely set....at twice the price! All pieces are well-fitting, comforter is warm yet lightweight, and an added bonus: it's even reversible! Now I regret not getting a couple of other colors as well, because they are all out of stock in Cal King now.",61,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"So I read the reviews, but recongize that some people have unreasonable expectations.  You get what you pay for.  But, this set is amazing, and for the money fantastic.  I saw that people compained that the feathers came out...I have never seen a one.  It is very warm, yet, isn't too warm when your heat is up.  I have slept with the windows open and that soft cozy feeling is amazing. I bought the Khaki color is very soft, and feels like a super high quality set it comes with pillow shams and skirt.  You will just love it and don't be scared of the other posts....",107,5

I've on had the comforter for about 3 weeks and feathers are everywhere... even getting all over our clothes. My husband is sick of it and just said yesterday that he's planning to take it to the Salvation Army and just buy a comforter from Walmart. The style and look is nice, but the feathers coming through the fabric is insane!",84,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,"I was excited to receive this set because I love the color red and really wanted to try a down comforter. I slept great the first night and I loved the microsuede fabric. I did not like, however, how each time i touched it the feathers would come flying out.

I should have returned it, but didn't!",58,10

It is really easy to clean- we've taken it to the laundro-mat and washed it in the huge washer, using the huge dryer, adn tennis balls to make sure the stuffign was dry. I would buy another for our daughter's room, but she hasn't decided on her colors yet...",75,11
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,I would not recommend this comforter to anyone.  From the time I took it out of the bag it came in feather have been everywhere.  It only gets worse as time goes on.  It is comfortable and warm and it would look good if not for the white feather all over the place.,53,12
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,this comforter set arrived to me in a huge box i was like oh yeah until i opened it there was more paper in the box than comforter the comforter bag was so small like it was a sheet set i cant believe that there is no down in the dame thing i wonder why they only want $35.00 for it because your getting a sheet set with 1 feather in it and called it a duck down comforter i read other reviews and they said that feathers are everywhere but i don't see how that is possible if it did not come with any feathers unless they some how lost the feathers during shipment lol or my duck was bald go figure,123,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,"it had very little to no down. It looks like there is some filler it the photo, but when I received it the comforter had no fill. Somehow it got passed quality control with no down in it.",38,14

I thought for the price, I would try it and hope for the best. Unfortunately, my comforter did the same as others and with it being a dark brown, it is very noticeable that the feathers are coming out. This is not just an occasional feather either. It started out that way, but after a week or two, it is all the time. I especially notice it in the stitching areas. Disappointed.",98,16
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"I love my new comforter!  It is deliciously soft and comfortable.  Be warned: it is much too heavy for year-round use, but PERFECT for a freezing winter night.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,It's well worth the 35 bucks.  It's not too thick which means you can actually sleep with it and not sweat to death.,23,20
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,"For the $35.00 I paid for this set...it was well worth the money.  It is so warm, so cozy, so soft, yet it looks very high-class!  It is not as 'poofy' as the pictures make it look, even after giving it a big fluff-up.  But it really does add a touch-of-class to our room, and I wish I would have gotten the red set too for our other room.  The only problem that I've had is that the feathers/down come out a lot.  Not really at the seams so much, just at random places, all over the comforter.  It's a little annoying always vacuuming them up, but other than that it's been great!",113,21
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,"The comforter is soft and pretty however, it isn't very full and fluffy. The worst of it is that the down feathers fall out of the comforter's thin material and make a mess in the bed. We are not able to use this comforter at all.",46,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,"No problem with the shams or bed skirt and I loved the color, but the feathers in the comforter started coming out very quickly.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,"Great deal for the price. The stitching is very weak and has only one stitch accross each pattern. If it breaks, and there were breaks, then it breaks loose.

It is NOT 100% Down.  It says 75% on mine yet the ad says 100%.

Each color has a different feel to it and it's noticeable.

Having said all of that, I gave it a 4 because for the price you are getting something worth what you pay for.  It is warm and maintains the warmth.  Not like the true 100% down comforters though.",93,24

Can I get a refund on this ?",72,27

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,"Ordered this set in navy.  Loved the look until I opened it.  White feathers inside the comforter would poke through the exterior(top of blanket) with debris. It looked amess and very unattractive. Bought a lint brush to attempt to wipe off the feathers but that did not do anything. I removed the comforter set from the bed within two weeks of having it. I do not recommend this color at all.  Maybe the lighter colors would work better, but I am not willing to find out.",86,34
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"Several years ago I purchased a comforter and shams as a gift.  It was three times the price of the one I just bought from Amazon, yet identical in every way with the exception that the Amazon purchase also came with a bedskirt.  It's lightweight but warm, has a good loft while still being flexible, the filling is actually down and not the pin feathers that tend to crackle and end up poking through the fabric. Other reviews I've read on this product reflect disappointment that the shams are thin.  Well, they're shams, you know?  It's the pillow within that gives a sham life.  Honestly?...I didn't expect this kind of quality for the price I paid.  Very well made, excellent price...perfect purchase.  Thank you so much!",126,35
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,The comforter is very very soft and holds heat very well.  The only complaint I have is that the down feathers seem to be coming out but I'm sure this would be solved with a duvet cover as I don't have one.,42,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,This is a great product for the price.  I have it on my bed now and looks wonderful.,18,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,I was not very satisfied with this product. it is very thin and don't feel like a down comforter. I guess there is little down fill in there. I didn't want to deal with the return procedure and pay the shipping to send it back so I end up kept it to use on the sofa.,56,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"I am from Arizona and wanted a light weight down comforter, didn't realize it came with shams & skirt.  Best buy anyone could fine. Nice quality and fit",28,39
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,"This is a good comforter for the price amazon is selling it for.  I wish the microsuede was on both sides, cause you can only feel the softness if you are sleeping on it.  It's also kind of short for a queen bed.",43,40
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,We got a great deal...and worth the money..it does have a luxurious feeling...it does its job well- keeps you warm,20,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,the price was really good however it was very thin and not very warm. I would have to however that the worst part about the blanket is that it sheds feathers all over the place basically rendering it useless. Do not buy unless you like feathers all over your pajamas and floor,52,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,"this is just cheap all over. but i guess for the price what do you expect? i now use it as a ""pillowtop"" for my mattress and its fulfulling that duty pretty well",33,43
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,1,negative,"If I had known that Down fill means feathers, I would not have brought this item.  Feathers were everywhere.  I would not recommend this item to no one only if they like feathers.  Very Dissatisfied!",35,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,I like this quilt because I don't have to worry about the cover twisting around.  But I have had it for a year and it's not going to survive much longer. It's losing feathers at an alarming rate.,38,45
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,This is a nice warm mild weather comforter. It's soft and comfie but suffers from a common failing. It leaks a few feathers now and again.,26,46
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,2,negative,I got one of these and after a few days feathers are coming out everywhere - looks ok and feels nice but not worth the mess it makes pulling feathers out.,31,47
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,"When first opened, was thinner than expected. Was able to fluff up by washing it. Very warm and comfy.",19,48
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"We just recently bought this comforter set off amazon for a great deal! We were pleasantly surprised when it arrived and found it to be of great quality and extremely soft! It's replacing our old down comforter that we loved so much and I can honestly say that this one is just as good as our first one that we paid lots of money for! So if there are any available definitely buy, as this is a great comforter set for the money and would make great Christmas gifts! My husband loves it too!!",94,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,4,positive,"I really love this comforter set. I read a couple of reviews before I purchased it, so I knew what to expect. It's not too big and fluffy, which is fine for me because I'd rather wash it myself than send it to the dry cleaners. It's very soft and comfortable and I complimented it with some nice throw pillows, so it looks awesome.",64,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"I ordered this down comforter set in brown for my 13yo son.  I just love it and more importantly so does he.  He has never had a down comforter before and couldn't believe how warm and cozy it is.  The brown microsuede is an impressive and durable fabric.  Just before writing this review I asked him what his review would be.  His reply was, ""It was sent straight from heaven!.""  Yeah, a little dramatic but he really loves it!

The reverse side of the comforter is a cotton or a cotton blend that is slightly lighter in color than the microsuede.  I will be using the bedskirt to construct some box pleat valances for his room just because with everything on his bed it was just too much brown.

I am also going to be ordering this set for my youngest sister who was jealous that a 12 year old had this nice of a comforter set.  She thought it was a $200 set!",164,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"My boyfriend and I just bought a new  house, and now that we're unpacked, we finally have a chance to start decorating.  The house is very modern, so we're using a lot of black and chrome for our accent colors.  I was a bit impulsive when purchasing this set, however the fact that the duvet is down, and that it came with a matching dust ruffle really sold me!  The dust ruffle brings the entire set together.  It provides a much sleeker look.  I was hoping the down duvet would have been a little thicker, but overall I am very impressed with what I was able to get for the money.  In addition, I thought the pillow shams were perfect.  Usually shams are too thick and bulky, so I don't put them on the pillows I sleep with.  However, these shams were thinner, yet elegant, and very soft/comfortable enough to place on a pillow you will be sleeping with.  (Not just for decoration.)  Great buy, excellent value !!",168,52
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"At first I wasn't that thrilled, I thought it would be fluffier/fuller. And, the shams looked really cheap. However, I went and checked out some other down comfronters and realized that they were the same fill as mine and they were 6x the price. After a nights sleep I was in love. It was soft, soothing, and warm. The next day I matched it with a bright pink 300TC sateen sheet set from Amazon and it really made it pop. The next day when I came in from work I felt like I was in a new room, it even looked as if I spent much more than I did. It's a great buy. The shams are still cheap looking but you can dress them up with extra pillows from the money you save.",134,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FJQED8,5,positive,"$39.99 for a great little comforter set. Got the chocolate brown one to put on bed in our lake cabin, and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Very warm, soft, and nice looking. Comes with comforter, 2 shams, and bed skirt. We got free shipping, so even better deal.",50,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"I would just say on this pot and pan cover that it is heavy weight cover and must be a different one that I saw before I purchased one. I thought it was going to be real light but when I received it, it was definitely a heavy weight lid. For $10 it was a real bargain. They must have made it heavier since the one in the article. Don't buy a 12 inch one this is good for only a 10 inch. It's excellent!",85,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"This lid, with its double-ply construction is much better than those available locally in the kitchen departments of discount and hardware stores.  It has no sharp edges.  It arrived a little ""bent"" but was easily straightened.  It would have been nice if the description included the fact that it was aluminum--this should not be assumed!",55,1
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,This thing is tiny- too small to cover my 10 inch frying pan. Guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. Into the trash it goes.,28,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,I received this and it was all scratched up and look used. Don't waste your money!,16,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,"Sad that a made in USA item is so flimsy. Was delivered with minor dents and discolored when used to cover a frying pan containing sliced potatoes.  Prior review that mentions not good for covering 12"" pans is misleading.  It barely covers a 10 1/4 (#8) Griswold CI frying pan.",50,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,"Have a number of odd-ball or miscellaneous pots and pots? You want a lid for it, but it either never came with one or you have lost it. Your savior is at hand. I have been using mine for years, and is pretty beat-up and abused. The fit is kinda awkward for smaller pans, the fit is usually rather loose, plus it will not fit 12 inch skillets. Still, I love mine and would never give it up.
You might want to consider another brand that will cover a 12 inch pan.",92,5
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,"I wanted something really light weight to keep in our RV, and this one does the job perfectly. It's very light weight, and it would honestly be easy to bend. But it's perfect for what I wanted it for.",39,6
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,"Perfect for cooking bacon, hamburgers or anything that splatters. It is 10"" in diameter and can fit all pots for that size. I highly recommend this cover.",27,7
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,what can you say? these work and are cheap.,9,8
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,Very good for different size saucepans but be warned as  the lid may become very hot.,16,9
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,Very nice.. Do you have a smaller one for a small fry pan?,13,10

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,"This arrived bent and it was flimsy and pretty much a piece of junk - unfortunately I needed it immediately so I could not return it.  While I did not expect it to be a stellar piece of equipment I did expect it to be a little bit more substantial than the lids on my grandson's toy cook set.

Would never buy it again.",64,13
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,Way overpriced. Poor quality. Something you'd find in a dollar store.,11,14
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"Arrived quickly.  Product was just as described.  Not heavy-duty or for everyday use, but works great as a universal pan/pot lid for occasional use.  It's a bit over-priced.",28,15

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,2,negative,"Is actually rather small, did not fit the big pans I bought it for but does fit our smaller pots and pans okay. Nothing special.",25,22
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,Good everyday cover that fits a variety of pots. It did warp a very little either in transit or it was shipped that way.,24,23
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,"Complete crap!  The lid is very thin and does not insulate the food when it is cooking.  It was already slightly bent when it arrived but I was able to bend it back straight again.  Most importantly, it DOES NOT fit all pots well at all.  The handle on most pots is angled in a way that it does not let the lid lay flush on top, so the whole reason for having a lid is lost.  Do yourself a favor and skip this product.",85,24
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,Pen was not the right size.  I needed a university cover that was larger.  It did not cover my large Teflon skillet  Was two inches too small.,27,25
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,"Purchased this for my brother.  He loves it.  It fits his fry pan perfectly.  One review said it dented easily, and my brother doesn't understand how this could happen because he thinks the lid is quite sturdy.",37,26

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,The lid isn't as wide as I had thought so I cannot use it on very many skillets. This is my fault as I didn't measure everything. But it is a good product for the money.,36,28

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,"The worst lid I have ever had. Very cheap, can't use in the dish washer as it turns color.",19,34

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"inexpensive covers that do the job.  One arrived with a ding, but no big deal.  They do what is intended.",20,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,It works as it should. I did end up flipping the knob to the other side so that the lid wouldn't be resting on the handle of my smaller pans. It is a bit overpriced. Seems like something you'd find in a thriftshop for 50.,45,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,1,negative,Wish I could return this. Tornished after first wash in dish washer. Really thin and flemzy.,16,43
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,This pan cover is very thin and simple - but it does the trick! Does not fit over our large crab pot - bit fits over just about everything else. No problems so far - we've had it for months.,40,44
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"I like this product, but if you have a pan with has a handle that raises above the level of the pan, this top will not lay flat and steam will escape.",32,45

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"This works well for me - it is not a perfect fit as other reviewers have noted, but with the graduated sizes, you move it around a little to find the best fit for your pan.  I just appreciate it stops any splatter!  Most importantly - Amazon has fixed the problem of these lids arriving dented.  With airbags and in a big box, my lid arrived in perfect shape.",69,52

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,The metal is pretty thin on this but it serves it's purpose. I use it when my family goes camping so it doesn't get used a lot. I like that it will fit lots of different size pots and pans.,40,56

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,So many skillet sets come without a lid!  This lid is perfect for the 2 pan set I purchased for my college son in his first apartment.,27,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,5,positive,"I love this pot cover. The handle doesn't get hot so I don't have to find a pot holder to pick it up. It's very light which is great with my arthritis. It fits beautifully over my medium size omelette/fry pan. I can place my favorite ingredients for a vegetable, cheese fritatta with egg whites in the pan, cover it with this 10"" cover, turn the burner down to very low and wait until it hardens into a perfect egg-veggie ""pancake"". Then I quarter it (4 wedges) and have 4 breakfasts ready to go when I am in a hurry! I like that it does not fit so tightly that it cannot breathe a little. It does lie flat and that is good enough for me. I also bought the same pot cover in a16"" size to use in my very large fry pan for poaching salmon... also very slowly, in ~ 1/2 cup chardonnay, water to cover, 2-3 pepper corns, lemon juice, bay leaf, fresh parsley and a slice of onion. Only takes a few minutes on low once it boils. Both covers are the ones I use the most in my kitchen.",194,61

Home_and_Kitchen,B000HM9Z9I,4,positive,"I wanted a replacement lid for a 10-inch Dutch Oven and was trying to save money by not buying a glass lid. One Amazon reviewer said about this Fitz-All lid: 'I love mine and would never give it up.' That was a great endorsement, so I bought one. It is 10 1/8 inches in diameter. The aluminum has a concentric circles design, with a very slight concave to the underside. The lid sits flush on top of my Dutch Oven, with no lip or edge to keep it from sliding. No problem, though, and it does a good job keeping in the steam when slow simmering chili or spaghetti sauce. Make sure to measure the pots you have to see if it will fit the 10 1/8 size. My Dutch Oven is cast iron, inner diameter 9 7/8 inches and outer diameter 10 1/8 inches, which works fine with this lid. I haven't tried it on smaller-sized pots/pans, yet, but that is supposed to be one of its advantages -- handling a range of sizes.",175,78

However, the specific caliper that I received appears to have small specks of rust on the jaws and some scratches.  In addition, the caliper actually shipped outside its plastic and foam case. The shipment was well packaged, so there was no damage to the caliper, but it seemed like it would have been safer to put the caliper inside the case.

- the moving part has a wee bit of wiggle, which means any 1/64 in+ precision measures are going to be way off.

Worse of all the measurement is off - I know a man with 2 watches can't tell the time but I was measuring some pipe fittings and tried this caliper directly against another one I have I trust and readings would oscillate over- and under- what the other one says.",152,49

While a digital readout is certainly simpler, the thought of a dead battery really bugs me, especially since this is not something I'll use every day (and so keep spare batteries around). A dial caliper is simpler but more money than I wanted to spend. If you've never used a vernier caliper, I'm sure there's a tutorial video on YouTube. :)

Box arrived with a little oil stain on the corner; no big deal. I did need to wipe the oil off the calipers after opening the box.

They look a teensy bit cheap, and feel a teensy bit cheap, but only because I've seen VERY expensive sets of calipers. These are good, and from what I can tell, accurate to the nearest millimeter at least (I'd certainly hope so...) based on my measuring of things I've measured with other calipers. They were able to measure my 125mm dropouts easily, and have helped me in deciding on how to rebuild the drivetrain on my fixed gear.

I'd recommend them based on their perfectly adequate functionality, inexpensive price, and solid-looking construction. Again, mine are kinda cheap feeling but not to the point of it being a significant flaw. They just don't look like you paid $50 for them. More like $20.",183,91

It did fit, but it wouldn't lift a 1,000 lb load although rated for 4,000 lbs.  The screw was well lubricated with grease, but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank.  It was cheap, but still not worth the little money I paid.",63,6

Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,Cheap screws! Heads stripped VERY EASILY ! Had to drill all holes before putting in screws to prevent head stripping out. Couldn't remove without pliers. Softest stainless screws ever. Go get screws somewhere else ! High priced junk !,39,5
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,2,negative,These would have worked better on my dock if I was willing to pre-drill. The first (and only) I tried to screw into my dock's pressure-treated boards stripped (the heads) almost immediately. I had to use a wrench to reverse them out. I went to the local hardware store and bought screws that worked much better. I ended up putting around 200 screws into my dock. Having to pre-drill would have been crazy.,73,6
Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,5,positive,Used these screws in the installation of our dock bumpers and am very pleased with their performance.,17,7

Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,"As others have observed, the heads strip VERY easily.  The Phillips socket is too shallow and the metal is quite soft so even when exercising great care they are prone to strip.

Save yourself much frustration and find another option.",74,10

Industrial_and_Scientific,B002IV6R38,1,negative,"Too bad Handi man has a good name.  Even in soft pine these very soft screws strip immediately.  Count on losing half your box trying to use pliers to twist them out and start over.  Too long for your regular dock bumper- you need maybe half the size.  I was working all day trying to drill pilot holes (should not have to) Then stripping almost every other head.  Used multiple bits, drills and drivers.  Not my fault.  Go look for stainless steel screws half the size and with good solid reports.  See anything that says these strip then stay away.  Sorry but our time is worth more than a faulty made product.",112,18

I bought it for my backpack and ended up having to sew it on; it was a mess with all the glue, which is sticky and messy but not adherent. Also, it comes folded in thirds, which creases it horribly and causes the glue in the bend to stick to itself and come off the tape.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,Worked on Windows 10.  Image quality is just OK.  I use it to verify that a piece of plastic filler spout had gone down a Catepillar oil filler spout.  If it hadn't been bright yellow I probably would have missed it.,41,26

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,"The pix are clear only if you have additional lighting in dark places.  The light provided by the built in LEDs is woefully inadequate.  The software to run the camera is dangerous.  You can't select where it installs and it self installed on my recovery drive (which would have ruined it) but finally was removed with much effort and sweat.  As it turns out, I didn't need their software anyway.  My computer's built in camera software ran it just fine.  It recognized the USB camera and allowed me to select it and do much  more with the images.",98,29
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,Definately worth the purchase.  Windows application provided with the camera is easy to use and comprehendsive in terms of functionality.  Applications for this 5 meter long canmrra with sufficently bright LEDs to illuminate the picture.,35,30

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,Took a long time to find an app that works with it but I did finally get it to work occasionally on my phone. The picture is very coarse and unfocused. I do find it somewhat useful in very small spaces but if you could fit a larger camera I would look for a 7mm or 8mm one instead. This will fit the barrel of a 22 rifle.,68,53
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,Not impressed at all. I would have to rate the quality of the image worse than the camera from the first camera phone.,23,54

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,"Needed this for duct work inspection, but the focal length of the camera is 5 to 6 feet away like a cell phone or USB computer camera.  So anything within 12-24 inches of the camera are out of focus.
Its really like this just a standard pinhole spy cam with a really long USB cord attached to it.  Adjustable LEDs work fine except you can't completely turn them off.  Even at their minimal setting they are extremely bright which just means harsh reflections inside anything metallic like a duct.  I assume they did this to prevent these things from being abused as spy cams so some would see it and know they are being recorded.  But that totally negates its use as a scope in a reflective environment.

Maybe I just got one that didn't have its focal point adjusted correctly or something, but as it is it won't work as advertised.

One plus is that it would work on my cell phone with a 3rd party app and a micro USB converter.  But I had to send this one back in favor for another from ebay.",187,58
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,it's great for what it is.  I used this in combination with an USB to USB OTG adapter and Webcam software to turn my smart phone into an inspection camera.  Does everything I want it to do and best of all cost less than $25!,45,59

Cons: I did notice reduction in frames per second and clarity in low light conditions, (even with built-in light). The light only works well in confined spaces where there is very nearby  objects for the light to bounce off of.

MS Windows no longer recognized it..Tried it on different PC's running Windows10 and Vista... while it was working and when I tested it, things were great.. Image was clear and adjusting the LED lites worked fantastic.
 I am not sure if moisture got in the Camera Head or the USB Plug and Lite Control went bad. The plug end was extremely sloppy and loose. If I get another one, I will seal around cable/camera connection and beef up the USB plug. No Problem Getting Refund, So that was nice too.",124,69

Software is ok at best. Can easily view on laptop screen. Picture capture still eludes me. Beats the heck out of tearing a wall open to see in. Was able to easily observe outboard cylinder condition though spark plug hole, which is why is chose this one over one with a larger camera. But again, it's not a miracle and you need to be slow and patient. I have not yet tried to attach to smartphone.",102,81
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2,negative,"kind of hard to use, make out images as a mechanic. get a better one.",15,82
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,5,positive,"After reading reviews I wasn't sure if this would work or not but I gave it a try.  After plugging it into my USB port the LEDs came to life.  I didn't want to risk installing their software so I looked for an existing program to display the video.  I found that I could use the play capture device setting in VLC to stream the video on my windows computer with no issues.

Overall I'm very happy with the camera.  I used it to track a cable through a wall.  The small size helped (the camera is TINY) as I could easily fit it through the existing access point.  The LED brightness control worked as expected and allowed me to get a good image.  I was very happy with the focus range.  It was definitely a lot more than a few inches which seems to be an issue on some of the other similar cameras.  I used a coat hanger and later a fish tape to direct the camera where I wanted it to go.  This wasn't the easiest task but it was rather fun... like playing a video game.",190,83

The USB connector is so flimsy it rattles and I used electrical tape to hold is together so that it would not fall apart when plugging it in or worst unplugging.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,4,positive,"This would be 3 stars. But the price is just so great! I was in need of a scope to check a cylinder on an engine. Most of these run upwards of $200. However, I thought for the price, I would give it a try.

The video clarity isn't the best. I am sure there are similar products that have a higher quality.

However, at this price point? It really is hard to beat. If you are looking to read fine print inside of a dark hole, this may not be the best.

But to get an eye on the inside, and to do it quickly and at a low price point? It can't be beat.

I connected the camera to my fish tape and it was rugged enough to be fed into the pipe. I also used it to check one of my sinks. The LED lights at the end are not super bright, but bright enough to illuminate a 1"" to 4"" (or so) pipe.

They are not bright enough to light up dark areas more than about 5 or 6 cm away, but when you get close enough for the lights, to work, you are too close for the camera to focus.

Once I figured out which program to use on the computer, I put it behind the counter and it didn't take 30 seconds to see my ring. The image is reversed so it took some concentration to snag my ring with a hooked piece of wire, but once I did it came out fairly easy, Well worth $20, as opposed to a hasty kitchen remodeling project. If you do engine work or musical instrument repair this would be good for that too.

With this camera, you just cant see much detail  when looking inside something. It's just very low quality video in general.
At the same time, what can you expect for a $20 endoscope . I rolled the dice and it's not so hot. My bad...I won't return it, it's $20 worth of endoscope. I'd suggest probably look at ones that cost a bit more and maybe have some youtube video's showing the video quality.
This one is just not worth even the $20 , because you just cant see anything clearly so it's kind of useless. Yes, I cleaned the lens. I have many camera's, GoPro's and many other electronics all my life ...i'm the guy everyone calls to help or fix their stuff. Trust me, save your money.",204,153

Just used an adapter to plug it into my android tablet and with a webcam app it worked perfect. Never could get the PC to read the little CD, but didn't need it. This thing must have 20 ft of cable.
CON: The adjustable lights worked as advertised, but are so small they are not much good trying to see more than about 4-6 inches. Since I needed to see further in the dark, I taped a bright key chain type light onto the camera. That worked pretty well, but then it was hard to orient the camera so I knew which way was up.

Mine came without a software disc, but I didn't plan on using that anyways. Still the description says it comes with one so that brings the product down to 4 stars. ""UsbWebCamera"" on the Google Play store worked just fine for my purpose.

Along with this I purchased a $4 USB OTG adapter. So, I managed to connect this to a galaxy S5. Essentially, I now have a 720p camera with a 0.217"" (5.5mm) diameter at the end of a 16' cable connected to a pocket size HD display for <$25.

My wife uses it to check for ear infections/inflammation, so the small diameter really helps. We also have one that has a 0.276"" (7mm) camera. That will become my work one now, because it is just a little too big to shove in an ear...

The LED's are pretty bright and don't make the end too hot. The adjust-ability is also better than our other scope, even though it has a noticeable jump from medium to high intensity.

The included cable is too flexible to force the camera anywhere (a good thing as it increases where it can go).  The image is in color and detail is good.  You will need video software to use it (my laptop could not read the included CD and I could not find a manufacturer site to download it).  I was able to use Movie Maker (Win7) to view the camera.  I have the 15m version and purchased a 15m USB extension to attach to the cable should I need it.

I'm not talking long lush curly lashes here but certainly better than before. I think if you have good lashes to start, you would look great with this curler.

Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,It's my first time using a heated eyelash curler and I like it more than the manual clamp.  It works better once your mascara is on.

I cleaned it with a tissue afterwards so I hope it doesn't get too gloppy.,67,14

I stopped using mascara altogether, when previously that was the number one product I used - the one thing I wanted, even when I was in a rush and didn't have time for anything else.

This curler, when used together with a traditional clamp curler, is an absolute make-up godsend.  Clamp curlers have a tendency to make 90 degree angles in lashes, which is even more unattractive than no curl at all!  This curler takes the 'fold' out, and smoothly sweeps the lashes around and up until they look completely natural.  Took a little practice, but now I can get my lashes looking great in under 5 minutes.

One great feature is that when  you put  the top back on, it turns the switch off.",65,19
Luxury_Beauty,B002UXRDYG,4,positive,"It's not magic and it definitely takes patience but it does make a bit of a difference. It says to use the product after applying mascara but because I would rather not risk getting it caked with mascara, I choose to use it before I apply. It takes some several strokes to see a difference. It also doesn't get very hot, so it can rest on your eyelid and not bother you. That said, I wouldn't be concerned about the heating feature. I get the best results when I comb my lashes out first, use this heated eyelash curler second, then follow it with a clamp eyelash curler. Directly after this process, I apply my primer and then my mascara and my lashes look big and flawless. The process is not fast! It does take about 5 - 7 minutes. I would recommend turning on the curler (pushing the switch up so that the little red dot comes on) at the beginning of your makeup routine so that when you get to your lashes it's already warmed up and ready to go.

The mist is cool and slightly moisturizing without any daily long-term effects like greasiness or astringency. I've been using it a couple of weeks and had no breakouts which means it passed a major product test for me.

I can see where a mist would feel refreshing after working out, or during the summer. I think it's important to moisturize right after washing my face with clean water, to help retain the moisture. It's also my understanding that, under most circumstances, minerals and other nutrients work from the inside out, not sprayed on top just to evaporate.

I wash my face with a charcoal soap, then spray this on and allow it to dry naturally and apply my makeup as usual. I also use it when I need a refresher midday and before bed. I love it!",118,3
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,"This is a lot like the previous Vichy product I tried (Vichy Puret&eacute; Thermale 3-in-1 One Step Micellar Cleansing Water) but the application process is quite different. This is a product you just spray on your face, I kept my eyes closed when I did this and tried to keep it out of my hair. I left the spray on for a couple of minutes; the directions are vague in this regard. The product felt a bit sticky as the previous product from Vichy did but in this case the directions said to dry my face off after that vague amount of time and that helped with the stickiness.

The application was a bit off-putting for me. I didn't feel like it gave me enough control over how much went on my skin and where it went. Even after using it for two weeks I never felt completely comfortable with it. It did not irritate my very sensitive skin and the stickiness was removed with wiping it off.  But the application oddness and the fact that this product didn't do anything to improve my skin means I won't buy it.",190,4
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,"My wife won't put any chemicals or weird things on her skin. She sticks primarily to pure oil products that don't contain things such as alcohol or preservatives. She has tried Vichy a number of times after bathing and found it pleasant, but she feels inconclusive on its benefits. It is always difficult to determine whether certain products are really having a positive effect. This would include things such as skin care products, vitamins and food supplements. It can only be judged on a subjective level which is prone to all kinds of variables. Unless something has immediately caused a bad reaction or problem; tough to tell.
It seems that there is nothing bad in the Vichy, which is why she agreed to try it. So far she says its nice.",131,5
Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,4,positive,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.

This is a very nice and easy to use product that has become part of the daily routine.
Fine mist spray that moisturizes withour ever feeling greasy, or like you're wearing a mudpack.
So easy to spray and go, let it sit for a minute and gently dry.
Time will tell on the results, but my skin feels great.
The research backing up this product seems credible after an internet search.",82,6

Then she said her skin felt soft, and smooth.  The softness she noted lasted all day ....much longer than when she used lotion.  Unless product is extremely expensive, it looks like they've got a steady customer.

Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,5,positive,"I am familiar with Vichy products and have always had a positive experience with products from this brand.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a can of expensive water.  The bar was low for this.

Unfortunately, I had a skin reaction to a food allergy and my skin was dry, irritated, and a bumpy, broken out mess.  Having previously dealt with this condition, I know that it takes about 2 weeks to completely heal.  The Vichy Mineralizing Thermal Spray Water arrived on day 2 of my reaction.  Ive used it daily for the past 5-days and the bumps/irritation has almost completely disappeared.  The skin that Ive used it on is no longer itchy or dry.  I have no new bumps or dermatitis.

Im sold on this product.",128,8

Luxury_Beauty,B003BT6HNQ,2,negative,"I guess that I do not have the sophistication to appreciate a $18 can of mineral water that has 10.1 ounces in it. I used this product as directed and nothing..It is refreshing to spray on your face when it is clean, but I think that I can get the same effect by taking a spray bottle and using some good ol American mineral water.  I am not sure why the French mineral water is so much better than mineral water made any place else, but for 25 cents for a 20 ounce bottle compared to $18 I think that I will buy American mineral water. I am also a believer that your skin must be hydrated from the inside out. You can spray the entire can on your whole body, but if you have not put fluids inside your body, it is not going to do any good.  My entire family gets together on the 4th of July for a pool party and I plan to use the VICHY spray to keep me cool while Im sitting outside in the heat by the pool and plan to drink lots and lots of water to keep me hydrated.",198,14
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,"In comparison with other anti cellulite massagers this one does its job. The suction is very good, and i see improvement (I use maximum speed and maximum suction, cause light level would not work for me). As for device itself I give 5 stars, but I'm not agree with instructions how to use cream. The massager doesn't work without cream indeed, as the surface of the skin should be slippery,but the machine suck it out of  from the surface of  the skin,  and I have to put cream again and again, what a waste of product and money! I decided to put baby oil, work with the machine, and after I put cream.  This way  i get even better results, the machine slips better. But this is just my own experience. And of course I agree, without diet and proper exercises none massager is going to really help. By the way, regarding excersises,  I may suggest really good DVD to fight cellulite, that I use myself along with the massage, it is  ""Lower Body Workout"" from Ballet Body by Leah Sarago you can find it here on Amazon. it is challenging and very effective.",194,0

Of course it doesn't make any miracles, however if you combine it with regular exercise and diet, the results can be great!
I love the suction and the pulsation that it makes leaving your skin red which you can see it working deeply. Just be careful with the suction power because it can pick in your skin and it hurts. Also, always apply fat girl slim before you use it :))
So in love with this machine! I've always dreamed of something like that I can use at home because doing treatments at spa such as endermology or vela shape can cost a lot of money.
Highly recommended!",140,1

The suction power is definitely strong enough, and you can feel it even at the lowest level! The size of the machine is very good to use and too keep at home.

Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,Ok so I raved in my last review about how great this product was. It was actually that great (a bit painful but great nonetheless) and worked until it stopped suctioning 2 weeks in. What a disappointment!  I teetered on the verge of just trading it in for another one since it works so well but due to the fact that most people who have a problem with it complained about it stopping suction I figured it would only be a matter of time before the next one stopped working so I sadly it turned it back in. If it could have at least lasted 6 months it would be worth it but 2 weeks is surely not enough for the money spent on this product.,126,4

There is also no suction whatsoever - the vacuum part stopped working after just two times - don't waste your money - The product in theory is a good concept - If only the machine worked more than a total of 10 minutes before losing all suction",104,9

I tried the cream that came with it, and my own lotions. Checked the filter to make sure it was clean. No dice. Add to all of this that it's louder than my vacuum cleaner.

I've only had this thing for 3 days now and used it more then once a day each day with Nivea gel and let me tell ya -- it feels just like the professional machine at my salon.

I emailed their customer service, didn't hear back, so I called, and a rep said I would receive a phone call and email within 24 hours. It's been 4 days and I've heard nothing.

The product does take some getting used to.  I normally lay on my back and extend my leg into the air to get the back of the leg, especially where it connects to my rear.  I use just a bit of the Fat Girl Slim, and then use another layer of oil (almond/jojoba blend) to make is glide smoothly.

Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,"I love this product it worked!!!! Changed my shape,  reduced cellulite on the first use. The only down fall was I'm in Australia. So I needed a conversion plug to charge, other than that I would recommend to anybody.  LOVE IT",41,67
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,"bought this seeing reviews were pretty positive! I found it to be a waste of time, money and pain! It made it look worse? I guess if you have a dimples or 2 i can see it work! But if you have celliute a lot! Don't waste your money! I had high hopes and sad to see it failed to help n made it worse",65,68
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,Like the machine. Used only on one side of body to see if it really works. It does. Its just a matter of finding the time to dl it. It does take more that the time they say it does.,40,69
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,it does not vibrate nor suction even after using more cream---would not recommend it to any of my friends or enemies,21,70
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,1,negative,"I really wish I hadn't dished out so much money on this device.  I clearly had a moment where I wasn't thinking straight.

To start, this little machine is hard and awkward to maneuver. You need so much oil to keep it rolling along smoothly.  The lower suction settings feel as if they are doing nothing, the higher ones actually left bruises on my hips and thighs.

However, I persevered, and used it as directed.  Well, my cellulite starting looking WORSE.  Still, I kept at it, thinking perhaps this was all part of the process.

Frustrated with the fact that my cellulite was even more noticeable, I  started reading up on cellulite, and discovered that devices like these can actually make the problem worse.  The skin in the areas where you have cellulite is often already very fragile and thin- and suction can further break down the collagen and connective fibers (according to what I read).

I wouldn't recommend this machine and wish I could send it back- it's essentially a $140 pos that is now retired to my bathroom cabinet after a very brief life.",186,71
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,"I bought this little wonder a couple of months ago,and let me tell you guys,it works!
You have to be very dilligent and patient,and  do it every single day.
My skin improves a lot when I'm using it,the back of my thighs and inner thighs feel tighter,and the skin is more supple and soft than before. The machine works perfectly,the only thing that bothers me is the little filter mesh that you have to clean everytime you use the machine. I used it so much that I finally lost the little filter,and I couldn't find where to buy the same one,so I basically got a piece of cheesecloth and shaped it so it could fit and voila,it works awesome.
It's an expensive machine,so if you are not going to do it everyday,don't buy it.
Oh,and do it with the Fatgirlslim cream,I have been trying several creams with it and that one works the best.
Good luck ladies!! :)",158,72
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,"I acknowledge of this wonderful machine reading one of my favorite magazines during a trip.

Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,"I've been using this for three weeks and saw smoother results on the 2nd day. You have to keep up with it to see results.

This is not a weight loss product, it just smoothes things over. I pair this up with pilates/light cardio and my legs are starting to look great.

I also like the lotion it comes with. It has a light smell and makes my skin soft for a long time.

One thing though, warn your husbands/boyfriends about this.. if you don't hit the release button soon enough, it can leave some hickie-like bruises on your legs and that can make for and awkward conversation!",108,74
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,5,positive,Works AWESOME..I had dramatic results in under 2 weeks. And saved a ton of money by doing it myself. Love it love it love it!!,25,75
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,4,positive,"The machine works as advertised - the suction can be slight or excruciating, it's up to you!  The only bad thing is it was difficult for me to move it back and forth, maybe it had to do with the amount of suction I had set...I'm able to move it one direction in one long strip and start again in a different area (or the same area).  I hope to see some results soon!",74,76
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,I like Bliss products.  But this is hard to hold and handle over all.  It also takes a lot more time than estimated by the company.  It also caused me pain fairly frequently.  Just not worth it in my opinion.,40,77

I NEVER PUT MY HAND IN HOLDER I USUALLY USE BOTH HANDS ON SIDE OF MACHINE AND PULL AWAY, LIFTING MY LEG TO A 90 DEGREE ANGLE AND RESTING MY FOOT ON MY BED.

Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,"bought this for my daughter to help with mild cellulite on the sides and back of her thighs. we saw little improvement after consistent use after 30days. she used it every night for about 2 weeks and then about every other night after, mainly because it was time consuming and worked better if she had assistance. we feel like some of the other product out there that use massage as the main source of bringing circulation to the skin would work as well or better. She is in good physical shape. about 135lbs. and very active. just recently noticed the dimpling after she had gained about 8lbs. probably heredity but I'm  sure it didn't hurt to try and improve smoothness and firm the area around the thighs. Just not worth the money for us",134,86
Luxury_Beauty,B00AHU3VQI,2,negative,"For something that makes such a fuss when you have it turned on, there should be that much more suction power.  This machine is SO LOUD. I rather try and use my hose attachment on my vacuum cleaner and attempt to suction my cellulite away that way instead.  I used it four times.  The fourth day of using it the machine started emitting this plastic burning smell. I regret wasting my time with this and this time, I really should have heeded the other reviewers' warnings. Thank you amazon for your excellent return policy and letting me return this seriously disappointing product.",102,87

After few uses, I think the only way for it to work well is to clip tiny piece by piece, very frustrated!",72,9

Since I was diagnosed with RA eight years ago I've really struggled with finding clippers that were small and easy to maneuver but also easy to hold.

Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,4,positive,"I love Epicuren and have used several of their products for years. This balm is one of my favorite Epicuren products and I recommend it to everyone. It's a little slicker and oilier than other lip balms and is very hydrating AND the hydration last the whole time I am wearing it! I actually started making my own lip balm after i couldn't find Epicuren when I moved however I recently rediscovered it and now it's in every bag. I find many other lip balms to be drying or waxy after awhile so I only use Epicuren or my own. I recommend this to everyone I know. Absolutely worth the price as I have thrown away many other more expensive lip balms because they hydrate for a little while and then are very drying.

 4 out of 5 stars because I preferred the older packaging (twist-up tube) for application but understand why they switched to a squeezable tube.",158,5
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,2,negative,Unlike the epicurean lip balm in the small container this one is too much in liquid form and is not long lasting.  I will not buy this again.,28,6
Luxury_Beauty,B00G05DWHM,1,negative,"This used to be my favorite lip balm. I used the one in the little pot or chapstick form for years. I loved the old version because it didn't have a sunscreen taste or smell, just the tea tree smell (I dislike sunscreen taste/smell in products, but you gotta use them!) it was smooth, and really moisturized my lips. It was my go to always, and kept me from getting burnt lips at the beach.  But, this new version is terrible. Not only is it sunscreen tasting, it's feels different, and I don't like the tube. Still searching for something as great as the old product ;(",107,7

Whether it's just temporary....I'm sure it is.  Like anything else, you have to use it faithfully.  It is time consuming but to me it's worth it.  Love how the polish makes my skin feel and even if I miss a day, it still feels soft.  I'm sure there may be other products out there that are cheaper and may do the same thing....Just don't like to waste my money on something I'm not sure of.  This stuff....I'm sure of.

I used the creme on my face at night, some dry areas, as I have combination skin, next morning, I noticed the drt areas were much smoother, and would last the whole day without much additional moisturising.",90,54
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,"I'd been watching the infomercial with Jane Seymour for quite awhile so I was excited to try this. I've noticed crepey skin in my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area when leaning over. I've used this consistently the past 2 weeks and have noticed no change at all in my skin. This product has an obnoxious scent that makes me cough, is a lot of work that needs to be kept up. I think that my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area looks even drier now than it did when I was using a simple inexpensive facial moisturizer in that area. The same results can probably be obtained by buying a gentle drugstore exfoliator along with a moisturizer for a lot less cost.",115,55
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,This is a good moisturizer and exfoliating product but no where near the miracle worker it claims to be and you might expect from the price.  I gave this to an older relative to try and she found it to be a pleasant enough product to use but way  overpriced for the tiny amount you get and what positive effects there are unfortunately only last for a short time.  Alas this is another product that does not spring from a  fountain of youth despite its claims.,86,56
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,"Ok, so assuming money is no object, this is a decent product. Exfoliator works well (not really for the face, more for the neck, chest, arms and body). I do love the moisturizer (body repair) it's thick and creamy (almost reminds me of my mother's old Ponds face cream). I will say that my skin feels great after a couple of weeks of use. Didn't really have a crepe problem, but I do have dry skin and some fine wrinkles. This duo does the job. However, the 4 star rating is discounting for the cost. This is really a 'trial' size, yet it is over $60 in cost. You can do better on your own using other products (I love Ahava products as well as Olay). I say shop around a bit or wait for the price to come down a bit.",142,57
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,5,positive,"I am 71 years old, and my once-beautiful skin has turned into crepe, especially on my forearms. I've used this Crepe Erase for 2 days and the difference is amazing. My skin is almost smooth, and feels soft. I love this product and will be using it a long time.

Highly Recommended",52,58
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,4,positive,"Ugh, as I get holder, my skin has more sag.  Even though I work out a lot and am a normal weight, my skin just looks looser. Thats a part of aging.

I was interested in trying this product combination to see if anything could be done about that crepe looking skin.  While, the crepe didn't completely disappear, the appearance is less.

Why I like this product:

* It has a very light pleasant scent.  So many products these days have heavy, artificial scents and I just cant tolerate that.

* The moisturizer really moisturizes without feeling super-greasy.  It is heavy enough to do the trick, but not so heavy that it feels like you want to wipe it off.

* The exfoliating gel feels good.  I was a bit concerned that this would be too drying for my skin, but I am happy to report that this isn't the case.

If you are looking for something that might just help your dry and aging skin, this might be for you.
Please note, no miracles will occur with the use of these products.  Your skin might just look a tad better.",191,59
Luxury_Beauty,B016M9UDQ8,2,negative,"I don't have a problem with crepiness, but I am beginning to see the very beginnings of something resembling it under my upper arms. Like yuck! (Aging really sucks.)

Naturally I'd be for anything that would forestall it. I was glad to try the Crepe Erase two part system (despite the name, which gives me the heebies.) The moisturizer is OK, the scrub like most average scrubs. So all I have to do is use a scrub and moisturize and it'll all be fine? Because regardless of what the company claims, after several weeks, I see zero change in my incipient underarm crepiness. If this product is supposed to make a difference, it's not doing a thing I can see.

Two stars cause the products aren't horrible, but minus three stars cause I don't see that they do at all what the manufacturer claims. You can get a similar result a lot cheaper with almost any moisturizer and sugar scrub for a LOT less. Pass.",165,60

Poor, over the top, and goofy voice acting; the most vexing score/music; just an overall goofball nature (but not a well-executed on).  The Smurfs don't even show up until like the 30 or 35 minute mark of a 70 min flick. But it entertained the kids (2 and 4).  So I give it 2 stars for that.",80,8

Even though all the packaging indicates it is the movie you know and love, it is not!  After I bought this for my wife & she was extremely disappointed that it wasn't the same movie, I did some digging.  Apparently the company that remastered the DVD used the United Kingdom dubbed version.  THIS CHANGES THE NAMES OF THE CHARACTERS, THE CHARACTER VOICES, & THE MUSIC.  Not sure why the company used the UK version or why they just didn't give you an option for having a language selection for US vs UK.  My guess as to why anyone who gave better than 2 stars for this movie 1. Never saw it as a kid, 2. Saw it in the UK & never in the US, 3. Just simply does not remember anything about the movie.  So, if you have no care about those things then by all means purchase away.  At least the story itself didn't change.

**Update**I had heard that a Canadian company had a US version of the movie, I ordered it and saddly not true, they also had the UK dub.",202,110

My mom got me the DVD for my birthday, not realizing that the dub was totally different then both American versions I remember from when I was a child. Both of us were very disappointed. She ended up getting the original VHS version for me. Because of this disappointment, I will likely do some research on DVD releases of old cartoons. Likely I will stick to buying old VHS tapes for my more favorite movies and shows (especially cartoons) in addition to DVDs.",93,112

We were very disappointed in the movie because the voices of the characters were not the familiar ones we remember, and they were definitely not the same as the cartoon episodes that were recently released.  Why would the voices be changed?  It really ruined the movie for us.  If we had known, we would never have purchased this movie.  For me sound is very important, and not only the voices, but the music as well was not the familiar tune or arrangements.  The sound quality was fine, but we did not enjoy the new voices and music.",121,113

I know my kids won't know the diference but I'm really upset with it and I won't be able to watch it.  Really thinking about sending it back.  Very upset and sad.",82,114

This is befor  smurfwtte  or baby smurf joined the family. Nor is Gargamel anywhere near it.  I had it On VHS and watched it  recently  the voice cast was changed I guess they thought the high pitch voices annoying  but I grew up with it now it sounds like  they're mumbling.  Worse yet  pewiys voice is very much like Johans  thats not an ugly voice just all wrong for him.  I think I'll give the dvd to my Godson and stick  to my vhs.",102,115

If you were hoping to get the American English dub, you'll be sorely disappointed with this release, because this one is the United Kingdom English dub, which is terrible in my opinion. The voice acting ranges from passable to terrible, and the songs with their lyrics aren't as catchy as the American English dub version. I'd give this one a serious pass unless you're that desperate to own a copy of the movie.

An important thing of note is that Imavision, a Canadian video distributor, also released this movie in North America with the English and French voice tracks, and that also has the United Kingdom English dub, which is how I first came to know this problem.",125,117

Only problem with this movie is that smurfs only come out in the movie maybe 20%.  The rest of the movie is about Pee-Wee and Yohan and the king.  But still the movie is great.  I ordered this movie as soon as I saw it on Amazon, but when I went to Target today, the movie was only $9.99.  Amazon charged me $13.57.  From now on, I'm going to check Target first before buying any movie from Amazon.  The four stars is for the movie, not the price.",113,118

We actually watched this movie as a family and my boys thought the Smurfs were so funny!  I will say they were a little anxious and disappointed that the Smurfs didn't appear until after 30 minutes, but when they did it was smurfing-fun!  If you are looking for a strictly - Smurf movie then this may not be the right one since it is only half-Smurfs (and I don't remember some of the popular Smurf characters like Smurfette and Gargamuel being in it either) but it is a classic cartoon movie and entertaining in itself.

Outside of the movie itself though the bonus features on this DVD were so much fun and you will leave watching them so much more ""in the know"" about Smurf lingo (my favorite) as well as character guide (a close #2) that will leave you knowing a bit about every smurf! Overall, this is a DVD that any Smurf fan will simply love!",180,120

By the way, are the smurfs supposed to replace the three lads, which I guess correspond to the Weird sisters in MacBeth.

Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4,positive,"I've been playing shakuhachi pipe flutes for about ten years now, and am now able to produce tones that sound pretty fair. But please be aware that it took months of casual practice before this was so.

With this style of flute you are essentially making your mouth be the mouthpiece.  The technique is not unlike getting a tone when blowing into a jug or glass soda bottle.  Your mouth needs to change shape some for each note as well.

I like this flute and take it with me when I'm out and about. By itself, or in drum and  hand instrument circles it sounds quite nice. I got applause from the other musicians last time I had a little solo with it. This flute can be surprisingly expressive.

It's also priced such that if something happens to it its no big deal.",143,0

BUT, I did do some research and I'm convinced that the utaguchi (the place on the instrument where you breathe) is too large.

Anyway, do plenty of research before you purchase this one.",72,4
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,4,positive,"Shakuhachi is hard to play, but it helps if you have experience with other wind instruments.  I was making decent tone within 15 minutes, and by the end of the evening can play an expressive range across 3 octaves.

The tuning on this for the low C is good, but the minor pentatonic seems a little off as you work your way up the scale (and is exacerbated in the higher registers), so I think some of the Pythagorean intervals could use some work (or maybe it's just my western ear).

But it works - I would definitely call it a beginner instrument, but the tone is strong and beautiful, and definitely musical.",113,5

No fault with the company or product, but only with the description- this is NOT an easy instrument to play. I'm experienced with tin whistles, and I could barely get a note out of it. A friend with several years of flute experience did a much better job, but still struggled to get anything melodic out of it. For the cheap price, it's worth the risk, but not recommended for novices.",83,7
Musical_Instruments,B0009V4678,1,negative,"It is very difficult to strike a note - any note, including off-key shrieking - on this flute. If I had to make a guess, the problem is that the edge one blows air across is NOT very cleanly cut. (Perhaps it has been damaged by handling, but it just doesn't look very well done.)

I can easily get a Turkish ney to play; it's played like a pop bottle.

The Wikipedia article on shakuhachi shows an instrument with a VERY sharp edge made on some sort of inlay. The instrument I received clearly lacks this sharp edge.",98,8

Musical_Instruments,B005AL3RG8,5,positive,"Excellent to use with a tuner so the tuner only listens to one pitch while tuning a string instrument.  Fair price, good quality.",23,25
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"Guitar came with all promised materials, although it had some cosmetic damage to the neck of the guitar (the seller did stipulate that due to the manufacture process this might occur). I don't think it harms the sound quality. Good guitar for someone just starting out and not worried about the instrument looking perfect.",54,0
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,I recommend buying this for beginners. The guitar design is ok but the sound is awesome. I did not recieve a eBook which is ok instead I got this thing which sounds like a kazoo. Very low price for an awesome guitar.,42,1
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"I like the guitar..its is nice cosidering how inexpensive it is. But it did not come with an ebook, like it claimed. Instead it came with a pitch pipe.",29,2
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,For $20 more I got an acoustic guitar from Musician's Friend (Rogue) that is MUCH better.,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,Strings broke the first time I tried to play it.,10,4
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,This is proof you get what you pay for. The wood it's made of is basically paper thin. I feel like if I strum too hard it will shatter. I'd say only a true beginner who can't spend more than $100 would be ok with this.,46,5
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"For a cheap beginner guitar, I understand the poor quality. But I don't see how anyone can learn to play on this thing. The strings don't even make a proper tone and had to be replaced. I recommend spending 30 more dollars and getting something a bit better.",48,6
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,Surprisingly had a vary pretty sound but felt awkward in hands while playing and the neck snapped do to humidity and heat. You get what you pay for tho good starter guitar,32,7
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"If you're thinking about buying this guitar don't it's not worth it. It has no trust bar, which means the more you play it the more out of tune it will get. I like how it looks, looks okay on my wall I guess but if you wanna buy a guitar even just to learn on. I suggest you spend the +$150 and get a really decent guitar you seriously won't regret it. And you definitely won't waste your money on a board with strings.",85,8
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,This guitar has started to break apart and it isn't even two years old. Very very poor quality. Not good.,20,9

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"I bought this at the request of my daughter for her birthday. She wanted a starter acoustic guitar because she hoped to learn how to play it. This product taught me the value of reading amazon reviews before purchasing anything. The guitar itself was scratched and banged up pretty bad when we got it. The decorative label on the front is a very cheaply put on sticker with bubbles on it. The case is thin poly-vinyl like material that had tears in it and the zipper broke on the second use.
More importantly, this guitar cannot be tuned. We have had it restrung, and I have taken it to three different music shops, and they all say the same thing - worst guitar they've ever seen.
You get what you pay for, that's for sure.",135,12
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"When I opened it I had a trusted friend tune it and the neck IMMEDIATELY started bowing and within the next day the frame cracked. Not only that, but you could see where they'd spray painted it black in the heart of it. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Even as a beginner, spring for a nicer guitar. This one wouldn't hold a tune for more than 3 seconds anyway, and the case was nothing more than a cheap bag. Not impressed.",80,13
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this guitar was broke right from the box. the kneck was broke loose from the body. would not recommend this guitar,21,14
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. It didn't come with the pitch pipe to tune it, it didn't come with the strap, it didn't come with the case, it didn't come with any extra strings or pics. It was supposed to come with all of that! I didn't complain because amazon is the middle man from what I understand and I had other more important issues to deal with at the time...and a big chunk of wood fell out of the guitar as soon as I lifted it out of the box. I'm not sure if it was a piece to this guitar or from another...",107,15
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,Chips everywhere the only good thing is came on time. Would return it but by time I do it will cost me more in the end.,26,16
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,this is the first guitar i have bought. I'm a beginner and amy friend is teaching me he had 20+ years of experience and he says the guitar has a good sound. the strings aren't that hard to tell apart the guitar does smell like chemicals when you first open it just let it vent out . over all i have no problems with it i think i got a lot more than what i paid for.,77,17
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,this product is very small if you wanted to play it or get lessons this wouldn't be the item to order spend the extra money on a real guitar,29,18

love it seller was great!!!!!!",27,22
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,As the previous posters mentioned it has an odor when you first open the box.  It is a Christmas gift so I let it air out in my work office for a week or so.  No smell now.  It was just the paint/lacquer.  Overall I'm quite pleased.  Several coworkers that are musicians noticed it in my office and looked it over.  They said the quality was actually quite good especially for the price.,73,23
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"Good starter guitar for a bigger.  My teenage son needed a beginner acoustic guitar for guitar class at his high school. My husband and I did not want to spend a lot of money and he ending up not liking it.  We thought this was a good start to see how well he takes care of the guitar before considering an expensive guitar.

  The bag it came with was a HUGE joke. VERY cheap and very thin.  Within a week of school the zipper on the bag broke. My husband fixed it... but it happened again.

  As far as I know nothing wrong with the guitar's sound",107,24
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,"My son is two and loves music! This is a sturdy child's guitar that seems like it was built to take a beating which in our house is pretty much guaranteed lol.
The only thing I had a slight issue with was the guitar arrived with some chips in the finish, but that may have occurred during shipment. But it's merely cosmetic damage and like I said it'll probably get more within its lifetime.",74,25
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"Horrible costumer service, my guitar had a problem and they wanted me to pay shipping to send it back, it was more then the cost of the guitar.
Bad quality !
Never go back again.
The guitar is in the trash it was cheaper to throw it out.
Bad experience !",51,26
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"I expected this to be a cheap guitar.  I expected it to smell like chemicals, as other posters warned.  I should have read further warnings, as I would have saved myself time, effort, and money.  This should not even be sold as a ""guitar""!  Maybe as decor....
I bought this for a little girl, who is trying to find her niche and was interested in picking up guitar.  She couldn't even get an idea of whether or not she would enjoy playing, since NO ONE could play this thing.  With every strum, it went out of tune.  Every. single. strum.  You would play a chord three times and every strum, it would be a different note, as the crap pegs failed to do their job.  A kazoo is more of an instrument than this thing.  What a waste.",138,27
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,This was a christmas gift for my husband and for the price was any awesome deal! It came fast and looked even better than in the picture.,27,28
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"Okay so the first thing is, I received a completely different guitar. I received a guitar that buzzes at the frets, Won't stay in tune, and when we tried to tune it, the last string broke 3 times. The one I was supposed to get was a Barcelona according to the images. But I got a Crescent which is a very cheaply made guitar. I smelled chemicals coming off of it. You can tell where paint was sprayed on, and paint drippings. I'm sorry but I don't like this guitar. I do not think it was worth it. I was good at first though.",104,29
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"This is a classical guitar with steel strings on it. Doesn't stay tuned, sounds like crap. Even for the low cost, it's
not worth it at all.",27,30
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"This is a good beginner guitar.

Dislikes: The guitar is a little smaller than expected
There are minor damages and scratches
The delivery was late
Strap is a little small

Likes:Holds a pitch well
Many replacement strings
Beautiful color and tone
Very affordable

Overall a great guitar for the price, and would recommend this guitar to start up beginners.",59,31

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"i bought this thinking that it would help me get used to high tension strings(being a ukulele player) i was excited to get one of these guitars. Sadly, after putting on nylon strings then acoustic steel strings, the neck of the guitar couldn't take the tension. Long story short, the guitar broke in half. This is a waste of money for people seriously about playing guitar; however, i did make good use of the spare parts. (tuners, picks, strap, gig bag, strap peg etc.)",84,36
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,"A cutaway is used to gain access to the upper frets. Any child learning on this guitar will be bale to play bar chords further up the neck that a traditional guitar. I thought the finish was good, the guitar solid. It is an excellent beginners guitar, and the cutaway for upper fret access is simply a bonus.",58,37

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"The body is too lightweight, it feels like i could break it with my hands. Strings are cheap and the tuning screws
are cheap and do not hold a tune, which is replaceable, except i think i might actually bend the neck with real strings, and replacing t he tuning screws is too much work to be done on a ""finished"" product, at least in my opinion. Bag is not padded at all, so its basically an oversized ziploc.",79,40

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"I ordered two guitars off Amazon for my daughters who have been taking lessons a few weeks with passed-down gear. We just wanted to get something cheap, but serviceable, until we were sure they would stick with it. This was the second one to arrive. It wasn't even the guitar we ordered (came in different color). My oldest daughter decided she liked it better than the one that came for. My younger daughter, however, has a much more discerning ear, and found both to have a lousy sound. Very tinny. This model seems to hold its tune a little better than I would have expected, though. One of the reasons we bought this is that it was listed for around $20 but was originally $120, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. I think the seller exaggerated the original price to make the product look better and then offered it at a discount. Don't be ripped off. Don't buy it.",164,44

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"The first time I played the guitar the string broke and when I brought it to Sam Ash to have it fixed they told me I couldn't do it because it was actually warped, probably from being stored in an improper temperature setting....I definitely would not recommend this!",48,53

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,i hate it.it's was a waste of money and I had to go to another store to buy a $100.00 one because even my college professor told me that I couldn't learn guitar with this poorly made one.,38,55
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,"I wanted a cheap guitar to be able to carry around to beaches and overseas without fear of being damaged or stolen. This was a bargain so I didn't think too much. It looks way better than it costs (color natural) and it sounds very decent. I am tuning it using a simple free program (it was not available when I was a kid!) and it sounds great. The strings look fine, much better and softer than I hoped for, plus it comes with two spare strings (E & B) which is nice. It lacks fret markings and the golden color on the frets is already dissipating, but who cares. The neck is super straight and the wood seems of better quality than I bargained for. The bag is made of very thin and weak material that does not look it will survive much travel, but then I am not a traveling musician. The pitch pipe is useless. The stripe looks strong and fine, I don't know why would other customers complain about it. The shipping and delivery was prompt. I am very satisfied -- definitely more than worth the money!",191,56

Pros-
-beautiful guitar
-awesome price
-perfect beginner guitar

Cons-
-the strings weren't on correctly

Other than those 2 cons everything else about this was good. So if you can change the strings and don't mind getting the bag i would suggest this.",68,57

It is true that it is very cheap, but I expected at least functioning.
I should first find out that was Chinese. The strings are far from the neck, so it is almost impossible to play. The sound is bad, specially one rope.
I do not recommend it at all.",60,59

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,This guitar is excellent for beginners the only thing is that when you put it inside the case you have to re-tune it when you take it back out. but that is to be expected from a guitar this cheap. but i highly recommend it for up and coming guitar players who want to test the waters of this instrument without paying 100 dollars for a good one and then not liking it.  also another kinda off thing is that the pitch pipe is a little off key... (how ironic right?) but you can look on youtube and and follow a tutorial on how to tune your guitar there...so its not a a really big deal. also i noticed alot of people complaining about a chemical smell ..i did not experience that. i guess it has to do with the color of your guitar or something..and also this seller says that they will give you a learning the guitar book but its not a hard copy its an email so if it doesn't show up in the mail with the guitar case just know that its not a mistake...check your email ..all in all i think its an excellent guitar for the price..,203,68

Unfortunately, at his 2nd lesson of the class we discovered that this was just a toy and not a good guitar to truly learn the art of playing the guitar.  The instructor stated that the guitar did not have truss holes and therefore would not maintain the correct tune. I requested to send it back and only discovered the cost to ship it back was more than half the cost of the guitar ($22 return shipment).  Now I am stuck with a guitar that is of no use.",119,72

It arrived in safe packaging, 1 day after est date. But, item was not the brand pictured and did not come with everything.

Item received is a Crescent brand. Item pictured is Barcelona. I did not get a case, strap or pitch pipe. It came with extra strings and one pick. Otherwise, the guitar is in almost perfect shape, a little blemish on the front wood. Have not tuned/played it yet, so can't comment on the sound.",83,97
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,I got what I paid for in a timely manner but I was too embarassed to give it as the gift it was intended to be.  the quality is so poor it is a frustration to attempt to play it.  The strings are so far from the frets it can't be played and there is no adjustment.,57,98

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"I have been looking for another guitar since mine was destroyed in an accident. This guitar is a great little starter guitar. I have been looking for another full size guitar and happened across this one. And for the price i could not pass it up. I thought that a 38"" guitar was a little bigger then i remember but again for the price you can't go wrong. The strap is shorter then I can use but being lightweight that is not really an issue. I would highly recommend this guitar to others as a great gift for kids or anyone as a starter and something to learn on.",109,112
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,"Bought this package for under $25.  It is a great

way to get your kid started.
It has everything you need.  It is not a high end guitar, it is what it says... a starter.  Once your kid gets really into it, you can actually make an investment in a higher quality guitar.

It arrived in great condition and I have absolutely no complaints.

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"Agreed that for this price we should not expect for a good quality but at least the guitar should be playable for beginners to learn.

I noticed the following problems which i had to fix it myself when i got my shipment.

The height of the saddle was to short which resulted in strings touching the neck and frets producing irritating sounds.
No Position Markers
The vendor provides a belt, but there were no hooks on the body to attach with

The only thing i liked was, its very light in weight.",92,119
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,The guitar is improperly built. The tuning pegs need to turn too far. The neck is barely attached to the body. The instrument won't stay in tune long enough to play a chord. Do not buy this.,37,120

as soon as I opened the box I expected to smell the bad odor as everyone was complaining about, no odor.

oh, and an e-book stands for ELECTRONIC book, you can download it from your email.

I also tuned this guitar just fine.",51,125
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,This guitar is only for learning... It's very cheaply made but works as a teaching tool... I only still have the guitar because the bag was cheap and ripped,29,126
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,"So , I just got this guitar like a month ago , and I can honestly say that I love it . It came like 2 days after I ordered it , which is excellent . The only problems I had with this item was trying to tune it and trying to figure out how to attach the strap ( I only had one peg for the strap ) . The smell of the guitar , which people say it smelt chemical , was actually the smell of the wood when it has some kind of preservative so it won't rot . Overall , I am very pleased with this guitar . I really want to play it , but one of strings popped so I have to wait to get new ones . The End . K bye !",140,127
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,DON'T BUY THIS GUITAR!!!!!!! I hate this guitar. I bought it and the sound is horrible. It also has this bad plastic smell witch won't go away. The strings are high off the fret. Don't waste your money. It is so not worth it.,44,128
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,The guitar is good for its price. I received what I paid for. The guitar sound great as well. I'm happy with my purchase.,24,129
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"This guitar came in pretty quickly and with all the advertised accessories. But the guitar itself is a piece of crap. It was manufactured in a way that no matter how much you try and tune it, it always sounds off. Save yourself some grief and invest in a more expensive instrument.",52,130
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,I was not pleased with this product because it did not come with a cord guide or dot on the instrument for finger placement.,24,131
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"We bought this product so my daughter could learn to play... Not a good idea. The guitar is so poorly made that it never got tuned.  She took it to a guitar place and they told her that it would get untuned as soon as she started playing, and so it did....the worse $17 I ever spent...and I paid $12 in shipping.",62,132
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"The guitar is awful-it can't be tuned,the gap between the guitar and the strings is too big, not possible to play barre-spend few extra dollars and buy better guitar you will be able to play.",35,133
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,Good product and was shipped in a timely fashion!  The wrong product was shipped to us and there was no problem at all returning the wrong item to have it replaced with the correct item.,35,134
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"The guitar came with all the accessories mentioned in the description, and was in new condition. However, this guitar was made SO BADLY that the frets were in the wrong positions (some of them were a few millimeters off), meaning that it was IMPOSSIBLE to play this guitar without it sounding completely, utterly horrible. I was not able to play without having earplugs in my ears.
I didn't expect much for such a cheap guitar, but you should at least be able to play it. This, however, was painful for my ears.
Invest a couple bucks more!!",97,135
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"I bought this guitar because it was cheap. I did review the reviews about it because I knew a cheap guitar wasn't going to sound like a great guitar, but I thought it would be good enough for what I needed it for. My biggest problems with it is that it will not stay in tune. Also, you cannot tune it against itself using the fifth fret....you have to use a tuner. Even when you use an electronic tuner, it still sounds off. Now, if you have a kid who thinks they want to learn to play the guitar and you don't want to spend the money, I say it's worth it. If they love it you can always spend more of the big bucks later. I bought it because I have some people I work with who might very well put a giant hole in it with no warning. For that, I'm ok with it.",156,136
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"The guitar is Ok !!
No easy tuner and no E-book as the Description !!! How you guys tall about this !?",22,137

Knew this one would be smaller.. But wasn't prepared for what i got... It looks horrible, nothing like the picture almost spray painted looking.. We already covered it in stickers.. It does play tho.. Good for a toddler to trash not even worth the money for a beginner any older..",85,141
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,2,negative,"I enjoyed the guitar, the paint job is for quality, there are noticeable paint marks on the guitar. and the strap on guitar does it work you only have one clip at the bottom of the guitar for this crap and the other end of other doesn't have one",49,142
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"Was glad to see that it came just two days after ordering when it said it would take a week.

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"Received the guitar before the estimated delivery date. Smelt like spray paint, but not too strongly. A string was broken, already so I went to use the replacement strings, and the one needed was far too short. Contacted the seller and they said they'd send me new strings at least.

The ebook was just some pdf file from a completely free website. Anyone can download the ""ebook"" at any point regardless of guitar purchase. [...] The pdf explains that you now own a guitar and it has strings. If you touch the strings it will make noises. Probably the most informative thing ever.

Guitar is not tuned of course. Best to have someone else tune it for you as the pitch pipe takes practice to actually use. Not exactly beginner friendly.

Sounds just fine, and feels durable.",137,146

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,5,positive,"Got this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. Hasn't had a lot of time to play it yet but my husband (who is a guitar player) tuned it for him and he started strumming immediately. We also got him some cool rock guitar song books so I'm sure he will be playing in no time. It's nice that it comes with the bag and extra strings because one of the strings broke when my husband was tuning it (my husband says it is common for strings to break and it happens all the time when he is playing so this is not a defect or knock on the quality).  My husband also said that it will sound a little ""twangy"" for a little while until the strings are broken in.  We almost bought a 30"" guitar but I am glad we went with the bigger guitar because I think the 30"" would have been too small for him and he is not a big child.  He will be able to play this for much longer than if we had purchased the smaller guitar.  Very good purchase for the price.",195,155

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,decent guitar for a beginner i would suggest changing the strings if you buy this guitar the ones provided are not of good quality...with better strings you can get a good sound from it but i experienced some fret buzzing around the 10th and 11th fret on the 6th and 5th but other than that its something good to buy for a beginner,63,157

Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,4,positive,"I got my guitar and within the first 20 minutes I had broke the E and B strings while tuning it. I just thought it was my inexperience so I took it to an experienced guitar player and the G string would not tune and broke while he tried. We used the replacement strings to restring the whole guitar and tuned it but the D string still sounds dead and the G string still will not tune and he said he believes it is because the strings are cheap strings and it needs new better quality strings. When we were trying to tune it we were using digital tuners not the pitch pipe that came with the guitar.

Like I said the deal is a great one but not perfect. The guitar is a good guitar but be prepared to have to buy better strings soon. But don't expect top quality all the way around when only paying $20.",159,160

But I was really disappointed despite the cost of it. It seriously look like a toy-guitar rather than a guitar. I'm just a beginner but the sound of it is really bad. You are going to regret not spending a little more money and buying a real guitar.",63,164
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"This is without a doubt, the biggest waste of hard earned $ that I have ever seen or heard. I can't play anything on it.

I got it for someone else, and imagine my embarrassment when she took it, played it, and out of it came the most horrible sound quality I have ever heard in my life.

I tried to contact the company, but they never responded.  Fortunately, after washing it by hand and then in the machine, I was able to remove the offending substance.",85,166
Musical_Instruments,B00ANP5JMG,1,negative,"I expected standard tuning knobs and fret inlays but the guitar I received had folk tuners and no inlays.

I bought it as a starter guitar for my younger brother because I didn't want to spend a lot of money if he didn't pick it up... It was garbage so he never played it. Bought him a more expensive one.

for me is the perfect expression pedal !!!!",60,0
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,"I've had this on my gigging board for over a year and I'm really pleased with it.  This replaced my EB VP jr which broke a string during a gig and in general I much prefer the DVP3.  Sound-wise I don't notice any difference in the swell rate but what I really like is the ability to adjust feel of the pedal and the added durability of not having a string. The rubber ""tread"" started slipping off the treadle so I pulled it off and replaced it with grip tape.  Maybe it doesn't look as cool but it's better than having a piece of rubber flapping around.  The only other thing I've noticed is that it started to squeak so I put a few drops of Tri-Flow around the center support of the hinge and it has been silent since. After 10+ years with various EB volume pedals I'm not going back!",152,1
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,"I bought this from another source at the same time I bought the Boss FV-500H from Amazon.
The Boss pedal is huge by comparison. The DVP3 is a much better size for me. It takes up less floor space and is very stable.
Even though they are both essentially the same pedal component wise, to me the DVP3 sounded better with less tone suck.
Of the two, this one is my favorite for either volume control or expression.
I'm back to buy another.",83,2
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,2,negative,"The volume change from off to full volume is not very uniform at all. For me it functions mostly like an on/off switch.
You can modify the taper for the expression output, but not the volume output.

Also, it doesn't stay heel down by itself, so using it to turn the volume completely off is difficult too.

Shame because the pedal build and appearance is good and it looks like it is very sturdy.

I contacted Dunlop about this and no response at all. Pedal is going in the garbage. No more Dunlop products for me.",96,3
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,"I tried a Morley WAH/Volume pedal before this one and did not like it. This pedal offers a very smooth action and a lot of travel which the Morley pedal did not have. It is a passive pedal but I have not noticed any tone loss. Also, the tension/resistance of the pedal can be adjusted. The pedal seems to be very solid and well-built and seems like it could take a beating. It's on the heavy side which I think is a good thing so it won't be sliding around. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this pedal and will buy again.",101,4
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,This pedal was great but with very little use failed.  I used it maybe 40 minutes and gently and it was done.  I would return it but by the time I used it is was past the return period $105 piece of junk.,43,5

Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,"Be carefull buying this. Eventually the pot loose the grip, so there s no way to keep the pedal in a stopped position.

The only replacemet aviable is buying another unit.",61,7
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,Came basically broken. The rocker was not strong enough to hold itself up and it had an ear-piercing squeakiness. Will not buy this again.,24,8
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,1,negative,"Immediately lost tension on the internal hinge/pivot shaft and lost CC range.  Foot pad just fllopped around - and this isn't associated with the external adjustable tension screw...this is the 2 smaller allen lock bolts inside the pedal that pinch the main hinge shaft.
Have opened twice to tighten those small allen lock bolts and it keeps happening - even after reducing the external tension adjust to a minimum.  Poor design.  Haven't even gotten to the frail mag strip.  This thing's a dog.

Sad because it has a very comfortable throw and very useful features.  Lighter weight and smaller footprint on the board as well vs. Boss FV.
Too bad...",110,9
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,"I really like the adjustment for tension feature on this pedal. It is constructed well, has some weight to it and doesn't feel 'cheap' at all. I would definetely get another one if I needed another pedal.",37,10
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4,positive,Seems to do what it need to do.  I feel like I want to tighten up the tension a bit as its really almost too easy to make a change with your foot.  I've only used it for one show so far but I'm sure it will perform as expected.,50,11

Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5,positive,I like this pedal. I did have it cut out on me once. I like the possibility of using as an expression pedal. That is why I bought it over the silver one. It is nice and big. It is better than the EB jr. that douchebag ambient players use. Be a man and buy this.,56,15
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,I bought these for my wife. They are defiantly not noise canceling not do they fit in your hear. Sound quality is average.,23,0
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,"Pros:
Sound was good
Construction was decent
Easy to connect
Charger cable included

Cons:
Wouldn't stay in my ear, had to push them in so hard that it hurt to wear them, and they still fell out
They allowed a lot of ambient noise pass-through (did not provide much background noise attenuation)
Couldn't connect them properly to my PC (maybe a PC driver issue, but don't have the time to mess around with it)
Difficult to switch between Bluetooth sources (had to manually turn one off to connect to the other, ie: phone and PC)",95,1
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,"Bad experience with these.  They connected to my phone via Bluetooth just fine, but any movement caused them to cut in and out.  I disconnected and reconnected several times, but the same result each time.  Upon arrival one of the ear cushions was missing from the package, so I had to scrounge up another one from another set of buds. The ear pieces would not stay in place and fell out of my ears constantly.  I tried different sized cushions but it was the design and/or weight that caused the issue. Can't recommend these at all.",96,2
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,"I would not purchase these again.  I've only used them three times and I've experienced problems each time.  I have static/ music breaking up even when phone is on my lap and headphones are charged.  Another issue I am having is with the left ear piece.  The little rubber part which sticks into your ear falls off when not in use.  I have traded it out with another headphones part, but it still seems to not fit.  I would recommend looking for another brand.",84,3
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,"In case you only want reviews from people who have actually purchased the item, I'm trying to figure out how to return them, never felt the need to do that before. One of the reasons that I purchased these headphone was they said they were also for running. That is laughable, they won't stay in your ears! I got so angry at these things that I had to settle down a bit before I wrote this. Every other set of in ear headphones that I have purchased has has three different cup sizes and I have never had a problem with anything falling out of my ears. Neither side will stay in, I was walking around the deck I am constructing and the sound went completely away. I reached up and both were gone. Found them about ten feet in back of me. Maybe if I duct tape them to another pair (non-bluetooth)...........",153,4
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,"These are not noise canceling, the volume is just set at a very high level. Even at the lowest volume setting on my iPhone, it is pretty loud. I could not raise the volume higher than 25%.  I had them on for 5 minutes and started to get a headache. I like loud music, but like the option to lower it to a soft level if needed. Even the female voice that announces the functions, ""Power on"" , ""Power off"", etc is very loud. Also, the keyboard on my iPhone would not function when connected to these earbuds. I tested these with my iPad as well, same issues with volume and keyboard.",112,5
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,Worked great when I got it.  Went to recharge it and won't recharge at all.,15,6
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,Very bad very very bad Th worst Headphones used,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,"The fit is great, the price is great, but this thing seems to pick up disturbance and drops the signal a little too often. Listening to music on these speakers reminds me of the days when the cool kids had sony disc players with 5 sec skip protection and had to walk around like ninjas to prevent the music from skipping. So long story short - it seems to work ok, but drops signals a lot.

Also the cable is too long and has a rubberyness to it, so it will slightly grip your skin. If you turn your head, the force of that grip may loosen the item from your ear. So you'll have to adjust it often. Just getting a tie and looping the loose cable will be good enough to prevent this issue.

I'd 100% buy again IF the thing didn't drop signal so much.",148,8
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,"They lasted for 8 runs... At first songs would skip, then it would turn off. I thought they were sweatproof, apparently they're not...",23,9
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,These are extremely uncomfortable in the ear.  You should look at getting something different.,14,10
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,Headphones really work great for the price.  I wear them when I work out and they stay in place.,19,11
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,"I was not happy when I got this product because I was looking to exchange earbuds to remove ones that were on the device because they were too big
I contact the seller it took multiple attempts for them to say they don't have them
But the orginal product is avertised with plastic earbuds replacements",55,12
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,"They get a clear signal, nice sound.
At first I really struggled to keep them in my ear, but then I figured out the rubber piece above the ear-bud is supposed to secure into the upper part of your ear.
Since then a great experience for a low cost.",49,13
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,The only earbuds that stay in my ears during my workout. I'm not too concerned with the quality of the sound but it seems to be pretty good. I wish they would give you more of a warning when they need to be charged but other than that I love these.,51,14
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,"I've been really impressed with this headset. I've used these working out, cycling, and on the bus to work. They have good range, and excellent battery life. They've lasted at least 5 hours in one use, which is way more than I would expect.",44,15
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,"Works very good for me, the battery charge works for about 3 hours, it's nice to work in the gym.",20,16
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,I received the headphones without one of the earbud pads.  They did send a new set to resolve this issue.  The headset is comfortable and I liked using it. The problem I am having with the headphones is that they lose the bluetooth connection even during a call.,48,17
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,The best NC Bluetooth headphones for the price.  Notice I didn't say the best headphones.  They don't cancel out much noise and the microphone isn't as clear as higher end headphones.  Also the range is pretty limited.  You don't want to be more than 10 ft. from your phone or other device otherwise it will drop the connection.  That being said I would absolutely purchase these again.  They are good deal.  I have a very nice Bose pair for flights with a lot of background noise and then this cheap pair for exercising and at the office.,97,18
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,Headphones stopped working after 40 days which is 10 days after the return policy. Extremely frustrated. Would have been decent headphones for the price if they still worked. I guess that's why they are cheap.,35,19
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,The device will not hold a charge. Also the proctor is too bulky. It keeps falling out of ears with movement.,21,20
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,"Worked great at first,but thrn got caught in the rain while running, lost volume and none of the controls worked. Put it into a bag of rice in the sun, and controls came back. But now every time  I sweat too much on a long run, the controls on the chord short out and stop working. (Can't even turn them off)",61,21
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,no bass. the sound quality is poor. the fit is uncomfortable. I can turn the volume up to max and still no bass.,23,22
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,"I realize they are designed a little different from other Bluetooth earbuds but these just barely work. The sound is good though my phone recognizes them only as keyboard and I can't type anything with them connected. They do fit my ears but it took quite a bit of work to get them to stay in and the little bit that sticks between the speaker and the outside makes it really awkward and does nothing to help.

Overall I wouldn't recommend them unless you want this very particular style. They are just too awkward but are ok for cheap Bluetooth earbuds. If want better ones I'd spend the little be extra to go a step up which I plan to do when I can.",124,23
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,"Yes, the included ear tips are too big for my ears.  No, these are not ""audiophile"" quality.
Fit was improved dramatically after spending about 10 seconds to remove the included tips and replace with some spares I had from another, older pair of earphones.  15 seconds, back in ears and problem solved.
Sound quality is certainly ""adequate"".  I haven't been able to get a tight enough seal to really drown out other sounds and get the deep bass of a good set of in-ear monitors, but for walking around, cord-free, the sound is far better than some I've owned over the years, and I have no complaints.  A few years ago you would have had to spend significant $$ for this sound quality in a cordless headphone.  For less than $20, they are fantastic.  I can't comment yet on battery life as they haven't died yet, after probably about 4 hours of use over a few days.  Pairing is a bit of a pain, works fine w/ my iPhone, but my laptop seems to think it is a keyboard, although it still works.",183,24
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,"I tried it... the earphone buds they give you are pretty crappy... so you'll have to get New ones...
The batter life is crap, so you'll have to buy something else eventually.. or.. just... Don't plan on it replacing your current crappy device...

I'm staring at mine right now.... just sitting there... waiting to be thrown away.

I shouldn't be biased--- At first it was great... I plug them in, Charged them up-- almost wrote a great review!.... but Now, I see them... Beeping that they have low power, 20 times, every 5 10 seconds DURING my music at the gym.... Telling me in some phony voice about ""battery low"".... It's great when they say Power On, and Power Off.. since it's helpful to know... but It's like... Shut UP-- I HEAR you.. the battery is low, just be quiet and let me hear my music, or my phone call... but then they shut off...

So if you wanna keep the battery at Full, Forever... then great. but if they're used for backup-- or.. ""when you need them"" headphones-- Buy new earbud covers, and have an extra charger cord ready-- for... I dunno, Whenever you need them. Battery life isn't very good.

Hope that helps.",205,25
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,"Good sound, really easy to pair with the iPhone 6, sometimes has issues with the volume level (although it might be with my phone).

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,Does not stay in your ear!! Uncomfortable and painful to wear. Sound quality is okay.,15,27
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,"This is perfect for running, and I mean it !!! It perfect.
It changes my keyboards I don't see predictive words when typing, when paired with my phone galaxy s5 after i disconnect it everything goes back to normal. I LOVE THIS WIRELESS HEADPHONE BLUETOOTH",45,28
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,Wore these on an approximately 3 hour trip on my Harley. Wasn't uncomfortable and I could hear them just fine over my bike at 70 MPH.,26,29
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,"For the price, these are certainly a great deal.  The sound is clear, the reception is good and the noise cancelling is good enough that I was able to hear my music clearly even riding on a motorbike on the highway.  My only complaint is that they don't stay in my ears - they come with multiple earbud sizes and I've tried them all, but even the one that fits the best still tends to fall out a little too often.  But, again, for the price I can't complain.",89,30
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,Disappointed. Its fine if I stay in the same room but don't go to the next room. At this price though what else should I expect. You get what you pay for as the ol saying goes.,37,31
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1,negative,Awful.  They fall out constantly and are huge.,8,32
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,"Pros:
+Bluetooth setup quick & easy
+ Uses standard micro USB cable for charging (included)

Cons:
- Comes with only one set of earpieces.  So if they aren't a good fit for you, you're out of luck.
- Sound is mediocre, at best.
- Volume control is flakey.  Inconsistent.  They work sometimes but usually don't.
-Charging port cover is flimsy and tough to open with a fingernail
- Even with the earpiece fully in your ear, the rest of the earphone body sticks out of your ear by nearly an inch.  I think this is primarily why they won't stay in your ears; too much leverage.

Would NOT recommend.  Poor ergonomics, very low quality, even for $20.",117,33
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2,negative,So far These earphones arnt the best. Their kinda bulky and it's not a clear sound at all. The base isn't great either. Also they kinda hurt you're ears after a while but I mean 20$ is Kinda a lot but I would have rather invested in a better pair. Anyways good luck,53,34

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5,positive,"Sound great, especially for being Bluetooth - super affordable for workout earphones! they stayed in pretty well when I ran, but it was a bit bulky on the actual earbuds. Overall, it's a great set of headphones as a backup and for doing activities! I will definitely be looking into more Bluetooth headphones that would look nicer for more business-like events! I love these though! I also received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",78,40
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4,positive,"These earbuds are pretty comfortable to wear. They are very stable in my ears and doesn't fall out by themselves. Pairing it through Bluetooth was easy and I didn't encounter any problems. The design of these earbuds are similar to a lot of other Bluetooth earbuds. I really like the little droplet design the added to them, but the color scheme is a bit dull for me. Sound quality on these earbuds are pretty good. I don't expect them to be the best since they're Bluetooth, but these are pretty do able. Overall pretty good Bluetooth headphones.

I received this in exchange for a honest review.",106,41

Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1,negative,"I bought 2 of these for purposes of Skype when gaming. Microphone 1 was basically dead on arrival. Would only record the faintest of sound no matter how close I was to microphone or how loud I spoke. I spent waaay too much time trying to troubleshoot the problem, including double-checking sound card drivers etc before just trying Microphone #2. Well didn't I feel dumb when #2 worked just fine?! Anyway, my results with a very limited sample size is equivalent to a coin flip... 2 bought, I dead, 1 works fine.

50/50 not good enough for me, I would not recommend this product.

As a side-note: I paid for next day shipping on these, it took UPS 7 days to deliver them to me, they changed their delivery date 4 times. What a waste! (not Amazon's fault).I live 9 miles from the biggest SoCal Amazon distribution center..",148,1
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4,positive,"I ended up returning this microphone, although it was easy to use, and good quality. I bought it to add voiceover to videos, but I didn't hear much difference in quality between using this microphone, and just using an app on my iPhone.",43,2

It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work, including the message waiting light. It is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter. I have tried several stores such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Walmart and Target to find an adapter (120VAC to 6V 100mA) and cannot find one. I have not been able to find one online either.

Office_Products,B00005N5Y2,2,negative,"After shopping around for a standard phone with callerID and no answering machine (no power outlet nearby), I came across this phone that had good ratings and was reasonably priced.
I like the look and feel of the phone. The buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good.
However, when the unit is wall mounted, the LCD display is angled down, and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it. Of course, that depends on how high your phone jack is, and how tall you are. I bought two of these phones and both locations I put them were too low to see without crouching down.
The other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well. I don't know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference. I could not try that because the unit did not come with an AC adapter, plus I have no power outlet close enough to reach.

However, this item is advertised as having 20 number memory, which is 10 ""one touch"" and 10 ""two touch"".  I have not been able to get the two touch feature to work.

I tried calling the customer support number.  I could never get an answer.  I was always put on a queue, waited for a couple of minutes, and then offered a  voicemail option or dropping the call.  I left messages, and never got a call back.  I (twice) tried recalling immediately after getting booted.  I tried for an hour.  No joy.

Office_Products,B000087L7C,1,negative,"I tried this lead about 15 years ago, and it was terrible. I tried it again, recently, and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be. Firstly, the lead is very light in color. You can barely see it, when writing on white paper. It's really more of a light pink, than a red, as well. Secondly, the lead is very brittle. It breaks constantly, even when writing with a light touch. I can barely write a few lines, without a breakage. Given this fact, I don't think this lead is useful for anything more than making check marks on papers. I certainly cannot do any serious writing with it. Lastly, it feels very strange to write with it. Granted it is not a graphite lead, the feel is still unusual, like trying to write with something made of wax. If this lead were not so brittle and light in color, it might be worthwhile, but alas, I simply can't use it.",170,17

Our pencil lead is actually graphite which can not be red sadly as it is a form of carbon :CC, This is actually very thin wax, the same kind found in color pencils. I love this!! It pairs off with the .5 steadler pencil I received as a gift nicely. it is not too brittle to the point that it breaks on contact, you must be soft with it and use many layers. One thing I learned is that you should only use about 1mm or 2mm of lead at a time coming out of the pencil!!

Without doing anything to it, the cradle fell apart because the plastic, yes plastic piece (rod)  connecting the cradle to the phones interior decided to snap off, all by its lonesome.  So while the exterior appears quite sturdy, the interior doesn't seem to have the same apparent durability.  That being said, I'm buying another one because this one lasted about 5 years, there aren't any other really nice phones stylistically speaking, and it did serve well while it lasted.

This corkboard is WONDERFUL!!!  I didn't use the stickies that came with it... - I actually attached it to an old window... it turned out great!!!  You have to use something like scissors to cut it.... heavy duty ones... not a knife or carpet cutter or something like that... So I used a pair of tin snips... It worked great, cut a straight line and the pieces fit neatly into the space of the window panes... but the kicker is I used Gorilla Glue... the one where you dampen one of the surfaces - I dampened the cork.  It worked beautifully and now I have a really cool bulletin board for my new office - adding to the Industrial Chic decor already there... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!",139,12

I ordered 2 packages of 4 tiles. I could only use 4 tiles as 3 of them broke (they are VERY FRAGILE!). DO NOT HOLD THEM ON THE CORNERS! Simple gravity will make them snap in half. I accidently broke 2 just by holding them on the corners and their own weight caused them to crumble.

Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,I have to rewrite my review. I gave this product more stars in the beginning. The sticky pieces wldnt work so I tried gluing the adhesive  to the back of the boards.  I used two sets and put all 8 pieces together. Within a week the adhesive pieces on the top part of the cork came loose. The cork started breaking in half and my children's artwork fell while I was gone. I had caught it a couple times when I was home and was able to stop the cork from breaking those times. I wld not recommended this product. The cork is not thick enough and even adding 3M adhesives didn't keep it on the wall. Waste of my money. I will have to purchase something else.,128,41

They left a few crumbs out of the package, but now that they're on the wall, I don't see any problem, and they look very rich with the darker colouring, as opposed to the usual, more bland corkboard squares you can buy.  I also did not use the adhesive that was in the packet with the squares;  I used Command Strips instead, both because I'm in a rental flat, and also because I just wanted to give the cork squares a solid foundation.

These are horrible quality; just taking them out of the wrapping they completely fell apart.  I hung a few of the tiles, and every time I pin something to them, brown cork dust falls everywhere.  Just disgusting and completely not worth the price.  Do not order these.",65,56
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,"order one batch of 4, like them, then ordered 2 more for a total of 12 individual boards.  The first four were every so slightly lighter than the 2nd batch, so I just intermingled them when installing to make it look intentional. The 4 pieces of double sided tape enclosed is not close to being enough mounting hardware, even the instructions said to use 6 at a minimum. I bought some heavy duty double sided mounting tape from big box retailer and used about 20 1"" squares of double sided tape per board. Any less and the board may still stick to the wall, but the parts without the tape were loose and easy to bump and break off, especially if the boards are actually used and not just on the wall as a decoration. The additional tape was especially important since this went behind a dart board, so pulling darts out with the minimal mounting tape would likely have left me with many damaged and broken boards.

The boards themselves are very nice, and do look very nice too, so it still gets 4 stars for that, but loses a star for the lack of proper mounting material.",199,57
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1,negative,"Would not recommend.  Right out of the package this was a crumbly mess.

I had hoped that the smell would go away but after a week in our garage they are not much better then on the day they were opened.,66,62
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4,positive,"A little flimsy and crumbly, but overall, I'm satisfied with these lil guys.  This darker brown color was a little harder to find than the standard cork, and the material is a little different, too.  As you can tell from the picture, it's not a smooth roll of corkboard or anything.  It's more like a bunch of little chunks formed together, which I think gives it kind of a neat, textured look.  Unlike a lot of other ones I looked at, these are a nice thickness making them suitable to use alone with push-pins.  They did make a mess when I put them up, and I'm not sure how well they would stand up to being taken down and remounted, but oh well.  Still worth it.  Oh -- I also attached them with tiny nails instead of even bothering with the adhesive squares.",143,63
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,"These squares are a nice color, sturdy and look nice. The major issue is there are not enough adhesive squares included with the package. The instructions clearly state that 6 adhesive squares allow for the best bond to the surface but only include enough for four per square.

Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5,positive,"The cork certainly looks like it could become crumbly if over-manipulated, which makes the fact that they arrived (all 4 sheets) in perfect condition all the more impressive: their corners were squared, and no chips or holes. I cut them to size with a razor blade, and puzzled them together around the bar section of my apartment's walls. Really adds some much needed comfort to these white walls; looks professional, and fantastic.

The provided sticky tabs are working for me at the moment, but if they do start to slip it's no chore whatsoever to hammer in some little nails. The surface is somewhat porous, meaning little nails would be completely invisible if positioned tactfully.

Fair value for the buck, which is becoming a rarity these days.",127,70

All of this and it has a pleasant smokey scent.",104,75
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2,negative,"I'm making a large idea wall in my office and gluing this onto corrugated plastic panels which will be attached to the wall.
The highly inadequate adhesive squares are completely pointless, as I want this stuff to stay attached to the wall for more than a day, and the sheetrocked walls in my office have some texture. (I'm using contact cement.) The edges of these squares are easy to damage and the detritus they shed is non stop. I only hope once I have it mounted and framed it with molding, it will cease to shed so many ""cork crumbs"".

The back is upright and fits right in the small of my back, providing very good support.  The height, without the lower section of the central shaft, is perfect and I love the foot-ring.

After a vigorous application of WD40 and a rubber mallet, I managed to disassemble the chair and remove the shortest of the three cylinders, which still left me with a nice tall stool and let me sit in it without needing to jump.

I measured my desk and the proper seat height for me (I'm tall) is 29 inches.  So even with high heals I would have to tippy-toe to get on my chair every time.

Instructions are one size fits all (I suspect seller uses the same instructions for several chair types - seems okay to me).  Now I'm not as mechanically inclined as I am computer savvy and assembled this chair by myself.

I wish I didn't have to return it, as I like the solid quality and sturdiness, but it's seat height is just too tall.  So my search continues.  Too bad.",129,46

Keep in mind that it's really an average drafting chair, but once you acknowledge that it is a great buy.",68,47
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,"This chair was cheaply priced, thus it was cheaply made. It does the job, but it is uncomfortable and falls apart frequently. Spend the money on a nice chair.

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,"The shipping was fast because I have a prime.
The stool was nice, but the handle for height extenders was broken, also the back pad base wasn't balanced. Why I didn't return it? Because I do have Studio class and I need it to I can draft.
It's easy to but it together if the back base were balanced.

Over all, I think it's worth $50 not $79.
You can buy it, but I think you need to look for something less money if you going to buy this stool.",90,61
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,"The chair was easy to assemble,  after it is assembled, I find it comfortable. I needed a chair which would allow me to set comfortable at a bar height for work at a computer over extended periods. This chair works well.",41,62
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,2,negative,There were some mixed reviews on this chair but I decided to take a chance on it.  There is very little padding on this chair and it seems no matter what I do I can't get the seat level.  I'm only keeping it because it is too much trouble to send it back.,53,63
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,1,negative,"The chair itself is of fair quality and assembled with ease ... the problem is with its comfort.

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,"I got this to use in my new sewing room because my new work table sits a lot higher than my old one.  When I got it all put together, though, it was too high.  No problem.  There are three pieces that connect the chair to the base, so I took out the middle one, put it back together and it's now the perfect height.  It was really easy to put together, no tools needed because it comes with its own allen wrench.  Love the foot rest.",87,68

Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,5,positive,The shipping was fast!!  Assembly was very easy.  My husband is a little handicapped so I assembled it for him and it was simple!,24,73
Office_Products,B000SMPIHK,4,positive,The instructions are sketchy. I had extra parts. I needed to use common sense to assemble it. The foot rest is a foot rest and will not support your body weight. For home use only. Nice product.,37,74

Office_Products,B001308IKK,1,negative,The phone connection remains on (does not hang up) when it is installed as a wall mounted device (the hook switch on the handset is not depressed when it is placed (in the vertical position) on the base). This is a design problem that can not be fixed. I contacted tech support: They are worthless.,55,7
Office_Products,B001308IKK,1,negative,"This product is the worse product ever! I just wanted some kind of cheap temporary phone before I found a better deal on a landline phone. Cheap definitely describes this product. It stopped working within a couple of days. It no longer called out; instead it would give a beeping tone.

Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,If you just need something as a backup phone its okay although its probably not a good one fore someone who is hard of hearing.,25,9
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,"My biggest complaint about this phone is that it is ridiculously light. The base itself constantly flops around on the desk like a dead fish as you handle the handset. The only way to keep it in place is to fasten it with the screw mounts or use some sort of double-sided tape.

Second, it has quite a bit of static. I'm not sure if this was a fluke, but my other handsets worked flawlessly while this one produced an audible click and pop as I moved the unit around the desk.

Finally, it is very, VERY basic. Not many features here...the keypad is lit, and it does have a volume control switch (loud or louder), but that is all. No caller ID, saved number features. In essence, this is a barebones, cheap, and ultimately disposable phone that you would only get if you quickly needed a device to talk.",150,10
Office_Products,B001308IKK,5,positive,"OK--I don't give it 5 stars unless it's good, does what I want, tastes great, or whomever I gived it to was happy. Merry CHRISTMAS and Happy New Year!!",29,11
Office_Products,B001308IKK,2,negative,"The phone works o.k.; however it has a very cheap feel to it and I do not expect it to last very long.

The problem is it is so light every time I answer the phone the base also lifts up and then falls.

If you are going to attach the phone to the wall this phone might be o.k. But if you are looking for a desk phone try something with a little more weight to it.",78,12

I would concur with other reviews that this product needs to be a little heftier for good, durable field use (come on, it's recycled plastic; it's not like the raw material is too expensive).  Given its short life and cost, this item is too expensive for what you get.",72,6

Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5,positive,"Works great, plastic is bendy when compared to a regular clipboard/hardboard material so if you need a ""rock-hard"" platform to do your work, look elsewhere.

Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,I had one that suddenly sent my printer into convultions and it appeared that my hearty but old printer was done when infact it was due to a faulty cartridge from these guys. I had bought a set of four and when I replaced it with another cartridge the malfunction stopped but suddenly there was a huge puddle of ink oozing out of my 940c. This ooze is ongoing and it is very messy. It left a large amount of ink inside of the printer which is hard to remove and it will continue to leak out under the printer. Thank god for cheap ink that is water soluble but none the less these cartridges are no bargain. It will take days for my fingers to turn white again.,129,0
Office_Products,B001QIM102,1,negative,"I was very pleased with the service from this company, especially when they replaced one cartridge that didn't survive the mailing (no protective padding in the envelope).

I even surgically removed the barcode from the old HP original cartridge and attached it to the remanufactured one.  No go.  Bummer.  After looking on-line, I found that the culprit was probably a missing ""chip"" that HP installs in each of their cartridges.
My PSC is very old and still works like a champ, but the difficulty and expense of finding new ""official"" cartridges makes me as angry at HP as I am with the company that sold me cartridges that don't work.  Live and learn.......",135,1
Office_Products,B001QIM102,4,positive,I bought this because it seemed like a great deal; 4 black ink cartridges for the price that they change for 1/5 of an HP cartridge.  I installed it and it has worked well; so far so good.,38,2

I've tried one so far, and it needed to have its contacts cleaned with a pencil eraser to make it work, but one that was done, it works very well.

The corded (another issue) hand set sits on top of the speaker and mic and you cannot turn the speaker phone on with the hand set off of the cradle.

Not comforting to wake up the next morning and the blue 'paired' light is out on the Motorola and I have no idea when the thing dropped my cell phone.  More or less useless for that.  Calls placed out from the Motorola handset are not clear - there is static and folks on the other line have complained somewhat.  (When the very same call is switched directly to cell phone, the static miraculously disappears).  I wish I had gotten rid of the Motorola, but it's not really worth the hassle or shipping.",165,8

It takes some getting used to  - you press the first four of five digits  - nothing happens, then they all come out at once.  Why does it need to be that way?  (2) The intercom is difficult to use - you have to open a menu, select a handset by pressing the arrow key a bunch of times, then select it.  This is needless.  Obviously the person who designed the user interface never intended to use it themself.  (3) The message waiting indicator (if you are using phone company voice mail) is really small and hard to notice.  I would not recommend this phone.",131,10

The rubber feet didn't even make it out of the plastic packaging, so don't count on those staying on.  This, however, is not a big deal.  What is a big deal is that the aluminum frame is one piece with a joint at one corner.  The bends are fine, but the joint is not attached to anything and the entire frame pops off.  Sounds like a cosmetic issue, right?  Unfortunately the stand is part of the frame, so if you're planning on using the stand you'll have to figure out a way to keep the frame from springing off.  I had a board I bought from a store once that had a ""metallic"" finish that was also a dry-erase/magnetic board, but unfortunately I can't find it again.  Guess I'll have to keep looking.",145,13
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2,negative,"I bought this for displaying my band magnets at my merch table, and liked that it had an easel back.  I won't be able to use it as intended, and would not buy it again.

This board is white and magnetic on both sides (something cool I wasn't expecting) but it is cheaply made.  The complaint in the other review about the little plastic feet coming off straight out of the box is accurate for the one I received as well.  The metal frame around the board will not stay on--and it won't even pretend to.  It's like it's spring-loaded to pop away from the edge of the board.  Possibly these problems can be fixed with a little gorilla glue, but aftermarket consumer repair should not be necessary.  :-)

It also either came dented or dented very easily when I was taking it out of the package.

I was at Target after I had already ordered this item, and saw larger magnetic boards there for less money.  It would make more sense to me to buy one of those and set it on an easel stand of its own than to buy this particular board again.  That is probably what I'll end up doing.",204,14

Perfect for to do lists or whatnot. Writes and erases nicely with the Expo brand pens I have (not the pen it came with, which doesn't write well).

Cons: The marker that it comes with is cheap and completely cheesey, so you'll definitely want to get another if you plan to use this a lot. Also you'll need an eraser because it just comes with a tiny one on the cap of the marker which doesn't do the job. Also, the tiny black feet on the stand of the board have already fallen off (straight out of the box!), leaving a sticky residue in their place, and need to be glued back on.",138,15

The extender slide is positioned where my thumb won't accidentally activate it during use.  The blade is short enough to allow the package to be braced on a table to make it easier to cut.  It's just one of those designs that gets out of your way so you are focusing on the task instead of the tool.  My wife tried it and she found it easy to use as well.

So...this is something I feel fills a definite need. And although I'd like it better with a bigger, sharper blade (like an exacto knife), it was able to open most of the packs without problem (those very thick plastic casings didn't work very well). I think it's good to have around for general use, definitely helpful, but it may not work for -all- of your needs.",106,10

Why do companies think they need to package products like that? It's a waste.

So the safe cut package opener is supposed to take the pain out of opening those tough packages.

I tried it a few times, and it does indeed make those packages easier to open.

It doesn't work just like magic though. You've got to put a bit of effort into getting it to slice through the packaging and you've got to make a number of slices across the packages to get them open.

The mechanism to slide the blade in and out doesn't even lock. So much for safe. It also does not cut through tape with any relative ease at all.

The plastic piece that held the blade wasn't as substantial as I would have liked. The best part is the design which makes the utility fit quite snugly and firmly in the hand.

Because the blade is so small, you need to exert some pressure on packaging materials to make sure it cuts deep enough.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,"Don't expect a crazy difference, but it does the job. It works, the light looks cool in our camper van and actually helps our vision at night. Again, it is a small vent, don't expect big vent differences in temperature. I'm happy with this product. Sawed a hole in roof of fiberglass, went right in with some caulk. Vent is a tid bit noisy, again to be expected. It really does change the temperature, I can feel it if I move my hand under it and the other on the other side that isn't insulated and without a vent. About 10-20 degrees difference. Consider the price of purchasing the saw hole component when you purchase this- I think mine was about $40 at Home Depot.",125,11

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,It was noisy and only lasted six months.  Not worth the postage spent on it.,15,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,not worth the money as it moved literally NO AIR that I could sense.,14,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,Fan motor made some noise like it was out of round or balance so I returned it for my money back.  Otherwise it worked and looked nice.  If it were not for a bedroom application I would probably have kept it.,41,22

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,Don't buy this. Airflow is minimal & hardly worth the trouble. It just doesn't have enough power.,17,26

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,"Installed it and met my expectations. It doesn't move a great air volume but is the same with any other solar vent.
pros: you can invert air direccion in/out, Works at night by means of a rechargable bat, and has a cortesy light.
cons: doesn't move large air volume",49,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,2,negative,"I put the su force in my small greenhouse. Nice features. Not as much airflow as I expected. Then it quit working after a couple of weeks. I haven't had time to try customer service, so hopefully they will make it right.",42,29

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,"Looks good and runs fine so far. No more condensing on the boat interior.  Instructions are poor on setting switches. For anyone installing them, the reason they say 4 1/2 inch hole is that 4 1/4 is to small. It is not a tight fit in the 4 1/2  hole. Leaves room for doing an epoxy coating on deck or hatch coring.",62,40
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,1,negative,"It does not work, plain and simple. Instructions are pretty much useless and there is no way to mount this without taking the cover off and drilling your own holes.",30,41

we are using it to vent a greenhouse",21,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4,positive,"I'm still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so I can't vouch for their efficiency.  But, I wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is NOT 4.5"" or 5"" as stated in various comments here.

The instructions that come with the fan say cut a 4.5"" diameter hole using the template provided.  The template measures 4.25"" not 4.5"".  I cut a test 4.25"" hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat.

So, don't order that 4.5"" hole saw and mandrel for $50.  I used a $7 adjustable circle cutter that I got at Harbor Freight.  It worked fine.

I am replacing the Plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so I have the luxury of doing this work in my shop.

The only other comment that I have about the fan is that the SS cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates.

I have quite a condensation problem in my boat so I am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust.  I'll keep you posted.",201,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5,positive,"This solar vent was very easy to install, and can potentially replace one meant for a 3.5"" hole. On my boat, this replaced a 4.5"" vent leaving a little bit of a gap, but there is a 'beauty ring' included that hides any size difference quite well. The light is not enough to read by, but will help you see the other switches in the dark. The fan direction can be changed, and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night.
It looks great, easy to install, I'm very happy with it so far. It was 3 times cheaper than those available at West Marine, so time will tell how well this truly holds up in a marine environment.",130,49

Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,I am a professional groomer working out of my mobile van. After working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off the edge of my table while drying a dog I decided a change was in order. I have a metal edge on the perimeter of my grooming table. I drilled a 1/4 inch hole in metal on the edge and through the table. I removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4-20 bolt I mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside. I now can adjust the arm with my free hand while brushing and combing without the arm falling off the table edge.,119,0

Pet_Supplies,B00061MPN8,4,positive,"This is a pretty simple product and it does what it says it does.  My only minor complaints might be that, for a woman, the clamps are a little hard to squeeze open, which also tells you that they are sturdy and of good quality.

You should also know that the rubber tips on the ends of the clamps won't completely protect the edge of the table you clamp it to because parts of the metal clamp will still touch the table.  I would suggest using an old cloth or something like that as an extra cushion on the table where you clamp it on.

Overall, a good quality product.",110,4

The first day I attached it to my table, it got used on a matted doodle, and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat.
The doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker, so did that golden, it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose (my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard, would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile,)

On the positive side, he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on, even during/after swimming. If I were to order again, I would go a size smaller.

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,"This ramp did not do it for us.  It would not stay securely on the door ledge, and even if it did it was way too steep.  It is also very bulky.  The surface is sandpaperish, which I suspect did not feel too good on the dog's feet.",48,5
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,"Our 15 year old cat loves to scamper up this ramp to reach his food bowl in our kitchen.
We put nonslip feet on it so we could increase the ramp's height and incline, and decrease how far it sticks out in the room (smaller footprint).

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,"I injured my back and am unable to lift my 18# dog at this time. I needed to find a solution to this problem since he is not a jumper. I searched for a ramp that would work in my back seat (I have a 4 dr. sedan) of my mid-size car, not a van or suv. This Solvit Half Ramp is a littler narrower than most & it works for me at a slight angle.  He is able to go up the ramp to the back seat by himself.  The majority of the these ramps were made for vehicles other than sedan cars.  Fortunately, the width works for me.

The ramp is well designed,well constructed and extremely light at
7#'s.  The light weight design enables me to place the ramp in the front
seat area so I can use it again for unloading.  For me the car storage works better than the trunk because of my back. He is able to get out of the car reasonably well.

Very pleased with my purchase.",174,7

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,I tried to use this with my minivan and a larger dog with hind end weakness (a little less than 100lbs).  The ramp is too short for its supposed use.  The angle is too steep when used as shown in the picture and the ramp slipped and my dog fell when I put it on the lower lip.  It would work for a very small dog who can scamper up a steep incline but not by a dog which has any medical issues.,83,14

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,This is light and my 70lb 14year old golden retriever manages to get onto the backseat of my Audi A6 with slight difficulty. It only just fits the doorway to the back seat and it somewhat awkward in view of the limited space. It is very usable.,47,21

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,The ramp is too steep for the back of my suv.  When I went to send it back to the seller is would cost me $20 at the post office or $33 at UPS.  Not worth it.  I will just have to keep it since I only paid $44 for it,51,23
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,I dislike the surface material of the ramp. I had to cover ramp with a towel to avoid hurting my babies paws.,22,24
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,Ramp is too steep and my lab was afraid to get on it.,13,25
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,Wouldn't recommend because it doesn't hold stable to anything.  You have to brace it with your foot to keep it from moving while you use it.  Depending on what you are trying to do; that's not very convenient.,38,26

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,"Although the ramp description says it can be used on a couch/sofa there is no way to attach to the couch or cushions so it kept falling off .

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,"No.  I thought it would be sufficient to ""ramp"" from floor to bed,  Too steep for my little yorkie. He won't use it.  Instead I'm using it to block access to different areas.",33,30
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5,positive,This is great ramp because it is one-piece and lightweight. I use it to help a senior Yellow Lab get in and out of my car.

can use it with ease, rather than climbing steps.",24,36
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,I returned this item. Did not work at all for my dog. I don't see how it would work for any large dog.,23,37
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4,positive,The ramp came quickly and it is very sturdy. I have a subaru outback and it BARELY fits in the passenger door. I have to anchor it with my foot at the bottom so it stays put so my dog can climb into the back seat. I probably will try to put something along the bottom so it won't slide.! It would be great for a van where the door slides open instead of just opening.,76,38
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2,negative,"This ramp did not secure very well to my stairs; therefore, it wasn't safe for my pets to use.  The width of the ramp was good which was what attracted me in the first place but I had to return it because it didn't fit well.",46,39

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,"I bought this ramp because I  needed something for my dog that was not too bulky or heavy for me to use.  The material on the ramp is very slippery and my dog scratched it up and fell the first time he tried to get in the car.  Then it had scared him, so he would not try it again.  My dog is medium sized (50 lb).  Maybe it would work for small dogs.  I would not recommend this ramp.  I ordered a ramp with removable carpet from my local pet store and it works great.",96,42
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,This is not well designed and clumsy! I would not recommend this item to anyone with a sedan as it's too wide to fit in a back seat door opening.,30,43
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,1,negative,This item was too large/wide for the door opening for my SUV.  Probably works best for vans or sliding doors.,20,44

Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,5,positive,"I LOVE this stuff. I first purchased this product at Tractor Supply because it was on sale. I used to live in an apartment complex so my two dogs would play with about 10 other dogs daily, it was a dog oriented community and we loved it. Of course they got a lot of fleas within the first few days, bad enough to where there were fleas in the house and in my bed, so I had to try something. I didn't want to pay the outrageous $40 for the good stuff, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I have one dog who is about 15 lbs, and another who is about 35-40 lbs. So I got this to use with both of them. It was amazing. Within a day, if not hours, all the fleas were GONE, from my pets, my house, my bed (thank god!) and the product actually smells pretty good. An orangish, citrus smell. My dogs don't like when it's applied but I think thats because they don't like the squeezing noise when you apply it. overall, great product. It's the only thing i will ever buy in the future, plus it's a great price!",201,6
Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,"Seems to work on my 13 pound weiner dog.  It does appear to take a few days before it kicks in.

Pet_Supplies,B000X94LL2,4,positive,"I read before buying Sentry Pro that many of these topical flea medications can have alarming side effects. I did not use quite as much as recommended, rather gave my dog a really good flea bath and made sure she was dry before applying the product.  I haven't seen a single flea since and the dog had fleas pretty bad. I think it is important to mention I took several days to clean the house from top to bottom with borax & bleach and put a cheap flea collar in the vacuum cleaner bag in the days  immediately after recognizing I had a flea problem.  I wonder reading the negative comments if fleas infest the house if any product can be effective. Likely some people find it easier to use the more expensive brand and if I had the extras money perhaps I would have also, but I am satisfied as the product did what it promised.",157,11

How else to explain that some of the Chunky soups--which I have happily five-starred-- come from the same company that produced this watery, flavorless concoction? The soup depends upon the  thin yellowish-white stock to establish the ""cheese"" credential but its already mentioned lack of flavor means that whatever this product is, it lacks a crucial ingredient and the word ""cheese"" in the title  is simply misleading. The ""steak""  ingredient is several tiny thin pieces of meat.which lack the thickness, the heft, the substance and the flavor to resemble  the satisfactory beefiness of  even the worst  cheesesteak sandwich I enjoyed  while living in the Philadelphia area.  Finally, the necessary onion component is essentially missing here--I found a very few small pieces of onion so overprocessed  they lend scant flavor. There are also a very few very small potato cubes which, of course, have nothing to do with a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I truly urge you to bypass this product.",166,20

It's Chunky soup that doesn't taste like a sandwich, but I like it. There's really no surprises here and it's claim to fame would be that the beef chunks are pretty big.

But what you really need to do is pay attention to pricing on these Prime Pantry orders day to day, because when they're left in your cart a couple of days, you might see the overall price change to $30 higher, and then you find out that your cans of corn went from 6 to $36, or something even worse.

So the soup is typically decent Chunky, but really keep a close watch on the price changes in your cart.

I'll recommend this creamy soup that somehow doesn't taste like a sandwich.",139,33
Prime_Pantry,B00SGSL18S,4,positive,This soup is pretty good. It could use some more flavor and more meat because it is mostly potatoes. The meat to potato ratio is off. But it is filling and satisfying. I might order it again.,37,34

Since they are black, it's hard to see how much gunk they pull out of my pores. You will also need to use a heavy duty paper towel or inexpensive wash cloth to remove the black residue from your face. I am not sure how well it washes out of fabric. I use expensive wash clothes and as soon as I saw what was left on my face, I did not chance removing it with one of them. In the future I will stick with the white Bior strips since I prefer to see their effectiveness.",126,0

Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,I love the original Biore strips and thought these would be the next generation with improvements. I didn't get the sense that these were any better -- or even as good as -- the originals. I'll stick with those.,39,4
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,Cleanse your face and while still wet apply the strip to your nose.it sticks better if you fan dry it.any residue left on your skin comes off with cold water or toner which I recommend using to close your pores to prevent future breakouts.,44,5

Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,This is the first time I ever used a Biore Charcoal strip and it works better than the regular Biore strips which are the white ones. They makes me skin smoother and I feel like they definitely pull out more of the oil and dirt than the white Biore strips.,50,7
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,They really don't work well. I've used the regular kind too and always felt that they were nit very effective. I thought maybe with the charcoal aspect they might have improved but I was wrong and it was a waste of money.,42,8
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,"Tonight I tried Biore Pore Strips for the first time! I have a moderate amount of blackheads on my nose and cheeks; nothing that bothered me too much but I figured if I could get rid of them, why not? I washed my face, keeping my nose wet, and put the strip on. I left it on for the recommended 10 minutes. Even though I didn't think I had that many blackheads I was amazed by how much came out and how better my nose looked. It was a little hard to get off, but the results were fantastic and I will be using these weekly!",106,9
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,5,positive,"These work great on my boyfriend's oily, large-pored nose.

Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,4,positive,I have used MANY pore strips in the past including some homemade ones. I used these for the first time and I saw all the gunk come right out ! it was disgusting but pleasing to see a cheap product do its job so well! I was very pleased and will re purchase. The only downside would be the leftover black residue left around my nose but that came off quickly with a gentle exfoliator. I recommend.,77,15
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,Stick to the original.  These don't work as well.,9,16
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,2,negative,These are no better than the regular Biore strips but much more expensive!,13,17
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,I have used Biore strips FOREVER!!! Decided to give these charcoal strips a try. It seemed like they never really dried/hardened and I don't think they were as effective or effective at all at removing blackheads. Will not be buying again.,41,18
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,1,negative,"Original biore nose strips work wayyyyy better than this. I used 1 time and will not use the rest of the package, it didn't do anything",26,19
Prime_Pantry,B00U5MR6KA,4,positive,These pulled out some gunk from my pores but didn't work as well as I was hoping. 4 stars because my boyfriend had better luck than I did. I think it all depends on the shape of your nose!,39,20
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,Unpleasant.  There are others with better taste and same carbs,10,0
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,I wanted the like these but each flavor tasted exactly like the others. I was thrown off by the puffed rice texture when they was no rice in it. Gave them 2 stars because of the low calories and the convenient size. Otherwise I would be giving them one star.,50,1
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,"At first I thought these were a bit pricey, but when they arrived, I saw that these are MUCH bigger than the average energy/protein bars! Very filling, as well - in fact, I couldn't even get through an entire bar without feeling full already. So the price is actually very good for the amount. The bars are not what I expected as far as protein bars go. They are more like rice crispies... rather than a traditional bar. I loved the Lemon-Coconut a lot, but the Cinnamon and Peanut Butter ones were a little too dry for me.",98,2
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,"Without a doubt, one of the worst snack bars we have ever tried. No one in the family liked any of the flavors. We ended up tossing them out.",29,3
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,Did not care for the texture or taste of these bars,11,4
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,"Only the coconut lemon flavor really tastes good (surprisingly). Its hard to find a protein bar that has low sugar, high protein, and a decent taste so I'm happy I found these. Will be ordering the lemon coconut in the future.",41,5
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,"I like the taste of all three flavors, low ingredient list, high protein and fiber, low sugar...perfect bars for me. I order these regularly now.",25,6
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,"I'd give it zero, but I bought them at clearance price so I should have known. My bad.",18,7
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,"Not bad, just a bit different taste than I expected.  ;-]",11,8
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,"Not sure why people are complaining about the taste unless they are expecting a candy bar. All three flavors are unique and have reasonably good flavor. Texture and consistency is similar to a rice krispies treat, think light and puffy.",40,9
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,My go to breakfast bar! Great taste with lots of protein.,11,10
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,They kind of hurt your tongue but whatever it's food.,10,11
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,"Texture is simpler than expected, no pieces of nuts or other ingredients; but good flavor.",15,12
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,it is ok but they are small bars but good to low in sugar for diabetics.,16,13
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,"So far I tried the lemon coconut and the cinnamon pecan. They're okay tasting, but not easy to eat. I think because the bars are mostly made of puffed grain, so they are extremely dry. I'm not a big fan of the flavors, but it's nearly impossible to find a protein bar that tastes good and isn't a ton of sugar and calories, so I don't hold the flavor of these bars to a very high standard. I think as a quick supplement to hold you over until a better meal these are fine. I will finish the box and just remember to have a drink handy to help get them down.",112,14
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,"I've tried every protein bar out there, and Simply Protein is one of the best. It is not like the sticky pasty or cardboardy bars. These have texture simliar to rice crispy treat. The Lemon Coconut is my favorite.

Also the bar still tastes/looks good if I smoosh it at the bottom of my bag (unlike some other bars that melt or totally fall apart if they get smooshed)",69,15
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,Would not purchase again. Got the job done for a cross country move. Did not look appetizing and only tasted okay. Sticking with my Beachbars.,25,16

Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,4,positive,These taste good but I did not love them.,9,18
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,5,positive,"I don't understand all the negative remarks about a protein bar, what do people expect, to get the taste of a Snickers in a low sugar, high protien bar? If you want something with more taste, go buy a milky way or snickers. As for this product, it is as it states, a good protein bar. The lack of taste so to speak is because of the lesser amounts of sugar which I like.  I loved them.",77,19
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,"Should have listened to the other reviews. This bar is essentially dry puffed soy bits stuck together with a little flavoring. There really is not much to it other than that, and they don't particularly taste all that great either. The flavoring is very light and it's just an additive. I found one piece of coconut in the coconut bar. Just enough to be able to legally add it to the ingredients list on the back. Far and away over priced for what you get, which is essentially a small health food version of a rice krispy treat.",98,20
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,2,negative,"What an odd texture. Like rice crispies with a bit of flavor.
They are dry and crumble in your hand.",20,21
Prime_Pantry,B00UAK5KZK,1,negative,Yuck! I have to drink water after every bite just go get them down! So coconutty and dry!!,18,22
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,"I recently got an eTrex Summit GPS and bought this software in order to download the trips I take into a printable format as well as to plan hikes before starting out on them.  The bottom line is that this 3 CD-ROM set doesn't contain nearly enough information to do that. I took a 4 mile hike this weekend near San Francisco, and downloaded it to the software. It does show the track that we walked, but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can't tell that we went up and down, gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated. Furthermore, the road into the park wasn't drawn correctly, the ranger station and other services weren't marked and so on.  In short, the maps provided won't allow you to plan a hike, which was the point in the first place right?",155,0
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,"These maps contain a good amount of detail within the confines of existing technology.  The maps include dirt roads, hiking trails, streams, waypoint, and of course elevation changes. These maps cover the entire US and are used in conjunction with Garmin GPS units. I would recomend this software to anyone with a Garmin GPS who wants to camp or hike with their GPS as a navigation tool.  However, be aware they will not be accurate enough in many situations and you probably want to have a secondary navigation tool available to you.
My experience with the unit has primarily been driving through forest areas, and short hiking and camping outings.",110,1
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,"I bought the Garmin GPSMap 60CSx and about $400.00 worth of software.  I was under the impression that the TOPO US 2008 product was the digital equivalent of the USGS 24K - but due to space concerns I assumed it would be  perhaps half the resolution (otherwise my GPS would be the size and weight of a car battery).  I was greatly mistaken at how inaccurate it was. After reading many other reviews, I said heck with it and ignored the nay sayers in favor of purchasing it.  In my opinion, this item is worthless. I recommend that others avoid it.  Garmin's units are great, but their maps and licensing (especially the unlock wizards) are a joke.  I recommend buying another product altogether - the nay sayers are correct.",129,2
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,I found Mapsource to be a top rated program with a short learning curve. I Like It!,17,3
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,"I paid a lot of money for this CD upgrade for my Garmin, and  I still haven't downloaded it after a year.  I took it to two expert computer shops, and they can't do it. I went to website, downloaded countless updates and drivers, and it still won't work. I will never buy a Garmin product again.",57,4
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"It's taking me a while to get a hang of this product, but I'm able to download and upload tracks for my eTrex Legend, and that was my main goal. Trip planning also looks useful. It doesn't have many National Forest trails in it and the trails it does have are generally poorly labled. It's still a good way to make my GPS more useful and, possibly, avoid picking up too many free trail maps to clutter my gear closet. One gripe I  have, but may be me learning, is that you don't seem to be able to open a saved map file and then add a new track to it. That makes it hard to create a long-term record of one's hikes.",123,5
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"If you want more detail, then get the larger scale maps.  These serve the purpose of their scale (1:100,000).  If you need more detail then you will need MapSource US TOPO 24K, National Parks.  It has a scale of 1:24,000.  That Should be all the detail you need.  I only give 4 stars because it doesn't have some of the main trails of the northeast.",65,6
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,Good as long as you don't require detailed maps and topography. Certainly better than the base map pre-installed on most Garmin units but simply lacking in detail.,27,7
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,"They sent me version 3.02 so I have to download updates to get it up to version 6.x! Why do they send outdated versions and place the burden on the consumer? And of course you'll only realize your software is outdated when you have mind boggling problems getting it to work or even installed.

This is the way to drive away customers.",62,8
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"I bought this software mainly for use onscreen on my new 60CSX GPS, and so far it's been great for that.  I've also sampled some of the trip planning features on my laptop, and that's worked out well, too.  My only compliant is that the back roads aren't labeled on my GPS screen, so it makes it hard when I'm driving and want to know quickly what road I'm looking at, but the routes are pretty accurate, so I can usually identify by that.  Also, some of the data is out of date for those remote roads.  I've found a couple so far that are listed as roads, but have been converted to hiking trails, or reverted to elk trails, many years ago.  Coupled with a more detailed (and sometimes more recent, though not always) Forest Service map, it's just fine.  Well worth it for adding detail to your onscreen GPS maps.",152,9
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,"I love this product.  First copy this disk to your hard disk, and then install from there.  Then you don't have to used the CD each time you load the MapSource application.  Also be sure to download the latest version of MapSource from Garmin after you install the CD version.",50,10
Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,"Basically, what you would expect in a 1:24K topo set. The thing to be aware of is that these are topo maps, not trail maps, although they do seem to have a lot of the major trails on them. I'm using them to plan a trip to four national parks this fall.

One notable feature of this set is that it can be installed 100% onto the computer hard drive without jumping through any hoops. So, once you have installed the maps, you can put the CDs away for safekeeping.",90,11
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,"Their software is very bad. Difficult to use, expensive, full of errors and gives a lot of problems (a package costs over $100 and it doesn't even work).",28,12
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,"Mapsource TOPO US has out dated maps by at least 6-10 yr (in Pa.) and half the time the map dose not line up with the GPS with roads and elevation.  When I emailed them about update, I was told that the government sends them update and they haven't gotten any in a while.  To me it sounds like there depending on other people to do there work.  For the price they charge, they should be checking on the updates or doing them.",83,13
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,"Only get this mapset if you have a specific need for terrain information.  I was a little disappointed about how painfully out of date the trail information is and this only leads me to believe that some of the terrain information is probably outdated too.  Certainly, mountains don't change often, but some trail land does.  I got it for terrain information of Hawaii and it was adequate.  In this instance, there wasn't the option of using the National Park mapset.  I can't say personally, but I would hope the National Park mapset is more up to date.",97,14
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,I got this software a couple of months ago and I still haven't been able to figure out how to use it. The instructions that come along with the package assume you are a computer geek.  Pass on this unless you have a lot of time to try and figure out how to make good use of it.,58,15

Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,"Many people have complained about the inaccuracies and lack of detail that Garmin's Topo software provides, However, I am completely satisfied with this product.

  It has more than adequate detail for my hiking and mountain biking needs, and provides a ton of additional roadways over the basemap. Those of you who just intend on getting by with your basemap don't know what you're missing!

  If you intend on doing a lot of out of state travel you would be wise to also invest in Garmin's City Navigator software which places more emphasis on maps of major metro areas.

  The software is a joy to use, requiring little effort to copy maps onto a compatible GPS. Also, Mapsource Topo does not require an unlock like other Garmin products, just install and go!",131,17
Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,Not for the serious hiker. This map is way off on its accuracy. Want to plan a hike on your PC before hand....Forget it. Contours are 100 ft. incurements. Very limited reference points. Actually had me on the wrong side of a creek. No bench mark refferences. Use your Garman Gps it's a great tool. But don't waste your time or money with this map. Stick to your USGA maps.,70,18
Software,B00004Z0C8,2,negative,"I just purchased this software with a Garmin eTrac Legend.  I drove to the Seacoast down many major highways that were not on the map even though they are 10 to 15 years old.  On my Garmin, I am always north of the features on the map, I don't know if this is a map error or a GPS error.  The Mapsource software on the cd is old by several versions.  The new software is free online.  You do get what you pay for, this software is not expensive, but it is not very good on detail either.",98,19
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,Probably Mapsource deserves a higher rating but I have only used it Deer Hunting in Eastern Oregon so far.  It was easy to load and added a lot of detail even in a very rural area with only forest service roads.  The contours helped me to keep from falling into a ravine and being forced into a direction that I did not want to go.  I can't wait to load more of the map and some different areas.  I like the fact that you only have to load what you will be using.  It did not take as much memory as I expected it would.  I wouldn't use a GPS without it again.,113,20

Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"I bought this software to help navigate the logging roads and mountain biking trails in North Kitsap county (Washington State). What trails are shown are largely accurate, but not perfect. Some logging roads show a dead-end where it actually continues. Still, though, it's WAY better than nothing and impressive topo data.",51,22
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"Pros:  1. Memory requirements are no problem.  The 64mb card can easily swallow several states worth of maps.

2. If you don't mind not having street names depicted, this software can easily allow you to course navigate with the plethora of street detail included.

3. Contour and waterway detail is spot-on.

4. Overall, I was impressed with the logging roads and trails depicted for the state of Maine.  They matched my Delorme paper maps contour-for-contour.

Cons: 1. You can't input two waypoints and get turn-by-turn navigation guidance for highway travel (a la mapquest). Rather, you have to manually enter waypoints for every ""bend"" in your journey...and this goes for PC set-up.

2. If you want your track to remain ""right on the depicted road"" while traveling on highways, you must stay in a higher scale 'cuz when you zoom in, you almost inevitably end up a millimeter or two ""off course"" on your screen.

Software,B00004Z0C8,1,negative,"Very imprecise, poor and obsolete software. Lack of trails, roads etc.. , could be even danger in the remote area to person who trust it. You will have some use but rather with  good paper topographic map.",37,25
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"If you understand this product's limits before you buy it, you'll be happy.  It shows topographical contours, rivers and most streams for the entire United States.  In addition to that, it shows roads that were in existance 10-20 years ago.  These major roads are also named.

The limit is that newer roads don't show up.  It also doesn't support auto-routing, even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn't suited for it.

The product support could be better.  Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you don't have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones.  The company's web site doesn't give a good explanation of what the software can and can't do.

You'll be disappointed if your expectations aren't grounded in reality.  Garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available.",169,26

One nit-pick, although it's not Garmin's fault; the 1:100,000 scale USGS maps are in metric so, Garmin converted the meter contours to feet which means that even contours like 1000 meters is shown as 3280 feet. At least, you don't have to deal with elevations in meters, though.",97,28

I honestly can't reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography. Garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain USA parks.

I would think that if Garmin was going to force us to by their maps, they would make an effort to improve them!  I would say that anyone with a Garmin who is going to use it for 4WD roads and hiking trails should buy another mapping program to get waypoints.",91,34

Software,B00004Z0C8,5,positive,"I wasn't sure what I was getting when I purchased this TOPO Package, but am very pleased. It is a great addition to the tools that GeoCachers use with plenty of detail. I was also surprised that many of the better known trails (especially in state and national parks) are marked on the maps. However, it's easy to get spoiled by that and I find myself wishing more of the trails were marked.

I still feel that this software will exceed most people's expectations. My state of Virginia takes up about 36MB of storage on my GPS, so to store a whole lot you'll need a GPS with a lot of room. I loaded mine with just the areas I frequent the most, and any planned GeoCaching areas as the need arises.

Also, if you know you're traveling to an area, you can print the topo map and put it in a zip lock bag for a map to go.",160,39

My one nit is the installation instructions should indicate to install all cd's on your hard drive then actually perform the installation.  By doing this eliminates the need to insert a CD everytime you want to pull up a chart.",89,42
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"It wasn't easy, but I finally got my US Topo software installed so I don't have to mess with the CD's.  Garmin needs to get on the ball and make this the standard install.  Basically, you need to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all the files from disk one into this folder.  Using the ""Copy"" command from the drop down menu won't work, so you have to work around this issue. On the second and third CD, you will create subdirectories in the folder you created called ""East"", ""Alaska"", and ""Hawaii"". Once done (it will take a while), do the setup command from the folder you created on your hard drive.

I had called Customer Support for a little assistance with this issue and after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I discovered that the Customer support at Garmin SUCKS! I love the GPS, I love the software, but the customer support is a total waste of time.

If you don't need the terrain detail of the 24K series, give USA Topo a try first.

The one thing I am disappointed with is the program's insistence of having the CD in the drive to work.  This is quite annoying.  MapSource City Select and USA Topo 24K both allow you to install all the map files to your heard drive.  USA Topo should too.",129,47

This is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your Garmin unit, other software claims to work with your Garmin GPS, but they only download/upload waypoints. This software is way overpriced; it runs off the CD-ROM so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps. I tried copying the CD's to my drive and installing from there and it would not work. When pulling waypoints/routes/tracks from the GPS unit Mapsource always opens up a new map document, you can't import into the map you have open without copying and pasting. This is probably the most overpriced, counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since MS Office. What this all boils down to is if you need detailed TOPO maps for your Garmin unit you'll have to shell out the cash and put up with slow unfriendly software.",158,52
Software,B00004Z0C8,4,positive,"This product is what it is. It isn't a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it. It is a basic set of TOPO maps that shows most local roads. What do you want for under $100 for a set of maps that covers the entire USA? It doesn't have every street name, the water maps are a little sparce, and some of the feature names are dated. I bought, I like it, I use it for what it is good for.

Bottom line is that this is a tool like any other. You wouldn't build a car engine with nothing but a $5 pair of pliers but you could. You can mow your entire lawn with a $29 string trimer but you wouldn't. This is a basic $100 set of maps of the entire united states, for the price you can't beat the detail.

If I had it to do over again I would still buy TOPO USA because it works for me.",169,53

The told me I need to use TOPO USA... I loaded the program, but it needed the CD, I found out in here how can I install so never ask for the CD. This is nasty! The trail detail is that it will give you a point! I hope at least the trail is crossing it! I am used to the usual line to mark the way of the trail and not a point (Maybe its a vertical trail straight up?) I hate the map, I still like the GPS.

Going from having only the major roads to having all land marks(streams, small lakes, elevation lines) really adds to the GPS.  The amount of detail can be adjusted to your preference.

The only problem is the TOPO maps don't allow auto-routing by the V, to calculate routes around trails, etc.  So it's back to standard GPS map navigation.
But one use I've found is this...some points of interest are not in the GPS V base map, nor are they in the V's City Select software.  So I simultaneously load the TOPO software, and presto, I can pick out the TOPO's points of interest...set a waypoint up...then route to it via the City Select map.
It works fine, that is unless you're finding a place which doens't have a road, but for driving to trail heads, and other TOPO type features, it's helped me.
But it loses a star since I can't route directly on the TOPO maps on my V.",137,59

It worked as well on the GPS as it did on my PC, and again I have no hesitation in recommending it.
Perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with United States Geological Survey topographical maps or other navigation aids, so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed.

Most roads are there but they just vanish at some points and reappear in others. Using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should. The elevations and detail are very course. No trails are shown. I am not very happy I bought this product and am going to look into the roads and recreation to see if it does a better job. FYI I bought this to use with my Etrex Legend which I think is just great.,128,65

Purchasing Garmin software used is a pointless exercise in disappointment.  If you're going to buy them, you need to buy them new.

In four, you can create JPEGS as well as PDF's of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive. It took me all of a half hour before I had my first page done. Showing people the ropes of the software (I gave version four as a Christmas gift to a few people) took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own.

You can get a copy of four for about 20.00 more than this version and I feel it it well worth it. Many pages I have done, people think were done with 400.00 photoshop.

Software,B00005NZXQ,2,negative,"What a disappointment considering modern day programs.  This one is primative.  It reminds me of apps 15 years ago.  It's complicated yet limited in what it can do.  I have been trying for 3 hours to add a page for a digital scrapbook and once the program labels a page as ""front"" it cannot be done.  I've clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest.  No luck. (Even the tutorial is non-interactive). Additionally, pages cannot be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste.  Further, each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects.  The help section is also very basic.

One good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job.  Additionally, no problem running this w/ Windows 7.

Have not used any other scrapbook programs, but I sure wouldn't recommend this one.",156,9

I haven't had any text come out with clear edges and anytime you change the size of any graphic it will pixilize the edges.  I do have a good printer and can print perfect pictures so long as I don't use this program.  Another thing I found extremely frustrating was not being able to search for a type of graphic.  If you want a heart or scissors or flowers you have to search through everything to find them.

I had trouble getting the first page I created to print in 12 x 12 size on a 12 x 12 sheet of paper.  However, I called tech support.  The first rep didn't help much, but then I got a follow-up call from Derek, who had gone to the trouble of downloading my Canon S9000 printer's driver!  Together, we got the print function going and produced a perfect page.  It's really refreshing to find a software outfit that really cares about the results its customers are getting!  It is too bad that the templates supplied with this program are so cutesy and schmaltzy, and that more background ""paper"" isn't supplied.  But if you start with a blank template, hey, it's a clean slate and you can let your imagination run wild.

I live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in Street Atlas 2004 it still didn't have my neighborhood in it and I live near a major city.

I can't recommend this software for other than very basic information.  You can get a paper map that will work better.",125,0

On my P2/250 laptop it runs slowly, but not nearly as slow as the 2004 version did. I just purchased a GPS device for it and love how it integrates with it. I travel extensively in my job and having the GPS feature makes finding where I'm going very easy.

There are some inaccuracies with the POI's as others have stated, but they aren't so far off that you couldn't find them with a little looking around. At least with them marked on the maps you get a very good idea where they are.

Web based maps are good to have, but when you have to travel to several locations in a day its impossible for me to get online to find where I'm going. With this in my vehicle I can get where I'm going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks.

Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,After using Street Atlas 2005 for one trip I find it was worth making the upgrade.  One new feature is that it shows the next turn and the turn after that in the Show Turns window. It also gives this information in the voice navigation.  This will eliminate a number of instances where I have used the voice commands to obtain this information.  The number of trail points is now settable which can clear the map and reduce the load on the computer.  There is a new version of the Microsoft speech recognition software. The file system has been simplified with the option to return to the full system if desired via a patch available free from DeLorme.  The program loads much quicker.  I recommend buying Street Atlas 2005.,129,2

It's been a nightmare trying to get it to work.

Others have had this same problem, as related on the Delorme forum, so it isn't just my computer, or my installation technique. Every other Delorme product I have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem.

I have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply (after five days). On their forum I was told to follow the instructions for a so-called ""clean install,"" but when I followed them (three times!) I got the same result.

I'm sending this obviously inadequately tested and bug-filled software back for a refund.",159,3
Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,"Delorme's product is dynamic. It works out-of-the-box as a GPS navigation companion.  It will automatically start talking to you and guiding you from where you are, and take you toward your destination.  If you get off-track, it re-routes you automatically within seconds.

Microsoft's product is static, or ""dead"".  Connected to a GPS, it will show you where you are... but don't expect it to think ahead.  I've used it numerous times and it had been helpful because its an accurate MAP and shows where you are, but that's it. There is a lot more to giving someone good directions than just saying ""This is where you are"". You want to know when to get ready to turn up ahead, so you can prepare for it. Delorme's software will do that for you and do it very well.",137,4
Software,B0002IP3KM,1,negative,"Problems in many areas:

- Buggy installation: I had to re-install after a squeeky clean reboot (on XP; had to use msconfig to boot with no other drivers).  The software still has trouble locating well-established addresses and significant landmarks.

- Weak ""find"" function.  Cannot identify addresses with any intelligence.

- User interface is not intuitive at all; ambiguous commands, poor screen/button layout.

I'm trying to be patient and tough it out, but frankly I would not buy it knowing what I know now.  I also have Msft Streets & Trips, and although it has limitations as a navigation tool, the U/I is much easier to use, no problems with installation, and the data is far more complete.",117,5

Software,B0002IP3KM,4,positive,"I have a long commute and wanted to figure out which back roads were ideal.

I was deciding between Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2005 and this program.  I think the deciding factor was that the Delorme software has the ability for me to manually choose other roads besides the roads the program recommends.

Microsoft's version doesn't seem to offer this.  At least they don't mention it.  By allowing me to choose my own roads, I can avoid rush hour roads that are not ideal even though they are the calculated ones.

It may not have as many POIs, but I was more interested in customizing and alterning suggested routes than points of interest.  That feature alone made the Delorme worth it for me.",123,7

This is not due to the GPS receiver. The receiver gives the right coordinate data. If you plot that data by hand on the map you will be positioned wrong. This indicates that the maps are not calibrated right.

Tech support was worthless. All they tell you is that you can return it before 30 days. Of course, you're still out the tax and the cost of sending it back.

Do not buy this product until they have fixed the maps. Consider yourself warned.",124,9

So I went out and got Street Atlas, which happened to be the first piece of navigation software I found.  That was version 2004.  I've been hooked ever since.  I used to get lost in downtown Buffalo all the time, now I don't get lost anymore.  I loved 2004 so much I got 2005 and it is a big improvement.  The user interface is much easier than in 2004 (and in 2004 it was EASY, and I mean super-EASY).  You can install the entire continental United States and fit it comfortably on your hard drive and map out a trip from one end of the country to the other and get there without getting lost.  For those techie people like me who get lost all the time, this program is like a godsend.  You can even print out directions on your desktop and e-mail them, give them to friends, so on and so forth without a GPS receiver!",189,10
Software,B0002IP3KM,5,positive,"I've used Delorme Street Atlas since GPS receivers were novel and cost hundreds of dollars. I have liked every version they have put out and 2005 is no exception. The reason I bought the 2005 version even though it is now 2009 is because it installs and runs easily in through Wine in linux (including USB/serial GPS  support!).

Newer versions (tested up to 2008 as of this review) do not install and/or run well via Wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored, street-level navigation in linux.

If you want updated cartography and new, handy features, go with a newer version. All versions of Delorme Street Atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag. However, if you want a street-level nav program for linux that doesn't require internet access and uses vector rather than raster maps, Delorme Street Atlas 2005 is your best bet.",157,11

Software,B0002IP3KM,2,negative,"Street Atlas 2004 has a problem that if the version of Windows is not English or if the user sets languages other than English as their default language set on US version of Windows, SA 2004 does not work at all.  So, I have to change the language setting of my US version of Windows XP and reboot the computer every time that I need to run SA 2005.  It was so cumbersome and I wished that this problem is fixed in SA 2005.  However, SA 2005 has the same problem and it seems like DeLorme does not care about this problem at all.

If you are a user who uses different language setting on Windows, you should try Microsoft Streets & Trips instead of SA 2005.  SA 2005 has better GPS capability than MS S & T, however, my choice is S & T for this reason.

Software,B0002IP3KM,1,negative,"I bought this software and found that it could only work when Win XP's regional setting set to U.S.A. English. Since I had to have another regional setting because of my job, the software was no use.

Another thing is that there is misinformation on the product's box: it claims that Delorme includes major roads and highways in Canada, while its competitors don't. The fact is that while Delorme only covers major Canadian roads, Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2005 can generate detailed maps of Canadian streets just as what it can do about U.S. addresses. Microsoft's product can produce driving directions in Canada too, which Delorme cannot do.

2. Some map informations are egregiously out of date.
A road removed by freeway construction a decade ago still appears on the map, and i was asked to go through it.
3. It doesn't locate my location precisely with GPS.
It claimed that i was driving on a freeway when i was actually on a local road next to the freeway.

He has worn them for a eleven months now, which for him is amazing.  The leather is still in good condition, the nylon has held and there isn't a single stitch that has been worn out by constant use.  However, I'm a bit disappointed with the soles because they have worn quickly when compared with other brands.  I myself have been wearing the same pair of Wellco Jungle boots for 3 years every day and the soles of mine, though worn do not look anything like his.  His literally have gouges missing on the heel and the toe is almost worn smooth.  Still for an active child whose hard on shoes, when considering the price I've got to give 5 stars.",185,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,5,positive,I am pleased with the seller and the boots. I received them early via UPS. The other reviews are correct you should order them one size smaller than you normally wear. I did not and am having to return them. When I contacted the seller they replied promptly and with courtesy. I will be buying other merchandise from this seller in the future. The boots did look like they would need insoles. However all military boots I have owned for work needed extra insoles to be comfortable for 12+ hour shifts.,91,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,"If you need a sturdy, combat ready pair of speed-lace boots, these boots are an unbeatable value.

They take a pretty good shine too.",56,7

They hold up great and overall excellent performance 10/5 for these boots. And for all of those people who are a little overweight let me say, I weigh 350 pounds and beat my mile run by  10 minutes simply from having comfortable boots, 20-23 minutes last year in work boots, 10-13 minutes in these very good, excellent way to help loose weight fast if you like the outdoors like me- ;)

P.S- they are the same as ACU (Tan combat boots) boots only black.",116,8

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,"They suck. they lasted one month of rather sedentary kitchen work and walking home, before the insole was starting to wear through, showing my sock! I had other Panama lug soles that my father had from the army in the 70s and 80s that lasted me five years of daily wear.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,"Not the best made boot, not the worst made boot.  A good value.  Value being ""what you get for the price paid"".

They are comfy.  With a bit of break in, they get very soft, and really don't offer much protection against rough and tumble environments, but.... they are a pleasure to walk in, fairly light, give fairly good wear (ie, they last ok).

I've had boots that were top shelf, costing several times the price of the Rothco boots.  They lasted longer.  They were a bit tougher.  No lighter as I recall.  I can't say the top of the line boots were as good a value.

I'm rather rough on my footwear, doing outdoor/jobsite work most of the time.  I can use these, not worry about my ""expensive"" boots, and they pretty much take the abuse until the soles wear thin.

I'll re-order when I need another set, no problem.",151,21

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,4,positive,"This boot arrived quickly and in good condition. It is a good looking boot but was too big for my son, who wears a size 8. The treads look sturdy. The only thing I wasn't excited about was the lacing system. It appears that there are hook/loop type lacing abover the regular laces, however they are closed hooks, so they also have to be threaded through holes. But some people could see this as a plus, I guess, as they loosen quickly for easy removal and then don't have to be rehooked, just tightened.",94,33

Thankfully my son has a second pair, and I have a pair of Force entry's as these will not last the month.",79,37
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,"The boots are labled as size 10, but the are over an inch longer than another pair of Rothco jungle boots I own and look huge.  My feet are swimming in these boots.  If these are size 10 I am a monkey's uncle.  They look like they are probably 12+.  Now I have to deal with trying to send them back and get my money back.  I cannot even image what ""size"" would be an actually size 10.

Now that I have sent the boots back and spent another $11.30 the company is not giving me a full refund nor paying my shipping costs.  The company is defrauding me out of 25% of the original cost plus shipping.  Beware of buying from this company!

Update:  Amazon did the right thing and refunded me the shipping costs.  I do not think it came from the shipping company, but from Amazon.  Nice move Amazon!",152,38
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,2,negative,"These boots don't come in half-sizes so they were too big for me, and they've already developed massive cracks on the toe area after only a few weeks of use.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000E246MC,1,negative,"Price was good, construction was not. I wore these boots for less than 12 hours total before the heel on the toe started to peel.

Much superior to any other 'banded hearing protector' on the current market [forget those bogus 'foam-plug' jokes that need replacing every other day]. These are light-weight, easy to wear around the neck when not in use, so always handy, a bonus. The 'ear-plugs' are very comfortable and easy to insert and later clean.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,"I bought these because the ear plug material is smooth and easy to clean.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,I had them at the range today for the first time.  After about 30 min. my ear hurt a little.  I reached up to my ear and found that the red end part had come off in my ear and the metal part was in my ear and could have been dangerous.,52,13

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,I was very disappointed in the Radians Red Banded hearing protections.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,The gel plugs on these do not fit well in my ears and after having jammed them in hard enough to block sound they do not provide enough attenuation to suit my needs. They also work loose and then I loose all attenuation. It may be just my ear shape but I suspect the material they are made from transmits too much sound.,63,25

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,This is the best hearing protection I've had. I've never cared for the ear muff type protectors. Being banded keeps you from loosing them.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,5,positive,"These earplugs offer excellent hearing protection while working construction. The biggest benefit is that they easily clip around your neck when you are not wearing them, making it easy to pop them in your ears just before you grab for the saw or the nail gun. Construction equipment is loud and running it without hearing protection damages your hearing. And let's face it, unless it takes about one second to locate and put on your hearing protection, it's not going to happen. Some of the other reviewers mentioned durability. I had a pair for a year before they broke, and just bought two replacement pairs. They are a few bucks and easy to replace. Also the gel ear inserts are comfortable and easy to clean. Highly recommended product.",128,34
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,2,negative,"The plastic band cannot be adjusted, and the pressure forces the ear plugs deep into your ear canal.  I can only wear these for about 30 minutes then I have to pull them out, and I can only wear them for about an hour a day.  They do seal tightly and block noise.

I got these for yard mowing because my outside-the-ear ""earmuff"" hearing protectors became hot and wet with sweat.  I have an older pair of ear plug protectors that have an adjustable stainless steel band and a blunt type of oil filled ear plug, and they are more comfortable.  It would help if a blunt type of ear plug was offered.

These would be good for short time noise exposure.  The most comfortable hearing protection I have found are the cheap foam ear plugs that you compress by rolling between your fingers and then press into your ear canal.",151,35
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000F7P25G,1,negative,"I don't know if it's because I have a large head or not, but this was not comfortable at all. The problem was not the material that goes into your ears, it was that there was way too much pressure applied through the band.",44,36

I really hope I can figure these things out, because I don't like clutter, and I like things to look neat.  The only way I am able to figure out how to use these things right now, I could just do that with some spare line I have and save the money, but I want to be able to attach these like it shows in the photo.

Slightly trailing point for good game preparation and piercing qualities.  A medium hollow grind for good cutting and slicing qualities.  A riveted, larger handle for a big hand, and made of durable hardwood or laminated resin.  A good quality nylon or leather sheath.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2,negative,"This item is best described as a knife-shaped object. It came quite dull, and the steel is too soft to take a decent edge. I wouldn't try to cut anything with it; a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. That said, it suited my purposes as a stage prop very well, and was about what I expected given the price.

The main reason I'm deducting stars is because, contrary to the item description, no sheath was included with the knife I received. All I got was a small plastic cap for the point.

In summary, this is a good option if you want something that looks like a knife but won't be used to cut anything. If you want to actually cut things you should get something of better quality.",133,27

Luckily I have enough leather working craft to fix them, but still. On at least three of the knives, the pommel is loose and will turn almost 3/4 turn to tighten, but won't go a full turn, so these knives have loose handles/blades and feel sloppy/wobbly.

The blade is misaligned with the guard. The leather (?) sheath is thin as paper and the stitching was do loose you can see an 1/8 inch gap. Overall, it was a complete waste of money.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,"I love the design of this lighter. It's built solid enough to use as a weapon, holds lots of butane and points an LED light at whatever you're trying to light at night - perfect for campfires. The dual flame type for wind resistance also burns the fuel more efficiently so it doesn't leave black smudges on glass or metal surfaces. It would be a great lighter IF it worked!! #1 worked for about a week before the LED light quit working, the switch stopped ""clicking"". I didn't send it back for repair, instead I cut back the rubber to jam the safety button to make it light easier, then ordered a new one. #2 arrived empty and 4 attempts to fill it failed with a hissing sound at the refill valve. This one I sent back to Zippo for warranty repair. #3 arrived today - they sent me a brand new one - but the LED switch doesn't click at all so the light doesn't work. I'm right back where I started!! 3 out of 3 have been defective. Disgraceful for a company like Zippo - especially at $32.00 retail!",191,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,"Got one for Christmas.. works well, though it does require a little effort to hit the 2 buttons in sequence to get it lit.  I got it down but my wife hates that part, which probably makes it child and accident-proof.

The instructions mention that this is a windproof lighter.. at least if you keep blowing it out it will relight.  That doesn't mean it will stay lit in high winds, but it will relight when the wind dies down as long as you are still holding the buttons.

The windproof-effect has something to do with 2 flame outlets.. the main orifice has a small glowing grille, next to it is a tiny hole where another flame comes out.  The flame itself is not a jet but like that of a candle.

The built-in LED light works OK and the button for that is easy to operate.  The black rubber handle only seems to add bulk, but it won't slip out of your hands.  The carabiner clip is probably useful.

It is a wonderful gadget to have around the house for lighting candles and citronella torches on the deck. The tiny light is great for outdoor lighting in the dark.,51,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,"My male relatives have everything and, consequently, are difficult to buy for. I found this lighter quite by accident and am glad I did. My brother is hard to impress but this did the trick. He immediately took it camping and was very pleased with its performance. I followed up by purchasing three more for other members of the family. I'm next!",62,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,FOR 34.00 BUCKS I EXPECTED A TOURCH. I GET A STRONGER AND LONGER FLAME FROM A 5.00 THROW AWAY LIGHTER YOU GET AT THE HARDWARE STORE. APPARENTLY I CAN'T RETURN THEM SO I GOT STUCK WITH 2 OF THEM. I WOULD NEVER BUY FROM affordable luxury,46,4
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,"Unit came very quickly, works perfectly out of the package. Is a little larger than I expected, better for lighting propane appliances and wood fires. Seems like it will be easy to refill",33,5
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,Purchased from Amazon and it worked OK for about 6 weeks. Followed filling instructions and use instructions. Zippo warranties it but you must pay shipping and send $10. Do the math. I stick with throw away BBQ lighters now.,39,6
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,5,positive,"Although I sympathize with the button-safety haters, fixing the problem took all of five minutes, and I listened to Mozart so it was quite pleasant.  (Complain all you want, but it's better to do something, is my philosophy whenever I'm complaining about something.)

The reason I'm bestowing Five Stars on this tool is the combination of quality and price.  I'm biased toward Zippos anyway, because they're simple and they work 99.9% of the time.  Most things in life work 75% of the time, and not always that.

For what I paid in plastic refillables with triggers in the winter of 1999, I could have bought two of these.  So I'm going to buy another now, and another one yet for a gift.  BUY THIS TOOL, leave the safety alone if you have little kids, fix it if you don't (with a tiny Phillips screwdriver) and it will last for years.",150,7

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,"I should have read the reviews.
I bought this thing thinking it  would be a really useful addition to my emergency kit.
I can't figure out how to make it light!
You have to destroy the package to get it open and cut through the instructions in the process
Instructions are cleverly hidden on the inside of the cardboard cover.
The fine print says it won't work at altitudes over 5,000 feet.
I live at 8,000 ft.
I can't see in the ""fuel gauge"" whether it has any fuel or not.
I would be sending it back except it says you can't do that...",104,9
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,The product is okay.  It is pictured with having an attached cover/top.  However it did not come with one. Perhaps that is why it was considerabley less expensive. I find that very misleading and I would not buy from that vendor again.,42,10

The flame goes out easily at other times. Probably would work indoors, but matches or a inexpensive candle lighter would work just as well.",57,11
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,"I was looking for a gas burner lighter for my camp stove.  Most that you buy are disposable and I hate throwing things away.  Comes with a nice key ring for hanging it up.  The drawbacks are 1.  The fuel level window is so small, and doesn't go through to the other side of the lighter so I can't see the level, and 2.  You have to push two buttons at once (child proofing) to turn on the flame.  They are quit stiff because they are covered with a rubber shield and hard to depress together.  They recommend that Zippo fuel only be used so I bought a can at the same time.",113,12
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4,positive,This is a great lighter for camping or around the house.  It has a good design for an all purpose lighter.  One thing that really was a pain was the paper warning sticker that they placed over one of the fuel windows.  This is one of those stickers that tears into a thousand little pieces when you try to remove it.  Have they heard of removable plastic stickers or removable glue like on post-it notes?,75,13
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2,negative,Has good design. But Flame is weak and easy to blow out. Ignition switches are very difficult to press.,19,14

I had the same problem, it takes about 3 attempts to get this going. If you try hard enough you can probably can it going on the first attempt but good luck.  They way over do it with the safety feature its so good that nobody can get it working. Wish they would just do away with the safety button.  Bottom line is that it looks cool but when I reach into the drawer to get the BBQ going. I get my $4 Bic to get the fire going.",104,16
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,"I was very excited to get this product because I am tired of the cheap $5 lighters that you get from the supermarket. However, when I got this I was horrified by the performance. The first thing I noticed when I tried to light it is that the flame is pitiful. It barely comes out the end (yes I adjusted the knob at the bottom all the way up). The flame is also very easy to blow out. I was trying to show my kids that it would relight, so I let them blow on it, but it would go out with even the smallest puff (from my 2 year old) and it would never come back.

The LED light also takes stupid watch batteries so beware of that.

I am very disappointed and I am going to be sending this back as soon as possible.",146,17
Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,"This lighter is certainly child-proof. In fact, it is so hard to ignite that you will likely need two hands and a couple of attempts.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1,negative,"This lighter was essentially dead on arrival.  I read all instructions before attempting to use it.  After a dozen or so futile attempts to get it to light, I read the instructions again.  I topped it off with butane, set the flame adjust to maximum, and double checked that the batteries were installed properly.  Still nothing.  After many more frustrated attempts to engage the very difficult to use safety and ignition buttons at the same time, it finally produced a flame about an 1/8th of an inch high.  Wind resistant?  A baby could blow out this flame.  By the way, it is not actually manufactured by Zippo in Bradford Pennsylvania.  According to the package, this item is ""manufactured in China to Zippo Quality standards.""  Zippo should be ashamed of itself.  This is an expensive piece of junk with their name on it.",142,19
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,5,positive,"Seeing all the negative reviews, I was a little scared to buy this, but I figured I would give it a try at this price. I don't know what the other reviewers' experiences were, but my case came in one piece nicely packed in a box with multiple inflatable packaging around it. The frame itself is great and just the right size for displaying a comic book I recently had signed. It's made of very sturdy plastic. I think I would have to work at it to break the front. The back is a piece of black plastic that doesn't seem as strong and is probably the part that the other reviewers were claiming broke. I can see how that could happen with neglect, but it's definitely strong and sturdy enough to hang on the wall.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0013JI5HW,2,negative,The part that allows you to hang it on the wall is poorly designed and broke the first time I mounted it on the wall.  Plastic is high quality as the fall from 6 foot didn't cause any further damage.,40,1

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,"i bought this tent at an army surplus store for a big game hunt. have yet to use it for that but ive spent numerous nights in it outside. i'll admitt its a little tricky to use right out of the package but once aquainted with set up its bliss to sleep in. keeps rain, bugs, and uneven cold ground out of the equation. you'll need extra rope for the main supports, string for the canopy support, and youll have to store all but the smaller gear underneath the hammok. also a pillow, not for your neck but for under your knees, the curve of the hammok stresses them a little. hope this helps.",114,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,"OK. This hammock does require extra rope to even set up.  It may seem ungainly at first, but if you are patient with it you will be rewarded.  I reccomend using a very sturdy rope to set up the wight bearing portion of the hammock.  I just use fishing line (a spool of it would seem useful in a backpacking situation anyways)to hold up the netting and top tarp.  It is sort of scary to get into, but if set up properly, and entered with care, is actually pretty comfortable inside.  I think it's great for backpacking or camping where you need to be off the ground. very light and takes very little space.  Be smart and you'll have no problems.  (BTW, I weigh about 220 lbs. and have no problems with it.",133,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,"We bought this hammock in March 2010, and did not even take it out of the box and use it until August. I would give it ""0"" stars if I could. After one use, the seams of the straps that attach to the ropes began to pull apart from the body of the hammock, making for a very dangerous situation if someone were not to inspect and notice it before climbing in. The one person who used it that one time was far under the weight limit the manufacturer rates the hammock, so that was not the issue.

This is an extremely dangerous product. Granted, for the price, you don't expect the quality to match the best on the market. However, that's entirely not the issue. At any price, you have the right to expect safety if used within the guidelines the manufacturer sets for the product. If someone were to climb in and the straps were to snap, a major back or other injury could result. I notified Amazon, and they stated they have had complaints about this item. I guess not everyone takes the time to write a review. I can only hope they remove it from their inventory.",201,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1,negative,"I bought this ""hammock"" for local hiking trips and maybe an overnighter. Like the other person stated, it is a pain in the neck to set up. Yes you will need extra line to set it up and it is not wide enough. This thing is better suited to be set up as a ground based mosquito proof shelter. Why would you do that? If that's the case then just buy a net and save on time, money and the added extra weight of this junk. I do not reccomend this cheap alternative to buying something better like a hennessy or other quality name brand hammock.",106,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,"Pros:
-Not much
-It's cheap and has a mosquito net attached.
-Zippers, seams and stress points are relativley sturdy (though I've only used it twice so far)
-Less bulky than carrying a sleeping pad and tent

Cons:
-There are no directions on how to set this hammock up.  Normally it would seem like a no brainer as most hammocks come out of the box with the suspension ropes intertwined/braided into the actual hammock but this hammock doesn't. You get the hammock (the canvas,net,nylon) and seperatley the rope and metal rings.
-You need an additional 30 feet of rope to suspend the mosquito net and nylon roofing
-No way is this rain worthy as is, you need to get an additional tarp plus ANOTHER 20+ feet of rope
-Heavy, especially with all the additonal rope and tarping.
-Pretty narrow on the inside, especially with the net zipped up and inside a sleeping bag",152,4

Do you know why there are signs before bridges that say, ""bridge freezes before road'?  Well that is because there is cold air going over AND under the bridge, thereby making the bridge colder.  Same thing happens while sleeping in a hammock, it's COLD.  Furthermore, if you move in your sleep (and I mean at all), you will wake up constantly trying to reposition yourself.  One time I woke up, and the entire hammock had shifted to where I was laying on the mosquito net portion of the hammock.  Overall, very cheap fabric, and just not a practical solution to camping in the woods.",134,17

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,"For the price, I would recommend this. You need a little patience and common sense to use it, but it does work well. TIP - when you string it up, put all the weight/tension on the bottom ropes. Put hardly any weight/load on the mosquito netting because the straps will break and the hammock will suddenly drop until the main ropes pick up the load.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,5,positive,"Awesome tent. A lot of people complained about not being able to close the zipper once you get inside...You need to hang the netting using 1/8"" bungee cord NOT ROPE. this allows the tent netting and canopy to FLEX. The only issue I had with this is that we camped at 11000 feet during a really cold and Rainy week. I brought a small tarp with me to cover the hammock that kept me dry but when the wind blew it got COLD specially underneath it. The answer to the problem was to use an EMERGENCY BLANKET to keep the wind from penetrating my sleeping bag. The other issue was finding 4 trees spaced right to hang it. Tried using 2 connections and the hammock was not as stable. Once I connected it at 4 points it worked awesome!!",139,25

The bag that it came with ripped on the first use - and I was intentionally trying to take it easy on it.

The ropes that tie together on it seemed a bit iffy - some fraying going on.

I am not quite sure what the material actually is which supports the ends of the hammock.  However, I am sure that this product would not stand up to even the most modest load.

Unfortunately, I'll be returning this product as soon as possible.",112,53

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2,negative,"This hammock looks great from the outside, however, its very cheaply made. when I set up the tent it was hard to get the right height and was very uncomfortable to get into.

Pros: its cheap for what it is
its easy to carry around
has a decent mosquito net

Cons: does no tome with rainfly shown in some of the pictures.
The side netting tore little
they do not come with ropes to set it up and the entire thing is just uncomfortable.
its extremely narrow on the inside
its not fully water proof

overall i would recommend steering away from this hammock and spend the money on a bigger better hammock",113,57

I'd get another one. as far as walkin in the deep woods and needing a place to take a nap, there is no better way than off the ground in a mosquito net. I saw a review saying it was cheep- He was not honest. I know cheep and hate it.
I will say there is not the canvas that is in the picture and no extra rope to tie it to a tree, it also says there is no directions, if you cant figure how to tie a not to a tree, stay at home.
But It looks like its well worth buying.",130,59

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4,positive,"As long as your under 6 foot and 250 pounds, this Mosquito Hammock is fine when used with a rainfly over the top.
Yes, it takes a few hangs before you get it right. Remember to tie it up high but straight across.
Use the roof only to block sun. A rainfly is needed as with all the topend hammocks out there. it's a must have.
You have a canvas bottom, which means less chance of a mosquito bite from below. as compared to a nylon Hammock, a bit heavier but still packable.
Not very wide, but for the normal size person you can lay flat or on your side with no problems.
A pad and a sleeping bag makes this a winner. works pretty good on the ground as well with  cot or bottom cloth.
It does everything the big boy hammocks do at a MUCH cheaper price.
ofcourse you can't brag you spent $300.00 on your hammock..but do you really want to? :)

The diameter of the hooks is only about 1 1/2 icnhes wide. No shotgun or any AR or Carbine style rifle will fit, only my Rem. 700 would fit but the scope rubbed on the roof and it wouldnt fit in the bottom so it was out of the question as well. Only a pellet gun. Also the bottom hooks are so close to the top hooks that not even a pellet gun will fit inside. I only recommend if you wanted to spend a solid hour Dremel in hand as I did increasing the diameter and cutting an inch of the bottom hooks.

I know that an M1A is a bit bigger of a rifle than most (a man's gun, if you will), but these hooks were a solid 3/4"" too narrow.

I might also just not worry about it and just mount these in the workshop to keep the guns I'm working on off of the desk.

This large-jaw basin wrench solves the problem, nicely.  More typical basin wrenches will work up to about 1 1/2"", after that you've got to improvise.

The extended upper jaw on this unit allows you to work with nuts up to 3"" in width, which covers the majority of 1 1/2"" to 2"" sanitary pipe fittings.

I should have done that in the beginning.

The 1 3/8"" nut  I used it on seemed to be at the small end of it's grip (don't get this tool INSTEAD OF a regular jaw size basin wrench).

It just took a bit of work to figure out which side of the screen to place them (opposite the side where the spline is located) and you need to work it a bit as it does make inserting the spline a tighter fit.  I used a 0.140 spline with a standard screen.  The tabs make the insertion and removal of the screen much easier and so far they held very securely.

I tried every type of shampoo and conditioner, tried rinsing my hair in rainwater I collected in a barrel (that worked a bit though it can be quite a shock in the winter), and concocted a vinegar rinse. Finally, I purchased the Crystal Quest with its super-duper filter. Not only is my hair soft and manageable again, but my skin feels much better, too. It was easy to install and works great.

It also has an off switch on the shower head which helps when your trying to lather your dog without turning the water competely off. The only disadvantage is changing the direction of the filter every couple of weeks. I would like to have a shower head filter that I can install and leave.

It keeps breaking because its made of cheap plastic (a type of styrene, which is toxic btw!).  After 1 year they would not send me replacement parts, so now I am stuck with a broken showerhead that I can either keep buying parts for from crystal quest or I can find another showerhead that doesnt break all the time.  Anyone have any showerhead filter recommendations?  I am so dissapointed in this showerhead, such a waste of money, and its been a hassel having to write to crystal quest every 5 or so months it seems to get something replaced.  Not at all environmentally friendly either!  I don't know why they cant just make it of metal, I would certainly buy it if it was metal- it wouldnt be breaking all the time, and wouldnt have the plastic/styrene concern either!  Didnt like the customer service from crystal quest either....",172,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KKXPZC,4,positive,"I live in Chicago, where the city water is hard. I purchased this showerhead with some reservations because of the previous reviews. So, far, I am very pleased with the product. The showerhead does give you increased water pressure, resulting in a more powerful and cleaner shower experience. LESS RESIDUE!! My skin, scalp and hair is less dryer than before! The installation process was easy and quick, no dripping or leaks.  The filter seems to work great, you do have to reverse the filter on occasion. This product is mostly affordable, due to the long filter life (up to one year). One negative, the showerhead only has 3 or 4 water settings, most have 5 settings in this price range.",120,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,Worth the $. Easy to install. FrNkly it not any harder installing one of these compared to a garden hose outside your house.,23,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,"This is a pretty good sprayer but the plastic button soon leaks.  Needs washer kits often, so be prepared to buy them in quantity if you have like me several sprayers.  The positive is the excellent lifetime warranty and service by Kohler Customer Service.  I wish they made one with less plastic and better designed button. I have had to replace 2 with buttons leaking or coming off and was sent prompt replacement.",73,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,"First of all, in case you're wondering, the spray head is plastic, with a brass coating. The photo and info is vague on this. The hose from the spray head is unwieldy for the spray head and causes the spray head to have problems when trying to seat. I put a weight on it under the sink. Outside of that, it does the job and is better than the one I replaced.",72,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,"This spray is pretty good quality for a replacement kitchen spray.  It looks good, is a decent weight, and was fairly easy to install.  My only complaint is that it did not come with a weight to keep the hose tucked neatly underneath the sink.  Without that weigh, the hose can sometimes be a little tricky to put back under the sink, but it's not too big a deal.

Overall, I am happy with the product.",76,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,"Only one star from me.  First the quality of construction is no different from generic home store quality so forget the Kohler = quality equation.  Looks substantial but it's only looks, just chromed plastic.  Second the force of the spray is weak.  Suspect this is either the number of holes with too much volume per hole.  Either reduce the number or make them smaller.  And yes it is the sprayer because the previous unit worked fine.  Maybe mine was a fluke on the strength of stream so suggest buy locally and install before the return window is gone just in case.",101,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,"I ordered this because it was Kohler, well I'm very  disappointed. The only well made part was the hose. The handle and piece connected to the hose are plastic. Very cheaply made. Would definantely not recommend.",36,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,Mediocre quality.... Fitting on sprayer handle loosened after a few months and started leaking under the sink. Tightened it up and the leak stopped for now.,26,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,"I just bought two of these spray heads, unfortunately. Why two? Because since this spray head was installed only two years ago it's already broken twice--parts springing out, no fixing it. While it's out of commission so is our sink because it diverts the water from the faucet. Therefore I bought two assuming it will only be a matter of months before it breaks again and it's a big deal not to be able to use the kitchen sink when this happens. Very disappointed in Kohler and have already told the design/build firm that redesigned our kitchen to never use this sprayer. Tried to replace with another brand but the sizing was such we had to replace with this one. Sigh.",121,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,I bought this to repair a pedicure chair and it worked great.,12,8

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,"I purchased this to replace the original sprayer on my Kohler kitchen faucet.

Pros:  Looks good, installs easily, better connection than the previous design it replaces (old version had tendency to leak where the hose met the handle.

Cons: The only thing I don't like better than the previous model is that the water pressure isn't quite as strong through the sprayer.",62,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,"I bought two of these. The first lasted a year before the handle shot off and water sprayed all over my kitchen ceiling. I ordered a replacement a few weeks ago and after installing it today, found that it leaks! Now I need to return it and find another option.",50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,"I ordered this sprayer because it was the only one in the color I needed.  I wasn't positive of the color, but ordered it anyway.  Yes, it is the muted gold tone/brushed brass or whatever you want to call it.  But it matches my faucet perfectly.  I'm not crazy about the push button in the front of the sprayer because I've never had one before and it is taking a little getting used to.  But at least it's the right color and it works fine.  My husband said it installed perfectly easily.",92,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,"Excellent product, works better than expected, should be double the cost so was quite surprised, my spouse likes it's looks and the way it operates much better than the original that came with the sink",35,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,1,negative,"This Kohler sidespray is a total piece of junk.  It may look like it is made out of metal  but it is chrome-plated plastic so it won't last and will easily break.  The spray button has a very soft spring and is poorly located so when you grab it to use you often get a random spray you don't want.  Finally, the way the sprayer attaches to the hose is very stupid. It is constantly coming unscrewed and leaking water.  Ugh.",81,14

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,My last sidespray  had the button fall off and searching for a replacement was harder then I thought I would be.  It didn't seem like any of the large hardware stores had the sprayer by itself.  This one was the same brand as my sink/faucet and complimented the faucet perfectly.  In fact I like the look of this one a lot more then the one that originally went with the faucet and it works great.,75,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,2,negative,I looks good and installs easy but like someone else mentioned the pressure is miserable.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,21,18
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,4,positive,"This is a nice looking sidespray.  It matches my brushed stainless steel sink.  The nozzle pivots where it meets the hose, which I like, as it feels a little more maneuverable than the cheaper, fixed nozzle-hose connections.",37,19
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UJP6LY,5,positive,Thank God I could find this to replace the broken one.  Apparently shiny brass is outlawed at home product stores.  The cost was reasonable considering my other choices would not have matched this old house.,35,20
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,"There's about 1.8 inch depth in the clamping area, they open to about 3"" effective bite. Spring strength is about right for laminating.

These LOOK THE SAME BUT ARE NOT!!!  The spring pressure is harder the further you open them but if  you are clamping  thin piece of metal or wood it doesn't have enough pressure to adequately hold the piece down. I do not recommend these, its back to lowes where they are more expensive but I guess you get what you pay for!",85,3

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1,negative,"These are not at all like the photo in the picture. The grips look like they were painted on, not thick at all like the photo The clamps do not open very wide so I could not use them for the intended woodworking purchase. Unfortunately the cost to ship them back is more than what I paid, so I guess I just lost out on my money. Maybe I can use them for something at work... think they will hold stacks of paper together! :/ ?",86,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,"Great simple clamps. I like the red handles, it makes them easier to see.

I will probably buy more, since I use them all the time and this size works with virtually anything. If I need to secure/hold larger objects, I would use larger bar clamps (but that goes without saying, use the right tool for the job).

The only thing I had to change was: I glued the rubber tips and handles to the metal so they wouldn't slide off.",81,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,Good enough quality for my project. Delivery was fine and on time.,12,7
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,1,negative,"These clamps look nothing like the picture. These clamps have a straight profile whereas the clamps pictured have an arched profile. This means that the clamps open to only 2 and 1/4 inches. If you are clamping two small boards together they will do the job. If you are looking for 2 and 3/4 to 3 inch jaw openings look elsewhere. I have given the 1 star rating due to the fact that the pictured clamps, and what I received are totally different.

Update: Well I am glad that they changed the picture to what the clamps really look like. All of the plastic coverings have come off the clamps at the time of this update. I really did not expect a lot from the clamps, and my rating would have been around three stars, but with the picture being wrong and the jaw opening size being incorrectly stated at the time of my original purchase. 0ne star is about the right rating.",163,8

The deals is not as cool.
You're better off going to Home Depot and buying better quality clamps for 99 cents or so.",28,12
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,5,positive,They are heavy duty and the springs are strong. They seem to hold as well as expected. I'll use them all the time,23,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FY5A0K,4,positive,They do what they need too. I had purchased another set of pretty much the exact same things (6in Heavy Spring Clamps) from another manufacturer and they had a much stronger clamping grip but these do the job. Really good for gluing or joining parts together.,46,14

The party was for my 3 yr. old daughter, but I wanted to have something her older brothers and cousin could enjoy, so I got them swords and they slayed the dragon pinata!

We used it for a scene where all the kids were knights battling a dragon, and it worked out fine.  I gave it slightly lower marks for durability because it ended up breaking at the neck instead of bursting open, but that was fine.  We saved the head and used it to add in shots later with water shooting out of the mouth with the garden hose, making it look like the dragon was shooting water at the knights.  Lots of fun, I would buy it again if I was doing another similar party.",119,5

I barely got 2, 10.5 oz bags of little snickers, Twix, Milky Way, etc in there.  I was gonna put cute little pencil erasers in there too but I can't fit anymore in it.  Disappointing.

Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,"I agree that the body cavity is a little on the small side, but overall, I found this pinata to be really cute and the quality of it is as I expected it.  I feel that it is a reasonable price for what you are getting.  We are using this pinata as a ""Jabberwocky"" for my stepdaughter's ""Alice In Wonderland"" themed party.  After I hung it up for a couple of days he straightened out nicely. I didn't have the issue of it being crushed or broken, as some have said.

Had to re-tie it up to continue the game without the head and then that didn't even last for a couple more players.  Most kids didn't even get a turn.  It was a disappointment and I actually had kids crying because they didn't get to a turn to hit it!  booo!,101,32

After everyone got a shot at it, my son chopped its head off on his second try.  It took about 8 hits total before it broke open.

Some candy flew out enough to distract the children so that I could rip it apart a little more and get all of the candy out.",92,34
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,"I ordered this 1 week before my 4 year old son's knights and dragons birthday party. With the two day shipping from Amazon prime it was on my doorstep two days later. I was definitely impressed with the processing speed.
The pi&ntilde;ata was a roaring success. We uswd it first as a party decoration. The kids enjoyed screaming and running away from it during their make believe play. The red wingspan was perfectly frightening.
Most of all, the kids had a blast 'fighting' the dragon. We had seven 3-5 year olds striking with foam swords and it lasted two rounds before succumbing to the knights' determination. All kids got a few good shots--- twice. So, props to the production for making it the perfect balance between sturdy and vulnerable. (And just FYI, the sweet spot to hit is the bottom of the belly).
This was worth the money and was by far the best decoration and activity at the party.",160,35

Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,"It worked for about two kids with a couple of swings each.  It broke at the neck, but below where it was suspended.

We used miniature candy bars and I could only get about 20 pieces inside. The product was made very cheap and when I moved it, I was afraid it was going to fall apart. My three year old took the first swing at the pinata with a plastic baseball bat and it cracked open right away therefore, not leaving many swings left for the other children. I would not recommend purchasing this pinata for an older child's birthday party.",100,45

Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,"Not what I was expecting. The thing is tiny. Barely holds any candy. It came all smashed up. I had to glue the wings,eyes,and not sure what to do with the tail. It's totally bent out of shape. I'm so embarrassed to hang this up.
If I had time to get another one, I would.
When I saw this online it reminded me of the Ender Dragon from Minecraft. My son is so into that right now. I figured I'd surprise him...So sad.",83,48
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,Big! It was nice and took a while to break.,10,49
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,Hit it 3 times and busted open. Looks cool.,9,50
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,"Piata was great, except it was broke when I got it.  It was sent in a bag.  Should have been sent in a box so it was protected.",28,51
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,My pinata was broken the neck was half torn one of the wings was torn not happy at all was not worth it at all and the prize not worth the size.,32,52
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,"This piata lasted about 10 little kid hits before it was literally sliced in half by a 4 year old.  When it arrived, the wings were flopping down so we had to use wire to get them to sit up like in the picture.  There wasn't much room in the body for filling so we had to poke a small hole in the head to get more stuff in.  On the positive side, it did look nice once we had it stuffed and full of goodies.  It was just disappointing that it broke so easily.",95,53
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,"The entry point on mine wasn't really clear because the plastic seal was missing, but the back of the neck had a weak joint which I used to fill with candy.  I also used construction paper to make flames.  It was very nice.",43,54
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,The piata was just too small. Didn't hold very much candy. And it got flattened during the shipping process. Disappointed.,20,55
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,The piata was okay.  It was much smaller than expected and didn't hold much candy.  It did ship quickly and looked similar to picture.,24,56
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,Broke open after 4 swings. Fun for our first piata. Easy to fill and our birthday boy and guests really enjoyed having something different.,24,57
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,"The dragon piata that I received was different from the one that was pictured. It was similar, but still not what I thought I would receive. Will not be ordering from them again.",33,58
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,"this is a good pinyata but i wish it had more room inside for candy, i had to rip extra room in the tail and head to fit all the candy i bought for it but other than that it look great and the kids loved the dragon pinyata",49,59
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,coolest item ever!! worth it! Used this for my daughters Disney evil villains party as malifacent and it was a big hit.,22,60
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,"Took only one hit and fell apart.  Very sad birthday party kids and disappointed parents.  Not only is it really too small, it almost ruined my son's birthday.  Thankfully, we had a backup piata.",34,61
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,Adorable. The kids loved slaying the dragon and reaping the rewards of candy and trinkets from the dragon's belly. Would recommend.,21,62
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,"A lot cheaper than if I would have gotten from a party store. Worked great for our ""knight & princess"" themed party. It was even slayed by a knight. And shipped quickly.",32,63
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,This was perfect for our sons birthday party. Plenty of room to stuff with candy and it was made of very good quality and actually took many hits to crack open.,31,64
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,Bought it for my son's birthday party. All the kids had a blast with it. It went really well with the How to train your dragon theme,27,65
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,"We are evidently spoilt by the pinatas we have had in Mexico, which are made from papier mache that is set as hard as concrete!

The black dragon is cute (read pretty small) but the main issue was the strength - we had 6 kids at the party and the first one did all the damage. The rest of the kids never got a chance to give it a whack - which caused more grief than we needed. We won't be buying this again.",84,66
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,"My son and his friends really enjoyed this pinata.  My only complaint is that the tag said it had strings for the kids to pull to get the candy to come out, but there were no strings.  We ended up using a drum stick to break it open.",48,67
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,"I choose this rating because it broke after the third swing...by two small eight year old boys. It is very small. SAVE your $ and double up on brown bags and use that as a pinata....old school.  That way, everyone can take a turn to swing! Seller did have fast shipping though.",52,68
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,We ordered this for my 5 year old's party. This pinata was cute and exactly as it looks in the picture. However after three direct hits (from a 5 yr old) the pinata snapped right off at the neck. Not to mention it holds very little candy because it is so narrow. Not your best option.,56,69
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,1,negative,Just received it today. I have never seen such a small pinyata.... Nothing will fit in this. Big regret!! Quality is okay but big disappointment size.,26,70
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,4,positive,"I bought this dragon pinata, because of the Amazon reviews I read and the price.  It was about $18 when I purchased it.  Around $10-15 cheaper than other dragon pinatas I had seen.  The reviews were mostly all positive, so perhaps I had high expectations.  When I received the pinata, some of the colored paper on the dragon was loose and the wings were bent terribly.  I'm sure this could have been prevented had it been shipped in a larger box.  There was no way to fit it in the box they used without breaking it's wings.  Aside of that, it was a sturdy, well made pinata.",107,71
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,"I bought this pinata for my son's 5th birthday and he loved it. In fact, he loved it so much he didn't want to destroy it so we had to take all the candy out of it and now the dragon hangs in his room. My other two sons love it also. It was a good deal. The wings and the tail were squished a little during shipping and the wings didn't stick out like it does on the picture, but I would buy it again.",86,72
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,2,negative,"The Black Dragon Shaped Pinata is cute and pretty durable. I bought two of these at the same time...one did not come with a nylon loop to hang it with. Had I bought one first, I would NOT have bought another. I would not recommend this to friends looking for Pinatas. The whole idea of a pinata is to be able to stuff it with lots of candy for kids. This is the smallest Pinata I have ever seen. You also cannot stuff candy/toys in the Dragons head...well this is almost half of the Pinata. The recommendation is to only stuff 2 lbs. of candy in it...I don't know how you could stuff more in there. The candy also needs to be small, so you can pack as much as possible in it for the 2-4 kids it will satisfy. It also does not stand up as in the picture...you have to hang it. I had my soccer team beat this thing to a pulp, then gave them a pre-bagged bag of candy afterwards as they each did not get very much. I think this was designed by a dentist.",190,73
Toys_and_Games,B0018A6KY6,5,positive,"I was seeking a durable dragon pinata and this is perfect. (We used the pinata a little differently, my three year old was not blindfolded. He slayed the dragon as part of his birthday party so I wanted one that could take a few well placed hits before smashing.)",49,74
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,"The game consists of about 40 stages as far as I'm aware. Starts off fairly easy and picks up in difficulty as you progress. It can get a bit repetitive at times, however since you can use different units in different ways to take our your targets it keeps it to a minimum for the most part. You'll also probably want to repeat stages so you can gather items to equip your minions with more powerful equipment.

Pretty fun I'd definitely recommend it.",83,0
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,"Not sure why there are a lot of hateful reviews here, but I'm really enjoying this game. The soundtrack and sound are great, and the gameplay is really addictive and very similar to that of Pikmin (it's even created by the same team). Upgrading your units is fun and keeps me coming back. I haven't beaten it yet, but I've put a few hours in and I'm sure it will be expanded even further with DLC in the future. Also, multiplayer!

The worlds look great, but the actual characters are a little lacking in detail compared to other Vita games. But the gameplay is fast and fluid and that's what matters most to me.

I picked this game up for $30 on a Lightning Deal and I think that's the sweet spot for it.",134,1
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,"This game is OK for the first half, but then the areas get cheap.  There are electric fences and fire traps that are almost impossible to avoid.  The game's difficulty doesn't increase due to a need for the player's skill to increase, but rather, the game introduces cheaper tricks and tactics in each new level and due to limited control of your army, the game becomes very frustrating.  I do not recommend this game.  Instead, invest your money in one of the other excellent launch titles like Uncharted, Rayman, Mutant Blobs Attack, or Escape Plan.",95,2
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,a great game to play on the vita one of best stragey game i played im glad i got it for my vita,23,3
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,"I purchased this game when I preordered my PS Vita. I should have waited. This game minus well be an app for a smart phone ( a free one at that) I believe it is a great concept, yet nothing else went into this game. You have minimal control, it is basically a one button does all action game (except for movement) I assure you, you will be disappointed with it. Luckily the gamestop I purchased it at, let me return it for a preorder of Unit 13. So far I've been extremely happy with my Vita and all the games I have (Uncharted, Wipe-Out, Ninja Gaiden, and Dungeon Hunter) This game was an extreme disappointment. If you are planning on purchasing it, wait til it goes down in price, I'm sure you will easily be able to get a pre-owned version any day now. I believe most people who made the mistake I did of purchasing it will be trading it in very soon, if they are not able to return it. Ultimately it is your decision although I believe the majority of PS Vita owners will have serious buyer's remorse.",192,4
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,Each levels kind of repetitive but it's an awesome game good to plan a pinch when you don't have much time to play through a whole game,27,5
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,Nice little addition. Specially since it doesn't take up precious space in the Memory Card.,15,6
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,"Garbage. Waste of money. graphics are so sloppy. Controls are terrible.
Gameplay is not fun. characters are so small on the screen, everything blurs together.",25,7

i got it very quicky and it was great
the music is amazing and the game is fun",21,8
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,Do not waste your money.  This game is absolutely terrible.  My understanding is that the game makers are struggling to come out with games that can be played on the Vita.  But this is a game that could have been skipped in the development process.  The graphics are ok.  The controls are easy.  The concept is cheesy.,57,9
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,"This game is for no reason bad but its not the best of its kind either if your really want this type of game play play the Pikmin series.

Score:6/10 Mediocre",31,10
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,"I got this on the cheap when I first bought my vita, and was very disappointed. the graphics are crud, and the gameplay isn't very good. In addition to that, there are only a few music tracks and they repeat over and over again.",44,11
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,I love this game. the music is great and the game is fun. shipped fast and well packaged. its just what I was looking for,25,12
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,4,positive,"Overall, I like the game. The theme is dark and humorous, right up my irreverent alley. I picked it up on sale for $20 and I feel it is worth that price.

Pros:
The soundtrack is all metal
Fun, semi-mindless game play
The goblin's reactions to things are fun

Cons:
Repetitive
Not much strategy involved",55,13
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,2,negative,Between the thrash music and monotonous control its like being in the army corp of hell to be sure. This game has no real replay value and is slogging to make it through the first time,36,14
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,1,negative,"For something called ""Army Corps of Hell"", I expected this to be a great action game, but this game truly does not live up to it's name. As it is a Square Enix game, and 2012, I thought the graphics and gameplay would be that much more enhanced as they have created some of the most memorable games to date. Not a game full of intense action as it's name implies, I was bored within the first twenty minutes of playing.",81,15
Video_Games,B002I0GY9G,5,positive,"Good game, long but beatable. Never seams boring, but some times repetitive. Completely original style and game play, like no other game.",22,16
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,"Love the features and design of the controller but i must have received a dud. Two weeks in and the controller would start giving random inputs and randomly turn off in the middle of a game.

Also, shipping took longer than expected but that was FedEx fault.",47,0
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,"Had one of the Xbox 360 style sticks with dead spots, then the pin sleeves in the controller end of the cable have started recessing into the connector and it stops working unless you fold the cable under the controller. I have only taken the cable off a few times & I'm very gentile with my equipment so for my $100.00 I will be expecting a refund from a company with a long history of low quality products. Madcats should be out of business. Grade A Military components my ***.",90,1
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,"I love this controller. No slow turn, great grip and modular design was a major selling point for me.

Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,4,positive,"So I bought this controller because I really wanted to play The Last Of Us but I despise the standard PS3 controller. I swapped out all the sticks and the dpad for the Xbox versions and used the trigger swap feature to make the triggers the shoot/aim actions. It works great and does everything I expected it to. Overall I'd say it's worth it if you can afford it. I paid about $50 for it here on Amazon but I wouldn't pay the $100 retail price. Major cons: Wired controller with a short cord, the bumper buttons feel very clicky and kid of cheap, and the overall build quality vs the cost of the controller.",115,4
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,"Do not buy,  this controllers buttons stopped functioning after about 18 hours of use.  The D-pad buttons were unpredictable,the left analog stick completely stopped working I could go on and on about failing parts.  I will say its very possible I got a lemon from the reviews I read/watched! However for the price, quality control should be squared away.  Also the PS4 is coming out soon and most serious gamers will be buying the new system, with a newly designed controller/ from what I can read is going to be phenomenal, so If you're reading this soon after I write this just practice a little patience!",106,5
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,4,positive,So the controller is absolutely the best controller on the market in my opinion. However the cable that was sent to me was defective and after a few weeks it started glitch ing up on me. So I called mad catz and they said they would send me a new cord but I had to pay to ship the defective cord back to them which would be around 5 dollars. So in total you are spending about 10 dollar in shipping! In conclusion the controller I highly recommend to anyone who is a serous gamer.,95,6
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,This product does not work have tried 2 different ones and am now getting a full refund for the malfunctioning product. The buttons were pushing themselves,26,7
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,So dissapointed with this control.  should have listened to other reviews.  Buttons would get stuck all around making my games so hard to play.  Not recommended at all.  Item was returned and I returned to my regular PS3 controller.,39,8
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,I was very excited about this controller but there's to many fawls. The PowerA Fus1on Tournament Controller is better for true gamers like myself.,24,9
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,So I got this controller and all I gotta say is man is it nice. Everything works great. However if you wan to use the d-pad for fighting games might have to shell out another 15$ for the fighting d-pad version from madcatz. its a little switch out part. I wasn't sure how good the controller would be but it works like a charm. yeah its 80-100 bucks depending on sale but its worth it and if something breaks like the stick/pad easier to pay 15$ per part than spend 40-50 $ on a new inferior controller and madcatz gives a 2 year warranty.,104,10
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,"I purchased this item as a gift, and I was so happy to hear that it surpassed their expectations.  I would purchase this item again in a heartbeat and it comes packaged very well.",34,11
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,"The controller performs great in my circumstances, but when it come to the multiplayer side it has a few bugs. I put it thru 20-30 hours of cod time, at the end of it all the playstation controller is still superior. The mlg controller just doesn't perform we'll, bugs pop up all the time. Idk how nobody else wrote about that, but the main issue I had was the controller not performing well.",73,12
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,"I will start out saying this is one of the best controller i have ever seen. There is no lag in the thumb sticks and i got my off eBay kinda used. I have tested this controller on games like; God of war, uncharted, resident evil; metal gear solid, and there is no lag buttons feels great. So this has lag in thumb stick is all false will with mine it is. Plus madcatz have been good to me. I would differently by other one its just as good as the duel stock.",93,13
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,"don't buy this. i had it for less than a week when the d-pad stopped functioning. its a waste of money. I expect this kind of shoddy work from Mad Catz, i guess, but the MLG ought to be ashamed to put their name on this.",46,14
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,1,negative,I got this controller for my husband as a gift and at first he was excited about it.  He plays a lot of PS3 games and goes through 3-4 controllers a year from wearing them out.  This seemed like a good solution since he would be able to change out the worn out parts easily.  When he first tried it the buttons were sticky and register without any contact at all.  Several communications with Mad Catz and they determined it was defective and it is being replaced.  For $100 I expect it to work.  If the replacement works I will post another review.,103,15
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,5,positive,This controller is amazing. It is super sensitive and very durable. It is nice to fianally have an super high quality customizable controller.,23,16
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,"Overall, it's a decent controller, but it isn't worth spending $100.

As some of the other reviews stated, the D-PADS are flaky, and even running through the menu options it doesn't function. If I can't accurately navigate the PS3 menus or the in-game menus, how do you think its going to function when playing a game??

There are no dead zones, and I had to increase my sensitivity for Battlefield 3 for it to match the similiar behavior from my dualshock 3 controller.  The sticks are a little slow, but they do jump a little (but no deadzone!).

The bumper buttons are too stiff.. after a few hours of game play, my hands were actually tired from having to really hit the buttons hard to make the work.

I used the controller for probably 10 hours over the past 2 weeks... and everytime I switched back to the dualshock 3.. I performed much better in BATTLEFIELD 3 than with the MLG PRO controller.  It's a nice controller, fits in my hands well, but has some silly little flaws that completely ruin it for actual use.  For $100, some of those simple things shouldn't exist in the final product of the controller.",201,17
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,"Ladies and Gents , save your money , this is not what you think stick to the dual shock 3 controller, i just got mine in the mail and just sent in back in less than 3 hours of owning it and playing with it. Take my word for it.",50,18
Video_Games,B0063BCQ20,2,negative,"I bought this controller at d1. There is some PRO, but in spite of all the PRO, the 4 analog sticks sucks. they are too sensitive and their range are too restricted. so the DUALSHOCK 3 is much better.
wasted opportunity.",41,19
