All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"These are very thin, pull off easily without residue (rare!). The only odd thing about these is that on the crease, it actually had cut out slits along it, so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket/shirts.",45,0
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"sweat went right thought within almost 2 hrs of wearing it, not the best",14,1
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,So far they haven't really worked - won't stick to the fabric of my jacket.,15,2
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"I have tried several brands of shields, and most don't stay attached all day/evening. This purchase resulted in a great product that stayed put for as long as needed.  Love them and am hoping that I receive an equally excellent product when I need to reorder!",46,3
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"They do not stick well to the fabric. Bunch up, not comfortable.",12,4
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,It did not stick to the material of my shirts,10,5
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,My wife thinks that these things are great.,8,6
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,The item does not adhere  to clothing very well. It's basically pointless to use this product. Very disappointing indeed.,19,7
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,These shields were too flimsy. Did not sick and bunched up. Will not purchase again.,15,8
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,The shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket - I had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well.  just be mindful when you take the jacket off/put it on.  I will continue to use these - much improved from older versions that would come off.,56,9
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,Perfect for the Victorian Era Ball.  Now I don't have to wash the whole dress after every event.,18,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,Very hard to position. Not worth the hassle.,8,11
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"The idea seems great but once I started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat.

It's kind of a give and take, on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side its not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating.

Maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck.",70,12
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,Great product!  I used these for a series of interviews that I wouldn't have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview.  They worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used.,35,13
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"I bought 3 brands of dress-shield and I tried these last. These were thinner (like the 2nd brand) and I understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin, they are useless!!!!!!!!! People who buy these, sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time, money and  embarrassment. If you perspire, avoid these. If you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes, good enough!",75,14
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,"Helped prevent stains, but did tend to slip a little.",10,15
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,"I can see how these may not be the best for a shirt. However, they've saved me $$$ on dry-cleaning for my work blazers. A nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it's awesome to get a few wears out of each during EITHER a big client meeting or a hot spring/summer day. These will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure.",63,16
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"These are good in theory, but they don't stick to my clothing.",12,17
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"barely sticks to clothing, ends up bunched and then unattached",10,18
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"The adhesive doesn't seem strong enough. Several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when I applied them to silkier fabrics. On the plus side, these pads are quite thin and quiet.",41,19
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,It's not sticky and the material is poor.,8,20
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,They did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay.,23,21
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,I've only used this once. It worked fine.,8,22
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,I would not recommend this product. very bad quality for the price I paid.,14,23
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"Great idea, but held up poorly. Kept peeling off and sticking to my skin. No bueno.",16,24
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"Great concept, in theory...but I find they don't fit well in blazers (as I'd intended to use them).",18,25
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"These are perfect to protect your clothing from sweat and staining and odor. I use these in blazers mostly. They're perfect! I will say that if you're sleeves are tight, this shield will be difficult to apply/stay in place when you put the blazer on. They are the perfect size for the underarm and you can't tell they're there. These are must-haves for long work days.",66,26
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,I was very impressed. I plan on ordering from them for all my tattoo supplies.,15,0
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,I really like my gun. Run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,15,1
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,When i got this it had a few problems. Including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it.,21,2
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,The power supply went out on me and never worked again.,11,3
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also,12,4
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,Its doing good so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos . I love this item,23,5
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,machine is fine but the ink sucks had no problem other than the ink sucks terribly just doesnt mix well with skin I guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe,34,6
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink,21,7
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,"It is a good starter kit, but over heats with bigger tattoos, power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems, very nice people, i would recomend this kit",34,8
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up,49,9
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,The machine came within 4 days of me buying it. But the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily. A warning to first time tattooer's this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own. Also please for my own sake don't use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit) but i've never heard of the brand and something tells me it's bad ink. Other wise it's a perfect machine for beginners.,102,10
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,The kit came 1 day late but its cool . Lol the grip is not the one they show it's straight. N ink caps white no biggie . Thanks  you.,30,11
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,It didn't come with a grip! I waited forever and I searched everywhere and there was no grip,18,12
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,"I LIKE DRAGON HAWK PRODUCTS  , BECAUSE YOUR TATTOO KITS HAVE A GREAT PRICE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT IS STARTING OUT TATTOOING AND I CHECK OUT OTHERS BRANDS OF TATTOO KITS ,BUT NO  ONE HAD A BETTER DEALS ,BUT DRAGON HAWK IS THE PLACE TO START IF YOU LOVE TATTOOING AND WANT  GOOD DEALS OF TATTOO KITS, P.S WOW!  YOUR KITS ONLY HAVE A BIG BLACK INK BOTTLE THAT WILL LAST ME AWHILE AND SAVES ME MONEY, THANKS AND YOU GOT A COSTUMER FOR LIFE.....",86,13
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,Good for the money everything is working well just don't use this ink!,13,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,Great fun product.  Looking forward to the next dress up party. Going as the tattooed lady.,16,0
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,What a waste of money..this product is waaaaayy over priced for it's poor quality! I bought this kit to have my best friend (pro artist) draw an idea I had for a tatt on my arm. We followed the directions to a T and it still came off within the next day..the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use. One marker never worked bc it was dried up. And the adhesive is a joke..it's messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross. You'd honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers..and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice..invest in a real Henna Tattoo Kit..,114,1
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,I wouldn't recommend this product.  It's just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes.,13,2
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"pens work beautifull, but  after 3 days sometime less you need to remove.  Definatly not lasts lasting for weeks.  the latex covering feels gross and doesnt last long.  I will not purchase again.  Company did send out quickly.",38,3
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"I was disappointed with these. They're basically sharpies. They function the exact same way and the colors aren't true to the lids. It's fine to have them if you're expecting markers but they don't make convincing, or lasting, tattoos.",39,4
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"product does not stay on for more than a day,  Ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo. nice colors though!",22,5
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"Love love them where have these been,!  I love to change up my tattoo.  Never permant. Thank you love it",20,6
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"They don't stay at all, it says 2-3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and I was sadly disappointed.",20,7
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"This was really fun and I'm glad I got it because I enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough. They all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones don't work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos don't usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long. Either way, I still really like it and recommend it.",66,8
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"Needs many, many sheets of transparent tattoo paper to work properly. They're not included in the kit and not mentioned except for in the instruction sheet. do not buy from here maybe buy from the seller instead. These are just permanent markers with glue/adhesive. don't waste your money on this item.",51,9
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"The product is not as advertised.  Mine didn't come in a box, the cleaner and tattoo remover wipes were not in foil.  The tattoo remover is very dry, without the liquid mentioned in the how-to video on the Bewild website and took three wipes to remove a test patch of the topper.  The topper dries sticky and gets full of lint and who knows what.  the pens are OK with good colors.  Too bad the kit is so poorly put together.  Bewild get your act together!",86,10
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,The ink washed off without the sticky stuff. If you use the sticky stuff then the sticky stuff sucks off the fabric of your shirt and the whole thing ends up looking like you have black balls of dust stuck all over your skin and you look dirty and are sticky all week. Its like having the remains of a large bandid stuck on you but with a drawing underneath it. Also the yellows and light green pens don't even show up on skin.,84,11
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"Not what I though, there just like color makers, not worth the money",13,12
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,My daughter has enjoyed this set very much and has given lots of friends temporary tattoos,16,13
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"We had bought several different types of tattoo pens from area craft stores. Most of them had at least half the pens dry and useless and nonreturnable due to store policies. We bought these on amazon based on a friends recommendation and were pleasantly surprised.  Colors bright and vibrant. All the pens were in new condition, not dried out like the store pens had been. My only disappointment was that there really isn't a lot of ink in these, they dry up much faster than regular markers. For the price you would think they would last longer. I'll be buying more. Wish there were more colors or choices of colors.",110,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,One pen was dried out when I got it and the rest of the pens dried out after coloring only three tattos and they were not large ones. Very disappointed.,30,15
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"This was a gift,  came in a cheap plain box.  A lot of the pens do not seem to work.  The fine tips don't seem to work.",27,16
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Great alternative for kids who love to drawn themselves.  Ink lasts for a few days,15,17
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"The product is ok. You're better off getting the 18 piece version, or none at all, because I got multiple red, green and yellow markers. The yellows hardly show. The ""tattoo remover"" wipes are literally moist towelettes you get at restaurants. The most impressive part of the pack is the sealant, which is essentially watered-down glue. You're better off with Sharpies or other thin permanent marker (That doesn't run through the creases of your skin, mind you), Elmer's glue, water, and rubbing alcohol. Things you probably already have.

If you DO decided to buy this kit, I suggest a thin layer of baby powder slightly after applying the glue. This SOMETIMES keeps the sealant from collecting lint.",117,18
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,This product is really good pens work really well and it is very fun to use. Although the top coat is quite sticky after it dries put really nice way to make it stay longer. It fun to design things.,40,19
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,The thick sides only worked on all my pens. Couldn't get any detail out of them,16,20
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,The fine point on the markers did not work.,9,21
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"These markers are awesome but they do come off way too easily, even with the protective coating. Having a lot of fun with them at parties though!",27,22
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"Ok my daughter does Cosplay, these pens were so great for her costume, they stayed permanent and no smudging. She had arms and neck tattoos for 5 days.  I do wish we could get more cleaning wipes but were able to do with it.",44,23
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"So I got them in the time frame it, which was wonderful and all...BUT like several people have said they come dried out. I had never even used some of them the first few days i had them and they were dried up. ONE had mold on the fine tip! Im like what the heck?! Also they don't last more than 2 days if you even run a wash rag over it while bathing. Very disappointed.",76,24
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,The pen ink does not stay on like it says it should and when u put the adhesive on top to keep the tattoo longer it makes it look like it has a dark haze on it.... Tried to email the company because when we first opened the box of pens 3 of them were dried out.... So honestly I will stay with the sharpies!!!,65,25
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Love them! I think my daughter loves them even more! So fun to work with. I like being able to change--not really into permanent body art. These are perfect for that!!,31,26
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Some of the pens were dried out which I did not expect.  Did receive it in a timely manner.,19,27
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I really like them, awesome product. The shipping was very quick. I was surprised.",14,28
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Some colors don't look nice on the skin. One pen was open and thin side don't work.,17,29
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"This kit was a gift for my teen daughters.  They have a lot of fun with it.  The tattoos don't last long even when you put the protective material supplied, but they still enjoy it.  I would recommend it.",39,30
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"I was so happy when they came in the mail. I opened them up, used them and thought all was well. the ink didn't run when I took a shower, but when I went to use them again they wouldn't work. If you happen to be looking for a one-time use, then you found it.",55,31
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Did not work well... Did not last... The two black pens stop working before I could finish the first temp tattoo. Not worth the money. Just use eyeliner or a sharpie.,31,32
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,My daughter loved this gift. Awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each.,19,33
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,These pens were defective.  A very disappointing birthday gift.  Half of the pens were unusable!,15,34
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,This kit is great for any artsy child! This was definitely the favorite Christmas gift!,15,35
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,I was really excited to get all of the different colors. However I found that it wasn't that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks. It's fun but I was disappointed,52,36
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like regular mark pens work nothing different just more  ink less,19,37
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,Does not stay on longer than one day,8,38
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Use these quite a bit and they stay on for a long enough (I don't use the covering either),19,39
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"look its a demo thing, if u wanna make sure this is the design u want and placement, i say get this...kool lil kit to play with, before getting a real tattoo..im solid on this! thanks",36,40
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,Worked really well. Need more black pens in the set though,11,41
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I didn't buy this and Im not recommending using temp tattoo markers. Use sharpies they have cleaner, clearer colors that show up well. You can get sharpie off easily with hand sanitizer or alcohol swabs and warm water it's simple so please don't waste your money when you can use sharpies.",51,42
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,I like to play with them. They are a bit to easy to come off. Fun to play with though.,20,43
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I bought this for my 15 year old niece & as far as I can tell she was thrilled with it!
She wants a tattoo when she turns 18, so I thought this would help her make that decision.",39,44
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"They are good colors and even without the coating, the design will last a few days.  Only issue is that after you first do them, you need to let it dry a bit and even then, a bit can rub off.  Very fun.",43,45
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,It was a total waste of good money being thrown in garbage.,12,46
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"Looks real, had several people come up to me and comment- hard part was telling them it was a temp!! Glue is sticky even when dry - use transparent powder to keep lint from sticking to it and keeping it clean after every wash.",44,47
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,I like it but its to low when I try to watch movies it is dim so what I'm saying here is its height is bad but otherwise its preety good.,31,0
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,"This fit my Trio perfectly,also you have a better grip on your tablet. I 'm glad the tablet is well protected now from breakage!",24,1

Great purchase - you won't regret it.
Came with a FREE stlyus pen",25,3
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"Elastic clips were inconsistent on both pieces we purchased. The inconsistencies allowed the tablet to not only slide back and forth, but would slide right out the side and ultimately would hit the floor as though it had no case at all.",42,4
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,Does not work its just another universal case just as someone else said you have to remove it from case to use camera,23,5

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,Its ok but not what I thought it would be. I brought 2 and I'm not as happy as I could be. That could be my thoughts only. I don't dislike the cases. I wouldn't buy another one. In all the case is good and protects your tablet very well.,50,30
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,"For the Price it offers More Protection Than the Soft Cases, But, The Tablet Fell From the Arm of a Recliner & the Screen Still Cracked Because the Case Doesn't Lock.  if you Have Children or Pets, I Suggest a Case With a Locking Latch",45,31

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,This cover does not fit the Trio Stealth. The corner pieces do not stay in place and are not large enough to hold the tablet. The case does not stay in the upright position when trying to stand it up.  Very disappointed.,42,36
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,I HAD MY TABLET IN THE CASE AND IT STILL CAME OUT OF IT AND THE SCREEN SHATTERED ON MY FLOOR,21,37
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,"The prongs to hold the case in place always slip off, never keeps a hold. That makes the tablet unstable and it falls out",24,38
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,Bought these for the kids' Christmas present. Not too happy with them. The corner holders are constantly slipping off. Doesn't feel very stable.,23,39
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,The tablet keeps popping ouy of the little brackets. Not good quality at all. Having to buy a new case drom a different company,24,40
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,The case fits which is great as the tablet I bouggt is oddly shaped.  The elastic bands on this case makes it good for most tablets.,26,41
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"Good quality materials. Well made & fits my tablet perfectly. Like the bright color, magenta, & the wipe clean finish. Would  recommend this and buy another if needed.",28,42

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,I was totally disappointed.  One of the straps pulled out within two days.  I would have sent it back but I had already thrown the bag away and box with all the Christmas paper.  Definitely would not recommend this to anyone.,41,45

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,I its perfect for my 10 in tablet....It was a good buy I like it..keeps the glass safe from damage,20,48
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,The tabs to hold the tablet keep slipping off. They let the tablet slip around rather than hold it tight.,20,49
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,Had looked everywhere for what we needed and this is exactly it!!!! Perfect Fit to protect our Christmas present to each other :),23,50

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"When I received it, it was the holidays and it was a gift to go along with a tablet that I had purchased. After the holiday and the excitement wore down we found that it is not as sturdy as I thought. Also there is no opening to take pictures with the case on the tablet. Not happy with it but I learned my lesson. You get what you pay for.",71,53
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,"The case still allows the tablet to slip out, even when you go to close the case. Not good at all. It was a waste of money. I will buy new ones.",32,54

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,Tablet was hot pink when I ordered orchid purple.  The stopper for the stand doesn't hold and causes cover to open and fall from table.  The four holders keep slipping and tablet comes out of case.,36,57
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"Advertises the case is for the ""Trio Stealth G2"". However, in order to take a picture you must remove your tablet from this case before you can take a picture. Most cases you can leave your tablet right in the case while taking pictures. Also,this case does not stand when reading as shown in picture, it falls over. Just for those two reasons alone this case is worthless.",68,58
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,Advertised for Trio tablet.  However there is no hole for the rear facing camera so you cannot use the camera if the tablet is in the case.,27,59

Wish that there was a better selection of color like black one red is ok",21,60
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"I really like this tablet case it fits the trio stealth-10 perfectly, the claws hold the tablet very snugly to the case, there is no room for play that would allow it to fall out. The color is very vibrant and I love the black elastic band that holds the case tightly closed, and the bonus stylus fits perfectly in the ear plug outlet so it will always be available.",70,61
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,The cover is nice but the fact that it was suppose to come with a free bonus stylus and it didn't was a let down...,25,62

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"I bought this as a gift for my dad since he also got the newest kindle fire, the Kindle Fire HD 10.1, and he loves it! Not only that, but it fits perfectly! The grips that wrap around the corners hold it tightly and safely. I recommend this to anyone looking for a case that will keep your device safe while still looking awesome!!!",64,66
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"I liked it a lot, it looks really nice on a hand and it doesn't look cheap. The only thing that was bad , few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly, so I had to fix it with pliers so that it wouldn't fall apart.",50,0
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"It's okay and I like it. However, it is cheaply made.",11,1
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,"The bracelet is very pretty but, not well designed it doesn't stay in place",14,2
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,I bought another one of these in silver and they both lose their color after wear for about 20 minutes in hot weather I'm never buying these again.,28,3
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,"I purchased this bracelet & ring combo for a teenaged granddaughter, because it's so unique. Also, it's a cute & inexpensive gift to give for no special reason, or to add to her Christmas gifts. I hope she will love it!",41,4
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,"Very ill fitting. ring too small, bracelet too big.",9,5
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,This is very flimsy.  I bought it for my daughter to wear to her senior Prom but the ring broke off before she even got the chain part hooked.,29,6
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,Is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways..I steel like it but ..is crapy,17,7
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"Product as expected, but (although stated it would be slow) was even longer than expected as other items ordered from over seas; on the same day can a week sooner.",30,8
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,The ring part broke off from the chain the first time I put it on,15,9
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,Broke! I kept the ring part because it was cute lol,11,10
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,Got this item today and it was already broken.,9,11
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,2.0,negative,Received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time I wore it.,19,12
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,"I bought this item as a joke for my grandmother, knowing it was going to be cheap since it was only $2.00. When she received it, the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring, or the bracelet. Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together. Even if you want to make someone laugh, or buy for throw away jewelry, don't!",68,13
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,"A sleek exotic piece they were beautiful on my model and My Date was complimented all night
I will check and buy from this company again",26,14
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,This item was well worth what I paid for it.  It was good quality for the price & I received it very quickly.,23,15
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"this is a really cute accessory. the ring is an incomplete circle so you can adjust it just right, the chain to the wrist is a good length. the one real drawback is it's actually pretty hard to connect he clasp on the bracelet part without help because of the weight  but I salved that by replacing the clasp with a magnate.",62,16
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,Kinda big I have small wrists. Very cute though,9,17
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,This thing fell apart like 10 min after I gave it to my Girlfriend. I would not recommend this to anyone. Do not buy this cheap thing. We didn't expect a high quality piece of jewelry as it was for Halloween but it didn't even make it to the party.,50,18
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,No sizes on it !!!!!! Biger than my fingers,9,19
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,Hate these pens!  The pens are NOT multicolored and the ink runs out after a few uses. would not buy again.,21,0
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,"I am a nurse, so I thought these pens would be great and easy to access attached to my badge holder.  This first one exploded the first day I used it all over my scrubs and I looked like a slob all day.  I thought it was just a freak accident so I decided to give another one a try.  The same thing happened.  There is definitely a flaw in the design and I will not be using them again.",80,1
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I use these quite frequently to take notes since I don't have a smartphone. The only complaint I have is that sometimes if you push the pen into its cap too hard, it will break. This is only a problem since the cap is what attaches to the keychain. Aside from that, though, they work fine. Great for carrying around in a pocket.",63,2
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I have no need to write with pink, purple or green ink.  Blue is OK, but Black is the best.",20,3
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"I need a pen attached to my keychain at work at all times.  I have always used the mini R.S.V.P. pens from Pentel.  Most stores in my area are not carrying them so I found these.  Sorry...but I hate them.  They are very small for writing, and since I attach them to my keychain, the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day!  (My other pens never broke, thicker plastic.)  If you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok.  I won't buy these again since I have found the Pentel pens I want on Amazon. Oh, and the chain they come on is a joke, totally worthless.",120,4
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I'll have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion, as described and intended, however I was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket, and it works very well for that. I unscrew the little keychain attachment, and the lid stays on in my pocket so I'm always ready to write in a notebook I carry; I frequently have a better pen, but not always. This one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen, otherwise it's a little too stubby. The product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter, but it works well for what I wanted.",130,5
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Honestly, if I had known the cap would fall or pull off so easily, I never would have purchased this product. I should have looked for push button or twist pens instead. These pens are small, fit well on a keychain, and writes okay, but I almost lost the cap(s) quite a few times. Due to the price point, it's not worth the time returning, but I won't buy again.",70,6
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These pens are the perfect size to put in my diabetic meter bag. Thank you so much!,17,7
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,Good deal for the number of pens. Definitely wrap a strip of tape around the head of the pen to keep the pen from falling out of the cap if you keep them on your keys/if they will be yanked around a lot.,43,8
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"These come in handy when you don't have a pen ready.  Just put it on your key chain and you will ALWAYS have a pen HANDY!
AMAZING item....Love it.  I've given away 6 already (close friends) & others I tell them where to buy them.
Keep up the good work with fantastic ideas.",53,9
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,Love these little pens!  They work great with post-it note holders.,11,10

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"pen constantly slips out of cap, preventing me from keeping pens on the key ring. more of a pocket pen than anything.",22,12
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,"Worthless product and I assume because it's cheap.
I lost 2 pens already in 2 days so obviously I bought the pen caps not the pens because it's the only thing it stay.
Very lose and weak.",37,13
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"Nice pens, good size for small geocaches which is why I bought them.",13,14
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,Chains break easily. Caps don't hold pen well. Pen often falls off my hospital badge.,15,15
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,"I've had these pens for less than a month, and I'm on the third one as the pens have fallen out of the caps.  I have the pen attached to my work badge; I work in an office setting, so there's not a lot to grab/catch on the pens, but they continue to fall out.  I've been walking across the office and had coworkers stop me because my pen is laying on the ground some feet back.  I would not buy these again nor suggest that others buy them either.",90,16
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,The pen doesn't stay in the cap. Using it as a keychain is useless because it falls out too easily.,20,17

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"Got these for my husband who makes deliveries and needed a pen to attach to his lanyard.  They are good, but as they are used over time, one fell out of the cap and got lost.  However, considering how inexpensive they were, I'd still buy them again!",47,19
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,Not happy after giving these out in stockings a few of them did not light up!,16,20
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,"Terrible.  The pens are very loose in the caps, resulting in them falling out frequently.  I've lost practically all of them ... waste of money.",25,21
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,I still have no idea why 6 colored pen with all black ink.,13,22
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,I wore them attached to my lanyard. After less than a week the pen didn't stay in the cap. The fit isn't tight enough.,24,23
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,The pen writes well. The cap does come off easily so it is not suitable on a lanyard or keychain. It is perfect to put inside a purse or pocket.,30,24
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"I'm always in need of pens when going out to events, dinner, movies when I have a small purse with me. These are SMALL and perfect! They're 3 inches long, black ink. I will buy more! Well worth the money.",40,25
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,I love these... These are great little pens and I have already re-ordered more... They write very well and I love the different colors... I am using them inside small survival kits...,32,26

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I needed very small pens for wallet and small handbags.  These are almost perfect.  The cap separates from pen barrel too easily.  A dried thin strip of water-proof fabric glue inside opposite sides of cap takes care of ""grip"" for cap.  Now, to keep my daughter from adopting them!",49,30
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,too small and pour plastic.  broke in one week,9,31
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Loved the pen at first, worked great and convenient to keep on my badge for work. Always had a pen to sign documents with, however the caps continually fell off  not worth the buy.",34,32
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,These pens are great as they fit in your pocket. I use them on a lanyard for taking notes in the field and they don't hang as low as a regular pen would. Amazon seems the only place you can actually find this pen size.,45,33
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,Exactly as ordered. Perfect for lots of places where a pen is too large.,14,34
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,I wanted to hang it from my lanyard but the hardware did not hold up and I lost the pen.,20,35
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"Time will tell whether the caps fall off, but so far, so good. The pens write well, no skipping. They don't feel ""cheap"" in the hand. The little O-ring on top of each cap is small, but I didn't have a problem fitting it onto a small flashlight's O-ring after I removed the chain. The chain itself is not sturdy to the eye or feel; essentially useless. I wouldn't trust it to hold. Otherwise, I'm pleased.",76,36
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"The pens themselves usually worked fine for me, but the caps do not attach strongly enough to the pens for them to be a good keychain pen.  I lost all of these within about a month, because the caps (where the keychain is attached) just did not stay attached to the pens.",52,37
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I use them allways, one in each bag.",8,38
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"No ink clogs, easy to put cap on and off. great for nurses who never can keep up with pens",20,39

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"I work in a hospital and purchased these to wear on my badge.  I was hoping for a pen that would be easily accessible and wouldn't get lost or misplaced.

Great idea, but not so great product for it's intended use.  I couldn't make any of these pens last more than a week before the pens started falling out of their cap.  With normal use, some of the caps cracked, and some of them just stopped clicking onto the pen.

It's pretty frustrating when you try to grab your pen in the middle of examining a patient, and there's nothing dangling there but a pen cap.",106,41
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"I don't know why I didn't look at the reviews first. I wanted to have pens on our keychains so we always have one. The cap fits the pen so loosely I really don't think it's going to stand the test of time.

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"Cheap and a great idea. Better in some ways than the nite eyez ones, because you don't have to unclip anything to get your pen, just pull free of the cap and write. My wife clips one to her scrubs pantleg loop. Plus, they're dirt cheap! Lose one, Goes through the laundry, no tears.",54,49
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I used these for work (peds nurse for labeling),so i always had a pen handy. Attached right to my ID.

Convenient otherwise",57,50

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I am definitely impressed with the pens. I quickly put one on my work keys and on my car keys. Never have to borrow a pen again. WIthin a week, both pens had fallen off without me realizing it. Caps need to be tighter.",44,52
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,just what the doctor ordered when you need a pen and don't have one.  Some more words to get past the minimum.  What a silly idea!,26,53
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I like that these pens all have black ink. The orange, green, etc. ink pens that you find in some of these sets have limited value if you are not a teenage girl. These pens are half the length of typical pens, but you can flip the cap over to lengthen them for comfortable writing. The small size makes these great for carrying in a pocket when you're on the go and the cap style prevents leaking. Construction is cheap and lightweight, but they are a decent value at less than a dollar per pen. The keychains seem pretty flimsy and I discarded them; didn't really want that feature anyway.",110,54
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,"Pens go in her pocket so when a patient calls, she's got the pen right with her to write with.  Great product.  She loses them a lot.  I will be a frequent flyer on this one.",36,55
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,I am a PE teacher and need pens to be handy for quick writing. I was totally disappointed of this product. The eons won't clip back into the cap after a couple uses. It got to be who can find that bright orange pen in the grass first activity. Save your money. Not a good product to attach to a key ring...,62,56
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Maybe I'm just hard on things in my pocket, but these things break very easily.  On every one of them the screw that connects the pen to the key ring pulls out of the cap, stripping the hole.  I've tried using super glue to put it back together which works for a little while.  Also the pen does not stay in the cap very securely.  Much prefer the Nite Ize pocket pen by Inka.",74,57
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These are great for my purposes.  I always need a pen that is easy to carry around and I'm the type that like to carry as little as possible so these are great b/c they fit in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans.  I never noticed them until I need to write something down.  I'm not sure why the description listed the product box with Product Dimensions 6.5 x 2.8 x 0.4 inches but the pens are 3.5 inches long and they are all black ink.  I was worried since the description mentioned Color Red/Blue/Black/Green/Purple but these are describing the color of the casing not the ink.  I needed simple blue or black but cringed at the description of the colors.  I can't believe that I'm excited about pens.,131,58

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"These pens are perfect for attaching to a lanyard so you always have a pen with you. The chains are reasonably strong; I've only had one fall off and that was when it got scrunched in a corner.

The pens are moderately tight in the cap. They don't fall out with normal use, but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be ""friction locked"", allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap.

The pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks, such as writing a signature or jotting down a note. There is no way you would want to use it all day, unless you have small hands.",128,61

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Although the pens write nicely, attaching the keychain to the cap of the pen was a horrible idea. I keep losing the pens throughout the day because they are not designed to stay in the cap under stress.",38,64
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These pens are a great idea but because there is no twist to secure the pen in place it is subject to dislodge  and be lost . Other than that it's a very handy tool .,36,65
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,like the True Utility pen the problem is that taking your keys in and out of your pockets the pen will pop off. I fixed this problem with these buy wrapping a piece of tape (electrical or duct tape) around the part where the cap seats on the pen. now I need to really pull hard so I hopefully won't lose them.,62,66
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,Kinda cheap and i got an ugly color not gonna be getting anymore. These are for toddlers,17,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,"Color that I received wasn't listed, but I still like it. It took a long while to arrive, but it was still cute when I received it. There's a wire going through the cloth so you can manipulate it all you like and it stays on fairly well. However, beware that when the wire breaks you basically have to throw it out or remove the wire.",66,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,"Love it, I wish you could choose the colors though. I received a polka dot black and white and polka dot teal and white.",24,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,This is cheap and a waste of money,8,3
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,This is nice i just wish i could choose the colors.,11,4
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,Really cute but was a different material than I expected it to be. I think it's satin.,17,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,You are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be a color listed. Not worth the money.,21,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,It's a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures. Material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it's supposed to be.,36,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2.0,negative,"I got some ugly funky color and while it looks cute on me, it's really small. I have a rather big head and so it doesn't reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model. It's also made of cheap wire so be careful with it.",53,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,I'm very disappoined. I ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material. What am I going to do with three of the exact same headband?,27,9
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,"it came a lot earlier than expected, I just wish I could've chosen the color of headband.",17,10
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,It's okay for the price got it sooner then expected wire started to poke out as soon as i put it on but easy to fix wish i could pick the color but i still love the one i got it is tan with orange dots,46,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,Do not like it at all. From the looks of the pic it was suppose to be one of the denim headbands and I received a light pink polka dot one. I have no use for it.,37,12
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,Very cute but i do wish I could've chose the color,11,13
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,"This is perfect for my daughter. She loves to collect this kind of headbands, and she's so happy!",18,14
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,This is a really nice headband to use whenever I'm washing make make-up before going to sleep.,17,15
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,Bought for my daughter. She mentioned that they were fantastic and she really liked them. The designs were girly and fit her style. I find them pretty too!,28,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,It came quickly and works great! I got one that was cream with dark pink polka dots!,17,17
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,All I'll say about this is I believe it's meant for kids . Not adults.,15,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,really thought these were coming as a set ....was really disappointed to receive 1 single head band...,17,19
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,This thing is a waste of money doesn't even stay between your breast. Maybe if you are a very large and obese person it might work. I'm small with very large breast this thing was like huge between my breast and kept popping out tried with a bra and with a bra under a tank didn't work,57,0
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Didn't work for me but was able to get a refund promptly. I think this is for larger chest ladies!,20,1

All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,I couldn't get it to stay between my 38D boobs- otherwise great idea!,13,3
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,I use this almost every night now. Tip: it stays in place better if you wear a sports bra. I would buy it again.,24,4
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"It cute. However my chest killed this lil bear. If you are above a B, don't waste your money.",19,5
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,Not a big help for my big boobs. I'm an H cup and was super hopeful this would help. It doesn't sit right or stay still. I'm like come on my boobs should hold it in but they don't. I missed the free return window bc I went out of town.,51,6
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"Sleep with this every single night, not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs. OMG, so fricking painful!  Anyways, since becoming pregnant, I want to sleep on my side a lot and so I am worried about wrinkles too I guess... but the pain... dear lord, it's so bad. I tried using a pillow, but this just slides in place and stays better... I mean it doesn't even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom!!! Score!",87,7
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Dumbest purchase of my life don't let it be yours. Cheap toy that is worth 50cents at best! I was shocked to say the least. Roll up a towel & use that instead.,33,8
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Doesn't work.. since has no straps the bear won't stay in place so it's useless,15,9
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,I didn't like this....it didn't stay in place.,8,10
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"It's a bit thicker than expected, I imagine for more generous boobs. But! It's very comfy to jam into my PJ top. Helps with pregnancy sweats and heavy pregnant boobies.",30,11
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"The Titty Bear is adorable, curvy and shapely like me.
TB is not deplorable, as you can plainly see!
Made of firm foam, a cover that does not roam, My Titty Bear stays with me...even when I leave home!  :)",40,12
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"doesn't work very well ,  it is very small , better use as a baby or dog toy .  better to  just use a pillow",25,13
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"I bought this bear on another website.  The other reviewers are right... this would only work well for VERY large boobs.  I bought the isima breast pillow, and that has straps that secure it in place.  Sometimes I put a comfy bra on too (over the pillow) to secure it even more so, and also I like sleeping in comfort bras.  I would recommend the Isima breast pillow!  I have size C implants.",73,14
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"This works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place. My primary complaint is, it doesn't rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts. I'll wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together (the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles) and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still. Need a TIGHT sports bra to hold it in place. At least for me. I'm 5'8"" tall, slim build, with breast augmentation. Might work better for natural breasts. Still use it though, I do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place.",116,15
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product. Works as advertised according to her. She finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place.,39,16
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,I've been dealing with sweaty uncomfortable boobs forever and titty bear is the breast!!!!,14,17
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,Helps to have a shirt or tank top on while sleeping.,11,18
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"I am a 38 DDD.  Even with a sports bra it did not stay in place and as I moved it came completely out of place.
Too bad because it is super cute.",33,19
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"Might work for some, but was too thick for me (natural 34DDD). The bear design is adorable but I went with the Bosom Buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me.",36,20
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,I have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all. Not worth the money!,18,21
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Well damn I missed the return window by a few days.  I have DDs and this thing is too big! It has to be for someone with FFF's. Or someone with Nat Geo tits.,34,22
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"Outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it's pretty useless, unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this doesn't stay put at all.",32,23
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"Love It! After researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles I saw this and thought, Ah Ha! It is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 DDD breast from smushing together. I notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases. Everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place. H&M has great long stretchy tanks I use.",77,24
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"I had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed.  It is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place (even with wearing a sports bra to sleep).  Ultimately, it does not do well what it is advertising to do.",51,25
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Funny gift for a friend. Love the name.,8,26
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"its kinda to big and honestly its not hard enough to stay put and to hard to sleep with to might work for some people it just did not work  for me
I think it will end up the dogs toy.",41,27
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,Got lots of laughs as a gift for wife and friends.,11,28
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"I love this! I've had it over a year now, and I'm starting to think I need a new one; the foam inside has become a bit mushy. I like it too much and will definitely order another.",38,29
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,Won't stay in place even when tucked into bra and shirt.,11,30
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,My name is Bear ( a handsome Westie) and I approve of this product.,14,31
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,Sponges are very soft. Perfect for blending. They do expand when wet just a bit. Cleaner works great too.,19,0
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,Great product for a great price.  Easy to clean and good product,12,1
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,They are ok. A little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult.,17,2
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,"Gave it 4 stars because the product is good, but I found out I'm not a fan of sponges for applying makeup. I like brushes better.",26,3
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,Four stars because thought they'd be bigger .overall there okay . I still need to try them out . So I'll update in a few .,26,4
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Not worth a penny. Sponges broke off handles within days. Don't waste your money.,14,5
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,Good price but not very good quaility. In this sense you kind of get what you pay for. Sponges are very stiff.,22,6
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,"These sponge brushes make blending my facial makeup a BREEZE!  Every time I need to do a heavy contour, I reach for these brushes rather than my beauty blender.  I find this product easier to manipulate.  They are sturdy and well built, and everything arrived intact.

The makeup brush cleaner is also very very useful.  I was easy to see when a brush was truly clean due to the residual makeup being very visible against the purple silicon.

This bundle is a great value for the price and I would definitely recommend this product if you frequently contour or blend your facial makeup!",103,7
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,"Only one of these sponges I was satisfied with and that was the teardrop; the other two seemed a bit flimsy.  When I used the cleaning item that came with the sponges, it tore through the sponges so I am no longer able to use them.  Not very satisfied with this product; wish it was of better quality.",58,8
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like I want,17,9
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,One of the pieces wasn't entirely glues on and broke off when I was applying makeup to it. But everything else was fine,23,10
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Cheap. Handle came out of all of them,8,11
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,Waste of money. Too small to evenly spread anything and soaks up all my product.,15,12
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful. They were smaller than I expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator/ blendor. They get the job done and I love them.,36,13
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,It feel a little to harsh for my face..,9,14
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,brushes are poorly made and fell apart after only using it twice.,12,15
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,cute........they apply concealer very well. no messy fingers...,8,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,It is somewhat a pain to use in that it's sticky and slightly burns upon applying. The color is lovely though and just the 'peeling' aspect is really cool.,29,0
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,Lighter than I expected but I love it !,9,1
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,This stuff doesn't work like I had seen it in makeup reviews.,12,2
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"My lips are stained pink!
So are my teeth
... And my tongue
After brushing my teeth, the toothpaste foam is pink.
My finger tips are also pink.
I would definitely say it does its job.
WARNING DO NOT APPLY ON THE GO! You will stain everything.",47,3
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,I love the color super cute. Does make your lips dry though.,12,4
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,i really liked this product although it looked darker than i expected,12,5
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"interesting! this color is a much darker pink than expected, but it is a pretty pink toned stain.",18,6
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,"This is a fun product. Goes on very sticky.  You wait til it dries and then peel it off.  The longer you leave it on, the darker the shade.  I would say it looks like you've eaten a Popsicle.",39,7
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,Don't buy this! Horribly disappointed. I anxiously applied this and immediately knew I made a bad purchase. Lips stuck together after a length of time given to let them dry. When I separated my lips a stringy blob pulled off of my lips. It was gross. Then it made me wonder what in the world is in this product to make it stringy and blob off.,66,8
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,I got this for myself and it works perfect and it actually came earlier than expected ,16,9
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"Product exactly as expected after watching some YouTube videos of girls reviewing this product. Apply quickly before it starts to dry. Also, make sure like are dry and don't put chapstick on prior or the product doesn't stain as well. Impressed this didn't try out my lips like most lip products do.",52,10
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"I love these. They are really great, they last pretty long and stay even when you eat and drink. They don't leave any marks or anything once you've finished applying it and done it right. However, for me most of it fadeafter about 6 hrs or so though and leaves a thin outline on the edge of my lips but that might be because I often lick my lips. My favorite color is lovely peach if you just want something light but sexy red is also pretty nice if you want a dark red color. Just don't apply it to dry and flaky lips.",104,11
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"This was a pretty fun product and slightly harder to use than regular lip gloss. I had Fun experimenting and applying it, I just had to make sure to get it off my teeth wen I was done. However since I did get it close to my lip color I had to apply it twice to notice a difference and use some pretty thick coats to cover up my lip well. Its a good lip tint and my lips look great but still had to put on clear chapstick since it kinda dried up my lips. Would buy again :)",100,12
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,"This just didn't work for me on any level.  I've heard alot about this type of gloss and looked forward to giving it a try.  I followed the directions and put the gel on my lips.  It was difficult to apply evenly and was very thick and sticky.  After leaving it on for some time I tried to peel it off, but nothing really peeled, it just was stuck and I ended up having to wash it off with a washcloth.  What I was left with was no visible difference in color whats so ever. I was pretty disappointed and this ended up in the trash.",106,13
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,I would give no stars if possible.  Extremely messy and difficult to apply.  It is very sticky and getting an even application is next to impossible. I threw it away.,30,14
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,"Absolutely useless. The gel is sticky, clumpy and so thick it pops the applicator off every time you try to use it. There's no way to even spread it so it can dry to peel off. Extremely disappointed.",38,15
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"Im kind of 50/50 for this lipstain. I like the fact the last long in ur lips and doesn't dry out my lips. Its a great idea. The only problem is very hard to apply, sticky and messy. It difinitely need some time to get used to it. This is good if ur not in hurry and had plenty of time since it take time to get the product to dry so u can peel them off. Overall I would buy it again.",83,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"Love it! It's weird to apply at first, and it's pretty goopy. But once you've gotten the hang of it, it's amazing! Dries out your lips (what lip stain doesn't) so have chap stick ready to apply after. The watermelon color is more red than I had expected. Lovely peach is a nice, light pink. Just bought another in the peach color!",62,17
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,Don't buy this cheap TERRIBLE LIP GLOSS. ITS THE WORSE !!  it's doesn't even apply to my lips. It's like plastic in a tube. Absolutely terrible,26,18
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,This stuff is so gooey it's hard to keep it on your lips for more than 30 seconds.  It feels gross and doesn't really peel off.,26,19
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,too dry on my lips. difficult to apply. and it barely shows.,12,20
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,to hard to get on straight..needs a better applicator,9,21
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,"This applies horribly, burns the lips, and is just gloppy. It doesn't ever dry to peel off, and is so gelatin like that it is next to impossible to spread over the lips.",33,22
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,The peach is a little lighter than I expected more of a very light pink it's a little messy but once you get  the consistency right it peels off easy and lasts all day and it's easy to remove I just scrub my lips and it comes off when I don't want the color any more,56,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Love my new nail polish ! Essie have a great selection of shades and I am very glad they  have this one back.,23,0
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Great color, but horrible formula!  It goes on thick and gloppy like a polish that has been sitting on a shelf for years. I expected more from Essie.",28,1
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"I love this color. I've heard a lot of complaints about the formula, so I was worried when I ordered it, but the bottle I got is a nice formula. It's not jelly-like, not thick. It's great.",37,2
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,I love the color and the consistency was OK for me but it doesn't wear well at all. I've worn it twice and both times it chipped almost immediately. I've only had it on for 36 hours and it looks like it has been on for a week...it is so chipped. This is not my usual experience with Essie polishes.,60,3
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"I had the original Chanel Ciel de Nuit back in the 90s and loved the color. I never had the original Essie Starry Starry Night, but I bought the revival today, and like all Essie polishes, I loathe the formula. They're always streaky and clumpy, and the brush is too small and hard to control. Color payoff is good after two coats, not as sparkly as the old Chanel it knocked off, but I wouldn't re-buy. About once a year, I buy an Essie polish, and then remember why I hate them. I should stick to Zoya.",97,4
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,All the colors are great but this one was the best.,11,5
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"I am sure the formula is great but the color just didn't work for me.  It was very shimmery and almost had a multi-color sheen to it.  Even my 2 14 yol twin daughters said it was ""too young"" for them.  However, I am sure someone else will love this color!  I had really hoped it would be kind of a blush-champagne color which it looked like in pix. (my bad)",71,6
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Beautiful color but chips after two days, even with expensive base and top coat.",14,7
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Well, it's a pretty color but that's about it. Chipped of the first day and the gel formula was very difficult to work with.",24,8

All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,Do NOT buy. Nail polish bottles arrived broken with nail polish coating EVERYTHING. AND they won't honor a return.,19,10
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Such a great color and really good coverage for a polish with glitter.,13,11
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"Great color, but chips way to easy. I do wash hands a lot but not long lasting.",17,12
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"Love Essie polish. This particular mix is pretty thin, but a couple of coats once dry is super cute. Will be using for the rest of the summer.",28,13
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,The consistency was too tacky and it was not as shimmery as advertised. I believe the original formula was better. However one coat was OK for my toes.,28,14
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"I don't know why Essie comes up in the 'luxury' category. I've never liked this polish; the colors are mostly bland, it chips quickly. Really this stuff is overpriced. It's not terrible but it's not high quality either",38,15
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,Very pretty color.  Perfect for a suttle look.,8,16
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Chipped within 3 hours of a professional manicure.  Would not recommend.  I am not a fan of Essie nail polish, especially after buying this.",24,17
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"I love Essie! Their nail polish is one of the smoothest applications I've found. The color has always been one of my favorite. It is light yet striking. I am normally not a fan of light colors but  This one has always been elegant, sophisticated, and timeless. I am so happy to have the color back on The market .",60,18
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"first essie polish of mine and i must say, besides the formula being a bit thick, its a great polish overall <3",22,19
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"I have no issue with the coverage or consistency. I took the polish to my favorite salon and had them do it. However, I'm 26 and I think the color is too blue for me. Maybe for New Years or Vegas. But for work...it's a little much. Looks like what a 16 year old would wear to a dance. Pretty, but not for every day wear.",66,20
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Got the nail polish when they said I would and it is great! Love the color and the ease of putting it on.,23,21
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"It certainly isn't identical to the original, but it is still a great polish! Semi-sheer gelly layer with slightly chunky square glitter, it does resemble a night sky, in a van Gogh kind of way--in that way, this one is probably more appropriately named than the original! Lasted a normal amount of time, and no staining.",56,22
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,Great color. I really like it. The only bad thing about glitter polish is the removal. I hate it.,19,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,They were given as gifts. They loved them,8,24
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Not at all what I expected. It's not navy or dark blue, it is very much a bright royal blue. And I guess all the sparkles in the polish adhere to the glass bottle or get completely buried under the blue, because there were little to no sparkles on my nails.

If I had known this, I would not have bought it, because I've never used it.",67,25
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Very thin formula, it takes way too many coats for it to even look like you have nail polish on. I would not recommend purchasing this one unless you want to go for a more natural look.",37,26
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,Very clumpy and goopy. Did not go on smoothly. Only used once.,12,27
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Not what I was expecting at all. Usually Essie colors are true to color, this is one exception. Once applied the color is iridescent, with a lot of yellow / greens tones and even with three coats, it's still translucent. I have a few other colors from this Retro Revival line and love them but this one is not worth the almost $9.00 I paid.",65,28
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Love this color! even more beautiful in person :},9,29
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,Either I received the wrong item or they are knowingly sending out something completely different. I received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them. No flowers or leaves at all and the beads don't even look like the little ones in the picture either so I'm getting a refund for this disappointment.,54,0
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,"When I ordered these, the description said silver. The ones I got were gold. They have since changed the description. Still, I was not happy.",25,1
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"The gold on these pins is VERY yellowy gold. I initially didn't like the color at all, but they ended up being pretty in my hair so I wore them anyway for my wedding.",34,2
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"Bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding. The pins looked very cute, I wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette, and I gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well. The pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding. Great product for a good price",66,3
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold.
overall, it looked great and is reusable.",26,4
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"I'm actually pretty happy with these! They are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I'm not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy, but overall it's not a huge issue. They still look so pretty! I used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well. I plan to use them for my wedding now as well. I do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well, but I couldn't find them anywhere.",89,5
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,I was looking forward to these and in the silver/white version and instead I got this ugly yellow gold color. Disappointed. Will not use these.,25,6
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,I got these to match my jewelry and Maid of Honor and they were perfect! I loved them and they stood out nicely against my blonde hair. They stayed in really well throughout the night and I got multiple compliments on them,42,7
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,"These hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day! During my trial, my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle. I bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair. We decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive. These hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost. I definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day!",103,8
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,The metal had a cheap look to it. Didnt end up wearing it.,13,9
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,They are very beautiful and of good quality. Unfortunately I only received 2 out of the 3 pins. The package looked like it had been returned. Overall beautiful.,28,10
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,2.0,negative,The gold is very cheap looking. I wanted these for my wedding but they look bad.,16,11
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,I ordered these for my wedding day and they worked great.  Easily adjustable to perfect your look and such a nice but simple embellishment.,24,12
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,"the gold color is very gold, almost cartoonish gold. but I have dark hair, and the accent color for my wedding is gold, so it'll work out fine. but it was a bit of a shock when I first saw it. quality product.",43,13
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,The gold reminded me of Willy Wonka gold.,8,14

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"They were really cute, but left my fingers green.",9,1
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"Leaves a small green lining on your fingers but that should be expected for how cheap it is, the green isn't even noticeable if you leave the rings on, and one did break within 2 weeks sadly but I'm still loving the others.",43,2
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"I would have gave it five stars but one of the rings bent, not that it was a problem because I fixed it like that. But still not the best quality.",31,3
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Just like a set of forever 21 rings,8,4
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,"Great gift good variety of rings with a nice finish.
Worth the money by far!",15,5

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,It did take forever to arrive but what can I expect it was super cheap and I think also free Shipping.  I'm very satisfied with the quality of the rings.,30,7
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,They were broken before I got the chance to open the bag.,12,8
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,All the rings are different sized and some fit some don't.,11,9
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,The rings snapped easily and the midi rings weren't very adjustable.,11,10
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,"I totally thought these would be cute for the summer/pool/beach. I would not want to take these in the water. The paint on it is all chipped and cracking.  There were 2 pieces that had jagged metal sticking out from the ring area.

3 pieces were adjustable and 3 were not. The ones that were not adjustable fit on my knuckles and we're not comfortable.

The metal is garbage. The paint is chipping and the sizing is weird. I might be able to use a couple as toe rings. Not worth what I paid for them.",96,11
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Came in as pictures the material isn't flimsy cute rings,10,12
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,They are made out of plastic. reminds me of costume jewelry for a 4 year old.,16,13
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"So I received my rings early, which was a big plus. They came in a small package and I was very pleased to see that they were perfect, although the rings seem to have the black paint chips, or something like that, stuck on the inside.",46,14
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,"They're cute, they're super affordable, they are just little trinkets after all. I got mine to hopefully spruce up some shots of manicures/nail art I'm doing. For me, not to wear for real :)",34,15
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,Poorly made broke as I put them on the first time. Cute style it it was made out of something else. Don;t waste your money.,25,16
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"Only one of them broke and I didn't like that one anyway lol. They're surprisingly sturdy for what you're paying. They're all different sizes. After a while, the color starts to get a little coppery. These rings are pretty good for the price.",43,17
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,"I like them, but they came it says it came in from Wish.",13,18
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,These are okay.. cheap metal so potential breaking.,8,19
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"These are really cute. They kind of bend, but it doesn't seem to be a bad thing. One of them bent almost all the way open while I was running around at work but it didn't break. As far as accent rings go they serve their purpose. Paint them with clear nailpolish so the won't make your fingers green.",59,20
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,"These rings are a cute design BUT the quality is that of a quarter prize machine at a grocery store, Save your money and wrap tinfoil around your fingers.",29,21
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,"These rings are very cheap. The metal is almost plastic-like. The designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped. Only three of the six were sanded, leaving sharp burs on the other three. I am dissapointed, but contented with the few rings of the set I can wear. I would still buy from this seller, as their service is wonderful and everything else I've bought from them has been excellent.",76,22
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,I was so excited when I received these. They are such a cute design. But they are so poorly made that one of them broke at a weak welding/soldering point less than 3 hours after putting it on.,38,23
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Plastic like.. Not what I expected. Most of them broke. You get what you pay for,16,24
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,Love these little rings BUT you get what you pay for. All the open/adjustable rings break within the first two wears. The solid bands are a bit stronger. Realize these are a trendy short term accessory.,36,25
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,very very poor quality. All the rings broke and crumbled after 2 days,13,26
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,Broke the second I pulled them out of the package.,10,27
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"I was skeptical at first.....but I love Azorro hair brush straightener......it works super amazing, wish it would let me post my picture with the before and after.....well worth the money. and Support is amazing",34,0
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,My hair is quite short so I use this on my top layers with much success. On the shorties underneath I still have to hit it with the flat iron. As my hair grows back out to chin length I look forward to only needing this brush. It's quicker and effective.,51,1
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Purchased this about 2 weeks ago and needed to give a review on it. I really like it a lot. Its a great addition to my styling products. So, it has a great feature of shut offing if its not in use for a long time. It heats up in seconds and keeps the temperature constant. I love how it makes my hair look and feel. I can do my hair in seconds.",73,2
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,Wasn't the same brush shown in the picture. Didn't work when plugged in. Sent it back!,16,3
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,horrible..... didn't work and burnt my hair don't bother,9,4
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,pulled out my hair and did not straighten at all.,10,5
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,does not work on curly hair as it states,9,6
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,this works great  it is much better than a regular flat iron,12,7
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Heavy and awkward to use.  You almost cannot use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings.  It does make a little difference but not enough to really notice.  The bristles will scratch your neck if not careful.  Would not buy again.,43,8
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"I really like this brush. And despite the fact that my hair is short, it still worked quite well. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",25,9
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"The product inside the box seemed like a duplicate brush. Did not have the temperature indicator on it. PLUS, did not even work when plugged in.",26,10
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Hair doesn't get as straight as advertised. It seems to snag African American hair.,14,11
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,Unbelievable piece of junk! I used it maybe six times. I wrote them and explained the condition of their product to them and they ignored me.,26,12
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,Tangles hair too much other than that great product,9,13
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,This Hair Brush did not work for me and I would like to send it back.,16,14
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"I was not sure this would work since I have extremely thick curly hair, so here it goes.  It does work! I let my hair dry naturally, and used the Ionic hair brush.  It really did work but not as well as my flat iron.  The pros is that is great for touch ups and it is easy to use.  This will be my everyday straightening tool, but when I want pin straight hair, I will continue to use my flat iron.  The Cons is that my daughters have already taken it over and I may have to order another one for myself.",103,15
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Love this product! It heats quickly, easy to use and provides great results.  Worth the price!",16,16
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Too heavy and bulky and I've burnt myself several times using it. I only used it 4 times...now it's collecting dust.,21,17
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,It works a bit better than I expected still experimenting,10,18
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,Great for straightening your hair.  I use a comb just to get tangles out prior to the use but like it better then a flat iron.,26,19
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,Like it just not pleased with the number of the heat. Overall it's good.,14,20
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,Didn't work and my hair isn't even curly.  Just wanted it to smooth.,13,21

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"This brush works amazing on my course dry hair!!!!!  I only need to run it thru once, and move to the next section of hair!!!
There is 1 draw back, the buttons to raise and drop the temp are on the side where your fingers are when using it.",49,23
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"Easy to use and I get great results which is important to me since I have very coarse, frizzy, kinky, unmanageable hair!",22,24
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,It was a gift for our daughter. She tried it but it didn't work on her hair. It left it as frizzy as it was before she started.,28,25
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"It really works great, but the only problem I have is the buttons should be in a different place because I held it I was also either adjusting it up or down and off because my hand presses the buttons as I held it to do my hair. other then that I do like it.",55,26
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Not impressed. I have short hair with swoopy ends. The brush is not able to do my ends at all.,20,27

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Not happy with the quality of this product at all. And being I paid so much for it makes me even the more unhappy..,24,29
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"I ended up returning it.  It was so big and bluky, and it did not stop the frizz.  It actually made my hair more frizzy.  BUT - the company was really great with my return and if you have thick hair, this would probably be perfect!",46,30
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,I am so happy that I bought this.  It really does straighten your hair and is so much less time consuming than a hair straightener.,25,31
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"It's an excellent concept, but this brush just doesn't get hot enough to do my hair and I had it maxed at 415. I have thick, long and kind of wavy hair and when I read the manual for the recommended heat and I had it maxed at 415 and it took a good 10+ times through the same section to get it even mildly straight. Plus, I believe it states that it's static free? Def not.",77,32
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,I had some difficulty using the brush if my hair wasn't 100% dry and tangle free.  When using the brush I kept touching the temperature controls and changing the temperature. I got this brush so that I could straiten my hair everyday but it's a bit to difficult to do that.,51,33
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,It takes half the time to straighten my hair and not get burned !!!!!!,14,34
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"Good morning, i live in brasil and i boughy on My vacation.  After30 days , its broken and o use only 3 /4 times. I sent this product to my son , he lives um USA! Is ir possble to change ?",42,35

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,I purchased 3.  Two for me and 1 as a gift....I hope it works.  But I used mine 1 time each.  They both stopped working.  AMAZON REFUNDED my money and I bought a better unit!!! Thanks AMAZON!,37,37
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,"I was really disappointed in this hot hair brush ... The power button is right in the middle of the handle where your hand naturally is placed when using the brush, so you are constantly turning it off -- super poor design.  I had been looking for a brush that was actually a hot tool rather than just a hot air brush, but I noticed that it took way more effort to straighten my long thick hair with this than with a flat iron.  It would not tolerate very much hair in the bristles, which is discouraging because the brush head is rather large.  Even after straightening with a flat iron, using the brush to give it some lift, body &/or curl, I just couldn't make it happen without investing much more time than I had patience.",137,38
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,It broke one week later when my aunt used it. It's basically a blowdryer,14,39
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,Gave as a gift. Didn't get hot enough,8,40
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Very very dim. Also, the color temperature of the lights are cool blue. Wish I could return.",17,0
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"This is such an awesome idea! I don't have a real makeup vanity to put everything on and also do my makeup. I hung this on the wall right next to where I have my makeup stored and it is perfect for doing my makeup or eyebrows. It has a light so it's very easy to see. The one side is magnified so it is easy to see when you are plucking eyebrows, or eyeliner. I put it up so the installation is very easy. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",99,1
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"The amount and quality of the light provided by the thin strip that encircles the mirror is inadequate. A good source of light from somewhere else close to your face is needed. The hardware works well, easy installation, looks stylish, useable area of mirror on the small side.",48,2
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"Just like in the hotel. Very nice and makes me feel pampered. No more leaning way over the counter to see in the mirror and I love that it pushes back out of the way. I would recommend this mirror. Lights up nicely.
I did receive a discount to review this item and this is my honest opinion not biased.",60,3
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"Supporting hardware does not seem very sturdy but it works very well.  Mirror functions perfectly.  My problem is the lighting which I needed for shaving in a dark location.  I could use a brighter light, hence a 4 vs 5.  Batteries were not difficult to install.  Overall a goodproduct .",50,4

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Terrible product. The quality of this mirror is awful. I bought this after my old wall-mounted mirror fell and broke, and I thought the light would be great. The light flickers and won't stay on, and even for the few moments it is on, it is so dim it is worthless. I have taken it apart twice and replaced the batteries (not easy to do either) and no improvement. The mirror surface is also pretty small and magnification is not good. I tried emailing the seller twice to see if my unit was just defective but they never bothered to reply.",101,6
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,I love this mirror. I didn't want to spend a ton. It does exactly what I need it to. Looks great too!,22,7
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Wall extension seems flimsy but I never got far enough to find out.  The battery case extremely difficult to twist open; once it is, the edges of the open case are sharp. (Yep, it cut me)  Returned for refund.",39,8
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror was easy to install and works fine, but the reason we bought it was the lighting. The LEDs are very dim and almost useless.",26,9
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,Mine appears to be defective. Needed a wrench to screw the part that holds on the mirror. I couldn't do it myself. Also very difficult to take the mirror apart for battery installation.,33,10
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for, but two weeks into ownership one of the brackets on one of the hinges broke. There really isn't kind of hack or easy fix either, appears to be shoddy materials and/or manufacturing.",43,11

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror is just fine, however, the perimeter light is so soft or 'low' that it's pointless.  Don't buy this product for the light feature, you'll be disappointed.",28,15
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,The mirrors and extension are great.  The light is worthless.,10,16

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror is far too heavy for the extension arm and it's very wobbly.  I could never get the mirror case open to insert batteries, so I can't rate the usefulness of the lighted feature.",35,19

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"It was a bit hard to open to get the batteries in but once done, the light is really quite bright. Not sure why others said the opposite. Installation was very easy and it seems well made. Not at all flimsy.",41,26
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"This product is heavy as it is expected to be, but the screws and the mounts they give you need to be better. I have this horrible fear that the cheap drywall screws that came with it are going to break and I am going to end up with 7 years bad luck. The mirror is beautiful though and the led is just bright enough that I can use it and not be blinded by it like some mirror lights. Overall I probably would buy it again , I'd just invest in a better mounting screw set",97,27
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,The LED light isn't as strong as it sounds like it should be. The construction isn't all that sturdy either. The mirror part is wobbly and I'm always afraid it's just going to fall off onto the floor.,38,28
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,This mirror works great! The light is not too bright.,10,29
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,This has never worked. The switch is bad and it will occasionally flicker but will not stay on.,18,30
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"All in all it's decent for what it mainly is, a mirror. The magnification is exactly what I was looking for. The light was a perk, but it's not very bright and really doesn't light up anything extra that my bathroom light doesn't. So I don't really use it.

The arm is a little loose from where it attaches to the wall. It swings slowly back towards the wall, but this could be from how it's mounted? But basically it works just fine for what I need it for!",89,31
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"The quality of the wig is outstanding and the style is very similar to the picture with a little trimming/thinning/styling. There is a lot of hair, evenly distributed through the lace cap and has sewn in clips to attach with ease. It was a little large at the top of the wig and it was very easy to sew a few tucks to take out some of the bulk.

The write up clearly states the color may be different than what is in the picture due to the monitor or lighting. The wig I see on my screen looks like a light brown with blonde highlights. The wig I received is the color of the highlights in the picture and is more blonde than light brown. If you are looking for light brown with blonde highlights, you may be disappointed. I like to play with different wig colors and styles and I am ok with the color. At this price you are getting a quality product and really can't go wrong, unless you aren't willing to do a little trimming or accept a slightly different color.",186,0
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"The color IS darker than expected, with an auburn tint, so it didn't look quite right.  I donated it to a charity, because it is pretty and well-made.",28,1
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Loved it a little shorted than I expected but get lots of compliments,13,2
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,Actually a very cute wig too small for my head,10,3
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,My mom loved the quality and fitting of her wig.,10,4
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Wonderful wig. Fit very comfortable. The style is well kept. When you get get it and shake it. I have to rinse it in water to rinse off some residual product that's on it. But fine after that and the style holds. Brushing the wig makes it look even more satisfying. These wigs""exact"" same product are sold at a large online store for double the price. Buy it here. You'll love it",72,5
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,Nothing like the picture. Too much hair on top. Looks silly. And color was a red tint.,17,6
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,Didn't look this good.  Not nearly as full.  Returned,9,7
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,"Way too dark for my complexion. It is light brown, not blonde at all. I guess it's the lighting in the studio that makes it appear thus. I had to return it.",32,8
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,No stars. Looks nothing like the picture! Don't buy this! There aren't even any form of bangs and it's MORE than fluffy!!!,22,9
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,This wig has an entirely natural look.  Really flattering.,9,10
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Nice look and quality at a very reasonable price---the picture is a good representation of this product!,17,11
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"The wig I received has much more length than in this picture. It is a very well made and a beautiful color. It can be styled, but it will not look like this photo. Great service, shipment was received within a week!",42,12
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,Does not look at all like this picture in style of color.,12,13
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,I bought for my mother. It looked ridiculous on her and she hated it. It was way too puffy. It would be nice if there was a size chart. I'm not sure if I can even return  it.,38,14
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"Actually, for the price, it was a surprisingly nice wig.  Just not a style I could wear. Very different than what was pictured!",23,15
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Bought this for my husband to be Princess Diana, it worked well. Pretty high quality, with a little adjustment would work as a trump wig too.",26,16
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,Be aware you need to style it. It doesn't look like that when it comes,15,17
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Bought this for my 97 year old mother. She's in rehab and she needed to replace her previous one. Didn't want to spend too much fight unseen. I am amazed at the quality of thus wig. It looks just like her real hair!! It is thick bug feels soft to the touch.  Easy to style big combing. Looks just like real hair. This was supposed to be until we could take her hit s new one, now we'll keep this one permanently. Looks better than the expensive ones we've bought.",90,18
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"I ordered this for a Halloween costume, it wasn't as curly as I needed so ordered a different one.  This one is very well made though.  Good fit.  Some are very small, this one would work for medium/average sized heads.  It's a great and believable color.  Feels good on.  Not quite as layered in person but a nice wig.",59,19
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"very thick. I'm still trying to reduce the 70's volume. But wear it often --just not for ""dress-up""",18,20
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Great wig. Very cute on and was ready to wear - no shaping needed. Color was close to my own medium blond.,22,21
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,The color is a little light but the short cut is super cute. Just right for putting on after swimming.,20,22
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,It came brown not blonde like it stated and doesn't even resemble the picture!!! I hate it!!!! I wanted blonde!!!,20,23
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,The wig looked nothing like the picture and you could see the scalp part where the hair is weaved into.  It just looked cheaply made.,25,24
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,It is a real crummy made wig. I tossed it in trash.,12,25
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,It doesn't look anything like the picture. Looks too cheap,10,26
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,1.0,negative,"This wig was horrible. It was actually missing some ""hair"" in places. Thanks for doing a cancer patient wrong.",19,27
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,For the money great wig.  Just needed trimmed up a little and color is perfect.  The company is also great for customer service.  Recommend.,24,28
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,Don't hesitate.  This is a beautiful wig.  So many local shops had inferior products. So glad I took a chance on Amazon.,22,29
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,I would not recommend this product for those looking for a 'color correction' pallet like I was. I found better products at Sephora.,23,0
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,I was not impressed with this. The makeup is impossible to use and the brush broke when I took it out of the package.,24,1
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I have not really tried working with it much yet but will get around to it.,16,2
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Smaller than I expected but still a good size.  Sponge is adorably cute. And brush is very soft.  Some colors aren't very pigmented but others are.,26,3
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Honestly. If you cant spread this you aint applying it correctly. This is the second time getting this pallet. The colors are great and go one well IF you put it on the RIGHT way. Ive had my first pallet since nov. - january. So it has a good life span. Also the brush is amazing. Still learning the blending sponge since not 2 days having it my ex friend stole it. But other then that im givinf this product 5 stars. If no one knows how to contour id suggest a few youtube videos on how to contour and such!,101,4
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,A lot smaller than I thought it would be  and it's very shiny on the skin I could have gotten better quality for the same price at Walmart so I'm pretty disappointed,32,5
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,My daughter loves this makeup kit.  Only complaint is it'snot very sterdy packaging and not very much makeup.,18,6
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This is very cheap makeup. This is the kind of quality you'd see from a dollar store or in a children's play makeup kit. I tried to use it and it caked up all over my face.,37,7
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,The brush is the nicest thing out of this set. The blender sponge is uber small and the colors are very hard to use. They don't apply easily and blending is difficult.,32,8
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,"The pallete is extremely pigmented which I liked. However, the brush and the sponge that was supposed to come with it never came! All in all I was kind of disappointed.",31,9
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,didn't blend at all and the sponge didn't even come with it just saying,14,10
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Doing what name brands are for a lot more reason cost! Thank you! This is allowing my budding make-up artist learn the tricks if the trade for a lot less!,30,11
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i just thought it would be bigger and come with instructions... but the product is great and it was fast shipping,21,12
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I am so happy this was actually supposed to come on January 5-10 so it came early I love the brush and the sponge plus I rubbed my finger in the color and it came off very pigmented and I'm so excited to use so thank you so much!!!,49,13
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,The brush that comes with it is a little weird but I love it,14,14
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,"very cheap packaging!  product looks very low quality, over all.  save your money!!",13,15
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"Horrible quality, the only good this is the brush, save your mondy",12,16
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"VERY NICE PRICE, I LOVE  THE BRUSH VERY EASY TO APPLY THE MAKE UP , IT EVENS THE MAKE UP ON THE FACE",23,17
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"Don't care for this,brush came in hsndy with my other contour kit though",13,18
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"It comes with a good brush and normal sponge, the box material is of cheap quality but overall the price matches with the products..",24,19
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This should be offered at a dollar store. Oily and very bad quality makeup. Dont waste your money.,18,20
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,To me this feels more like Halloween makeup than every day makeup. It's a constancy issue for me.,18,21
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,All of the inserts were melted and fell out with no brush,12,22
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"Though the brushes were good, the makeup was cheap, heavy, cakey, thick and terrible.",14,23
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"This kit is very small. Everything is way smaller that you may think, but the makeup itself is good quality. The beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless, i threw it away, its almost like a novelty toy. The brush is great and so is the makeup, but its creme. That means you have to put a few drops of water on the color you're using and water on the brush before using. I really like the palette colors. I would recommend for the price.",87,24
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"I like the tacky-ness of the product. It really makes powdered colors stick, and look vibrant.

The brush and sponge did not come with the makeup I received. :(

Amazon refunded the money for this item back to me and said it was ok that I kept the product since I didn't receive all the pieces. This made the experience super positive for me! I ended up spending more money on Amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one!",86,25
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This is like childrens fake makeup. The brush has bristles just falling out of it, I could have got better quality makeup at the dollar store.",26,26
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"Just wish it was bigger! Love the brush, but almost out of favorite colors within no time!",17,27
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"I love this product,  it was just as described!",9,28
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,AWFUL!!! DO NOT BUY!!! I can't even use it. I knew it was going to be not the best quality but honestly my 3 year old sister would have better play makeup than this,34,29
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"so much yes!!! i love this pallet. this is great for experienced artist or a true beginner. it has so many colors to choose from you cant go wrong, great for contouring!!!! the blender is a nice size and shape and the brush is great! i deffeintly reccomend this",49,30
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"Love my contour set, I have purchased this one before and loved it as well.",15,31
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,Pure wax does not work at all..wish i can get a refund,12,32
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"i didn't like it at all, unfortunately. It made my face break out. Would not buy again :/",18,33
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This product is okay, but tens to leave the face looking oily.",12,34
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I love this product. I have watched a bunch of videos on YouTube on how to contour and figured I would give it a try. I ordered this kit and couldn't wait to try it. After a few attempts I think I have got it down! I would totally recommend this to my friends and relatives. I have enclosed a photo of before and after :) This is a definite product if you want to try to contour.,78,35
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"Reallly nice brush and blender, the kit is good quality also just very limited quantity for each color.",18,36
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,The product is OK. I might try another product to compare.,11,37
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This product didn't meet my expectacions because the makeup was all over the place,14,38
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,"Love the this , I just wish the Beauty blender was bigger and I didn't get the brush that it says it comes with ",24,39
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"Works amazing, I love the colors and it was really simple and easy to use. My first time it turned out perfectly and I'm loving the contour. It could use a little more volume to it though. There isn't very much in there for 10$",45,40
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I love it especially the correcting colors works great brush is great too and the sponge is small but works good,21,41
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,It's fun to use the different shades. The brush spreads it on nice and feels soft. I think it makes a great look,23,42
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Well worth the money. For $10 you have a contour kit with a free brush and beauty blender. The colors are alittle light but they still work they are very creamy not thick. I highly recommend.,36,43
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"It was exactly what I expected, very good, high quality and worth the price",14,44
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,Product was alot smaller then I expected but good quality. I love the brush.,14,45
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I like it but only used a few colors and it runs out fast.,14,46
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,One of the better ones I have tried.  Matches skin and doesn't make me break out if I accidentally leave it on overnight.,23,47
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"I would never buy this product again or recommend to ANYONE. The creams are so terrible, they can barely be applied!! They are NOT spreadable. I might just throw this right out..a day after it came in the mail. SO DISAPPOINTING.",41,48
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This sucked. Didn't work at all. I would never buy this again. I was extremely dissapointed,16,49
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,The beauty blender was smaller than expected but everything else was perfectly fine and came on time.,17,50
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"This was a multi purpose pallet that I loved to use, I am planning on purchasing a new one as I just recently went through my last one after almost 2 years.",32,51
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,i have ordered this over and over again love it,10,52
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I like this product just fine for the price. I have another set by another company and they are about the same. It's not supposed to be clown make up. I'm satisfied with it. There's something for all skin tones.,40,53
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I actually really like it...im a tomboy so i don't do makeup. When I got the pallet...i just went on youtube for how to's and I really like the look. Gave it 4 stars because it's a little thick...but good.,40,54
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This was terrible! It almost looks like a kids set for makeup, plastic ! I couldn't even use it really because the contour won't even come out of the circle with the brush! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",38,55
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"The maroon color is nice and the blue Isn't bad, but I won't use the other two now that I know that the magnet doesn't work. I was really sad to figure out it didn't work, but it still wasn't a bad price for the maroon and blue and they look okay without the magnet feature.",56,0
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,"I love the color and everything BUT when I opened it half of it was spilled EVERYWHERE! And I could only use the red and silver. Extremely disappointed. I love the other colors and it wears nicely, but I just really don't like the fact half of my order was unusable",51,1
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,I love the colors but the magnet did not work AT ALL!! Good thing I had ordered another magnet to go with these. I tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked.,39,2
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"Problem wasn't with the polish itself, it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all. I tried everything so I am disappointed.",27,3
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,I recieved the package and they looked fine. I did not open the individual color boxes when I recieved it since it was a gift for my niece. When she opened them the next day one of the bolttle was broken from the top and color was leaking out and starting to dry already. The others worked great I just wish that the other one wasn't broken.,67,4
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,I don't recommend it. It's clumpy and hard to put on cleanly.,12,5
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,Love this magnetic polish. I have worn the silver/gray magnetic for just a day and already receiving complements on the shimmer.,21,6
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,"This product is terrible. I tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work, the polish is clumpy- like it has sand in it or something- so it can't be used as regular polish either. I tested the gold and the blue. Very very disappointed. I would have asked for a refund but I bought them awhile ago and am just now trying them.",67,7
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,The brushes are sruck together and takes double the time to dry,12,8
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,"I got a  3D magnet gel polish. I tried them on my nails ( I work at nails salon and I know how to use that), the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality, seem they had sands inside and can't work at all, especially the silver and gold one. I will never buy it anymore. Bad and bad",63,9
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,"looks great and simple to apply.  Just hold the magnet for longer then the 10 seconds it recommends, roughly 30 seconds and it works nice.",25,10
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,I was so excited for these  polishes to arrive today. Unfortunately two of the four colors are unusable. They were  mostly dried  into a big clump. I even tried using gel thinner.  The other two colors worked great and the magnet worked perfectly on them.,45,11
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,I love this polish!  It's beautiful and exactly as described!  The shipping as fast and the seller is super nice!!,20,12
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,"beautiful colors, don't think the magnetic thing woks well...but the colors make up for it",15,13
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,Beautiful colors. The cat eye doesn't seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me. I'll practice more. Update: after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4. I kept them in the original box all the time so it wasn't light that was cutting them.,59,14
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"I purchased...came quickly. Two of the products look as if they had been previously opened, the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out. I give 2 stars, one for each good product, the blue and silver.",40,15
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"I bought these solely for the star shaped magnet. I found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish. I'm going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if I can get the desired results. Still holding out hope on that. I cant give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is. Its lose, runny, and it pulls away from the nail horribly. By the time I was done applying it, the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that I eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing. And I STILL had bare spots. The formula is subpar! The only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately, which would end up being more time consuming. I don't recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure. So on top of the bare spots, I cant even see the start mark. I cant wait to scrape this off my nails!",180,16
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,"Initially I ordered this product and received a duplicate colour (ie: blue, red and two silvers instead of gold and silver). However, customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end I received all four colours. I have used the blue, red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark, slate colour. I haven't tried the gold yet but generally I like the Sensationail Brand a lot.",88,17
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,This stuff is awesome! The colors are very pretty and the magnetic stuff works great! Even comes with the little magnet wand!,22,18
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,I cannot figure out how to get the magnets to work right. They seem to barely work which just makes the polish look sloppy.,24,19
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,"The colors are pretty, was not sure I would like the dark colors but after trying the blue I discovered they are pretty. Have to master the magnet though, did not get it centered the first time.",37,20
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,"It took me a while to get the hang of it, but this polish is quite awesome! I got so many compliments on the starburst!! People were in awe and wondered how I did it!",35,21
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,These were awful. I love sensational products and normally they will last a week. These only lasted a day or two before peeling off and the design looks nothing like what's on the package.,34,22
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,"Birthday present for daughter, she loved the set.",8,23
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,There were horrible. Weve used other polishes by this brand and loved them but these magnetic polishes are dried out and clumpy. Seller wouldnt comment back on returns. Such a waste as Ive seen these in videos and they look like they would work great.,45,24
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,"I opened the package of the blue, which was completely sealed, took out the brush, and it was all wonky and clotted... I cleaned off the mess, and it was bubbly and lumpy, and the brush resembled toothbrush bristles.  It was impossible to get a nice semi-even coat of polish with this brush.  Then I tried the magnet, thinking, well at least I get a nice magnet from each of these.  Nope... didn't work.  The gold also was clotted and wonky (but not as much) and the brush stiff like a toothbrush, but the magnet worked on that one.  Still not a nice bold star pattern like on the box, but more like thin straight lines.  I don't want to open the other 2 right now because these are very smelly and I'm sensitive to that.  I purchased these a while ago, so it's past my return window, or these would definitely be going back.  The colors were great though.",160,25
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,"Do not buy. I use this brand of nail polish all the time and these are very inferior compared to the norm. They were clumpy, goopy and completely unusable. When I went to request a return it said these items not eligible for a return ... either old or used but either way - don't waste your money.",58,26
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,terrible! one bottle came with the brush bent completely up (unusable). another bottle came with hardly any polish in it at all. my daughter was very disappointed. the other 2 bottles were fine and the magnet does work.,38,27
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,This was part of a gift and she Loved it,10,28
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,1.0,negative,"Horrible! This stuff was crap...the ""magnetic"" properties were a joke. If I could rate it a 0, I would! 2 out of the 4 bottles were a dried out mess of goo.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,"I bought these buttons to add to a cardigan I'm making. They are a good size for women's or children's clothes. There was a sticker on the package that said $2.79, so I'm not sure why they cost a dollar more than that. If you have a good craft store around where you could get  buttons for cheap, you could probably find a comparable product. I bought these online because the local craft store has pretty high prices and these were a better value.",84,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B000RER2JG,4.0,positive,"Great for little projects, especially baby items. There were two different sizes of white, two different sizes of black, and one size of clear. I ordered these not know what size they would be because I didn't see it anywhere on the description. I would order them again.",48,2

If you're careful it works really well to hide damage and to renew older furniture and shoes. Mixing colors is hard, and that's why a lot of people gave bad reviews: Because they didn't mix their colors and got mad that the color didn't match. You have to have the patience and artistic ability/dexterity to REALLY take your time with this, and to test carefully if color matching.

I bought this for black pieces, and the black paint works fine. You just have to be careful not to over-apply, and to wait for the glue layer to dry before applying color.

There simply isn't enough paste to patch.  Once 'patched' the repair material barely sticks, and the texturing process to allow it to blend in is poorly thought out.

I would practice with a color you won't be using on an item you don't care about, to get the hang of it. The directions are a little hard to understand and I had to read them 2 or 3 times to make sure I understood. Careful when applying the grain to get the proper side down.

I'm giving this 2 start because most people would not think to look at the reviews to get the correct instructions, they would simply do as I did and attempt the instructions that came with the product. That won't work at all. If you follow the correct instructions from the Avery site, you'll have a nice outcome with a pretty nice transfer.

Once you know how to apply these, they're actually very nice iron-ons. I've made a few shirts for my 5-year old daughter, who absolutely loves them. I've also transferred images onto bibs for my youngest daughter... amazingly, they've lasted quite a long time. Over several washings, they begin to wrinkle a bit, but as long as you dry them on low, they'll last a while. My wife accidentally dried one shirt on normal and the transfer ended up wrinkling a bit and looked like it had been through a dozen washings. Considering we've bought shirts from stores that have lasted less time, I'm very happy with these.",133,8

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B002NEGT9W,1.0,negative,"As many reviewers have pointed out, the instructions included for this product are ridiculous.  I have tested this product on several white t-shirts (have not done any dark).  The actual use, once I figured it out, was fairly easy.  This was not a problem.  The real problem came in after a few wears and washes.  Of the three shirts I have made, I would say each have been worn and washed 3 or 4 times.  On all but one of them, the image has already started to crack apart and peel.  It could be that I did something wrong.  But, given the abysmal included instructions, I called the help line and followed their directions exactly.

I've only used this on white cotton t-shirts and although it is easy to apply (especially since I don't really care if it ruins our garage sale iron) the images have been breaking apart on the t-shirt material.  Since this is the main reason why I purchased the product the use of it has become null to me.  I'm not willing to shell out more money for nice t-shirts that I'll probably just ruin so these transfers will probably just go in a drawer somewhere in my house, never to be used again.",142,11

I mainly use these to entertain kids (making team 1 & team 2 items), to add to a theme event (bridal shower toss pillow covers) or other random temporary projects.

As with most print-yourself iron-on transfers, the background is slightly shiny and non-stretchable and fades after several vigorous washings.  The item must be removed and lightly rinsed again by hand to avoid colour/print transfer to another part of the t-shirt.  In other words, don't leave the printed shirt sitting wet too long in the machine after washing.  As with items in this genre, this is purely a temporary, ""in the moment,"" item.  For something that lasts, I would recommend using the many professional printing services both online and brick & mortar.

My one major complaint is that the instructions are incorrect.  (Avery put the instructions for a different product in the packing).  Do not peel the transfer off the backing before printing.",168,14

Instead of having t-shirts printed for employees who come and go and mistreat the ones I've bought and had screen-printed, I have often opted to print our logo with these transfers. I think this latest batch I got is slightly more resistant to fading in the washing/drying process. I suppose I'll know better a month or two from now, but so far they seem better. Same good performance as far as ink color accuracy and consistently even transfer of image.

Two months later - the images I printed continue to wear well through the laundry process. The two concerns anyone may have about using these transfers have now both been put to rest for me: the image is intense and evenly printed; the image stays that way much more than it would have with previous editions of the transfer.

After one wearing, I rinsed them both in cold water in the sink, and the ink ran terribly. Nearly all the red just washed right off. Ugh.

After eventually getting this to work I found out that that you cannot dry the fabrics on anything other than low (which is fine with me, I dry everything on low to keep them soft).

Thirdly, when I pointed out that my issue wasn't addressed they stopped respinding to me. As lastly, the smallest hook broke.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00DQNQ5BG,1.0,negative,Arrived timely and good value but several of the hooks are unusable.  The grooves were fused together so the yarn just keeps slipping.

They do have some rough edges, mostly out of yarn's way on the end, but annoying enough to want to sand off. There was no ""plastic wallet/case"" to speak of either, just the hooks.

I must have gotten lucky because shipping was actually pretty quick.

Overall I got what I paid for and expected nothing more.",94,49

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,Seller was good and this item arrived promptly.  BUT... This produce is horrible.  Selected these and paid more money because I thought they were nicer looking.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00FJ4NF0O,1.0,negative,"The good: You can cut these to the size you'd like.

The bad: They would not adhere at all. I tried every single patch that came in this packet, and not one would stick to the fabric. It would stick partially, if at all, and then after cooling would peel right off. I'm a seasoned pro at ironing on patches, and so I feel confident saying that these are simply poor quality. $11 for a handful of patches is bad enough, but $11 for patches that won't even stick is just insulting. I feel like I've been ripped off, frankly, and I don't usually feel that way after purchasing something off Amazon.

I ordered some iron-on patches from another company off Amazon, and those adhered beautifully. These are a scam.",130,8

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00LHVU63W,4.0,positive,"The buttons are vibrant colors and are perfect for making button necklaces, when paired with some painted buttons also sold on Amazon.  The price is very reasonable. The only complaint is you don't get over 50, but I wouldn't want them to decrease the size of the buttons to meet the quantity advertised(to satisfy the 40g weight indicated), so I can accept this issue. The colors are more vibrant than the picture shows. I've ordered more.",76,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,"These slices are pretty and will work fine if you need tiny wood slices. However the pictures are misleading and I think this product is too expensive.  The majority of the slices measure 3 cm, which is the small side of the 3-5 cm quoted. I'd maybe pay $0.20 each, but not $0.33.  The pictures are misleading if you're reading quickly and not reading the fine print. The picture of the slices in a box also shows 3x the quantity you get and makes the slices look a lot bigger than they are. However, if you want this size they would be fine. Just make sure to get out a ruler before ordering and think about what 3 cm really means. Cute for tiny ornaments or kids' crafts.",128,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,1.0,negative,Were supposed to be the 3-5 INCH not cm I had ordered some that size in the same order and wanted bigger ones for a wreath. Very disappointed I wasted my money on these when bigger ones were the same price.,41,34

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00SHL1SE6,2.0,negative,Was under the impression that these round wood slices were coaster size. I planned on woodburning them for my wedding guest. Now they will all get a magnet to put on their fridge. They are about the size of a silver dollar.,42,45

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,1.0,negative,"First off, these are fine tipped markers, not pens. Secondly, I've never experienced drawing with something that doesn't remotely match the color of the cap! It's like a surprise every time. The light colors are dark, the five different greens are all roughly the same color. The yellows are orange or green...and they have run out quickly.
On the plus side, the case is nice and I like the triangular shape, and the price was cheap!",76,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,"The colors are all vibrant. 1 of the markers MAY have had a leak, but after inspecting each and every single one, I couldn't find d it. But oh well, I love them!",33,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,I love these. I wish I had found them sooner! Thy arrived before the date that was given. I use them for school and also for coloring.

I used them only for a school year if that's a while, but some of the colors dry out faster than others. once a pen has been bent or split there's no going back. That was the only sad part about these pens.",54,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,"These are a very nice fine tipped pen. Work wonderfully in those small areas for coloring in. There are plenty of colors , but I did notice that 1 of the oranges has more of a red tint to it when put on paper. there was only 1 pen that I had any issue with and it was a light green which didn't bother me that much since I don't use a lot of the lighter green colors. But by running the barrel under hot water seemed to let the color ""drop"" and I haven't had any issue since. the colors do not bleed through if the paper is a heavier weight, but with a lighter weight paper there is some bleed thru so you may want to put a blotter paper behind any work you are doing.  The colors are vibrant and they do come in a very nice heavy plastic case so you won't lose them anywhere. I am attaching a copy of a picture that I am working on right now , using these pens for the linework , the wording is done with a marker.
I received these markers at a reduced price for a fair and honest review.",203,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,5.0,positive,I bought these to use for adult coloring books. And a lot of people end up using colored pencils but I wanted something a lot more vibrant and these really did the trick. Is a great variety of colors and it's very sharp clear bright pigmentation. I'd recommend this to anybod. so far none of them have really been drying out or anything like that and the best part about it is you can really get into those cute little nooks and crannies within your coloring book. I'm not sure if this company makes a wider tip variety of this pain but if they do I'll probably buy it overall great colors and not a lot of bleeding through the paper,121,23

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,"These are nice pens. Very fine point. They are great for tiny details. However, they do not blend well.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,2.0,negative,Unfortunately these claimed to be gel pens when I purchased them.  They were not.  They are fine point markers.

I've only had one marker leak since I've begun using them.
They're excellent for mixed media projects, mandala colorings, Zen tangle, journaling, deconstructing books, grocery lists.
I would not recommend them for huffing nor would they assist you in mentally cleaning out your fridge.
That is all.",77,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00VZXL83O,4.0,positive,I use these for coloring and they are great products. The only down side is that the ink dries out a little too quickly so I have to tap the pen and move the ink around to help the flow.,40,43

Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,"This installs easily on the Rigid vacuum exhaust port, but that's about the only good thing about it.  It is just a tube with a loose mesh at the end of it.  I could not detect any difference in volume of the vacuum whether this thing was installed or not.  It's a good idea, but really doesn't work too well.",60,3
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,"This product being advertised as a 'muffler' is misleading. I observed no difference in sound level.  I just completed my test.  It is being returned.  An effective way to reduce the noise level and redirect the exhaust is to put a second hose on the exhaust side of the vac.  This is a viable option for my use, since I will keep it in a semi-permanent location in my workshop and reducing noise was my primary objective.",77,4
Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,The listing for this muffler doesn't say what size hose it fits.  There are three sizes.  When I received it I realized it didn't fit my vacuum.,27,5
Automotive,B0000302TY,2.0,negative,"My Ridgid shopvac puts out a startling 106dB at 3 feet.  According to my meter this is the equivalent of taking a crying baby to a Dead Kennedys concert.

The ""muffler"" reduces that to 105--so maybe a Wolfmother concert and a very upset toddler. Further, using an unscientific ""stick to your face"" test, I'd say it reduces suction by about 15%.

So basically what this thing does is keep the air from blasting out the back of your vac.  If you need that (and don't want to just tape a sock to the outlet) click ""buy"" immediately.

I finally just broke down and put my vac in a soundproofed cabinet.  Now I can hear my wife when she buzzes the house in her F-16.",124,6

PS This site won't allow my 'zero star' rating.",45,8
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,This not only helps to make the sound quieter but it helps so that the machine doesn't blow air all over from the back of the machine!  It is a great addition for very little money.  We were super excited to get it as a gift off our wish list.,50,9
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,"I was surprised to see that this 'muffler' received 4 stars. When I read the reviews, praise was given not because it muffles sound, but because it diffuses the rather powerful exhaust. Indeed, this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my Ridgid vacs. (I bought two of them, but I was in a rush and got them locally.)

When we are working on a job site, there often is lots of dust. Imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place. Not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in, it also spreads the dust over an even greater area. As other reviewers describe, this 'muffler' -- oh, why not just call it 'air-diffuser' -- redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle. This greatly reduces the force of the air.

It is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler, but the difference is too small to spend any money on. So in terms of living up to its name, I give it one star.",190,10
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,This little contraption works like magic for reducing the irritable air flow that comes out of the blower port of most shopvac.  The name is rather misleading as it wasn't designed nor does it do any thing for noise reduction.,40,11
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,"If you are looking for sound reduction you are looking in the wrong place. If you want to limit how far your canister vac can blow exhaust, this is what you need. It can be easily installed or removed and eliminates all forceful exhaust.",44,12
Automotive,B0000302TY,1.0,negative,"This is definitely not a noise muffler. It's not a silencer either. It does change the airflow from straight out in one direction at your knees to many directions that include your face. By redirecting the air it just makes more it unpredictable. I bought this for our new Ridgid WD1680, which Amazon doesn't sell. The big box store I bought it from noted it was 10/10 in loudness so I got this to go with it. Used in a garage, the vac is surprisingly quiet. It seems our Hoover upright is much louder. I measured the Ridgid as-is at 83dB. With the 'muffler' on, it was 83dB. There was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant. I figure it's also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I'm going to return it. The WD1680 also works as a removeable blower. In that configuration it blew everything around much worse than the unmuffled exhaust port, even though it was the same port with just a tube attachment. So bottom line is that this is useless.",182,13
Automotive,B0000302TY,5.0,positive,"Worth buying to prevent the massive exhaust from blowing your house apart.  This really tames to exhaust flow by directing it in a 360 degree pattern, and also diffusing it with some very porous foam.  Vacuum performance is not hindered.

It's not really a ""muffler"" as the noise level did not change for me, but controlling the massive amount of exhaust was my reason for buying.  It should really come with the vacuum, but since it doesn't, it's a no brainer purchase.",82,14
Automotive,B0000302TY,4.0,positive,"I bought this item for the Rigid shop vac with detachable blower(basically the same unit as the Sears Craftsman version).  It makes a noticable difference in reducing the FREQUENCY of the sound, thus eliminating the higher pitched whine that you get without the unit.  Although I can't say for sure that it makes the overall sound quieter( I don't have a dB meter), it certainly makes it seem quieter and MUCH more bearable.  You do have to watch where you point it though because it will shoot a blast of air in that direction (although this is by design, it is the blower port after all.  Also it not fully inserted, it my be shot out by the rush of air when you first turn it on.  Worth the money!",130,15

Automotive,B000CMFSY4,2.0,negative,"Update- I contacted Husky about these mats and the poor fit in my toyota highlander. Outstanding customer service. Engineer admitted these are more of a general purpose mat and not specifically designed for one model of vehicle. Instead, he shipped me the ""cargo liner"" mats which are custom molded to cover the entire floor in front of the driver and passenger. The custom fit liners are FAR better . If you drive a highlander or larger vehicle, choose the custom liner and skip this mat.

(Original review) I drive a 2006 highlander and was happy to see that my specific model was listed. Unfortunately, these floor mats are anything but vehicle specific. The Husky website tells you that they will require ""trimming"" and even after doing so, the driver side mat does not fit correctly. This is a safety hazard and I strongly recommend against this product. Save your monay and shop elsewhere.",153,11
Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,"WeatherTech makes the Digital fit for the 2004 Tacoma, but NOT the double cab. I bought those mats from amazon because their fit guide said it would work. When they didn't sit right, I went to their Weathertech's site and learned that they don't make the mats for the double cab truck. You can submit a product request on that site, and tell them you want that this mat made. Once there are enough requests, they'll make it.
If you are buying these mats because you don't want to spend the $100+ that Weathertech charges, then you may be satisfied. If you've ever owned the WT mats, these are no where near the fit. Since they were 60% of the cost of the WT mats, I'm not disappointed.",128,12

Automotive,B000CMFSY4,4.0,positive,"I've had several Husky heavy duty floor mats in the past.  I prefer the Heavy duty to the Hskey liners in the front as they are less slippery and thicker.  Normally they fit great and last forever.  I bought this set for my 2004 Tacoma Double cab (1st Gen).  The fit leaves something to be desired.  Initially the driver's side was terrible, but there are pattern lines for trimming it down.  After trimming with a razor, it's a good fit.  I'm not sure if this is for multiple models, but I would prefer a fit out of the box.  The passenger side needs to be molded differently on the bottom left corner, as it comes up over a bump in the floorboard.

Colour is great match.  Materials quality is great, and I'm sure they will last as long as my other Husky's have.  Just a bit disappointed in the passenger side fit.  It's not terrible by any means, but not perfect as others have been.  Driver side is perfect after trimming with a razor blade along the trim lines.",179,21
Automotive,B000FQ033I,5.0,positive,"After hitting some ice and tearing up my front fender I decided to buy these to cover the damage. They worked great and fit like a glove. No sweat on the tape... I just used clear silicone via caulk gun to attach. Nothing to it. One thing to note... these attach behind the front running lights via screws. In other words, you remove your front running lights, then replace atop the fender covers back to the holes. The screws in the kit were just a little short and not really up to the task. I went to the auto store and purchased some stainless #8 screws with plenty of length to tighten up everything.

These look great on the jeep. I also have real diamond plate installed and the guards matches just fine!",133,0
Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,"If you buy these, you WILL need to trim these and take your time to make them fit correctly. I had to use a Dremel to shave down the sides for both sides to sit flush. Then, I had to use a heat gun to heat them up and mold them to the fenders so they would sit right.

Go to Lowes or Home Depot and buy stainless steel screws. The ones they provide will not work correctly. You will want to use a pan head screw. Head size #8 and 1"" long.

Go to your local auto parts store and pick up a small roll of 3M double sided tape (has a red backing and the adhesive is a dark gray). The provided tape won't be enough to hold it down right.

Overall; not a terrible product, but for a $50 molded piece of plastic, I would have expected it to fit better.",154,1
Automotive,B000FQ033I,4.0,positive,"The front is much easier than the back. Lights come out easily and the fit is pretty good.
I read a review that said it didn't come with new screws and the ones you take out of your lights aren't long enough. I didn't see any when looking at the parts so I went and bought some but later when cleaning up, I found a little bag with 4 black screws in it and taped to another bag the parts came in. Never saw that. lol  I assume these were for that but I did the front and backs at the same time so can't swear to it.

Automotive,B000FQ033I,2.0,negative,"These guards look great in the pictures but for the money they are way over priced.  Here is a list of things that could be improved on these that I created while installing these.

1.  Better tape.  I'm not sure why Rugged Ridge skimped on the tape for these but after installing the left gard as per the instructions it literally popped off.  I went down to Kragen and got the best 3m tape they had and the guard fits flush just fine.

2.  Quality control.  For 50 plus dollars I would consider these a disappointment.  The plastic was unevenly cut was thin in some areas particularly where the screrws go.  The mold might have been crooked because the screw holes were also a little uneven.

3.  Heavier duty.  I know plastic is very strong but I was definitely disappointed with the weight and feel of the plastic as well considering the price.  For 20 dollars I doubt I would have said anything but for triple that and more on other websites I was pretty annoyed.  Definitely considered returning them

Automotive,B000H0RCTK,2.0,negative,"I'll start by explaining that I have a 2009 Toyota Corolla and was looking to upgrade to an HID system.  These cars have two sets of headlights.  There is a dedicated low beam set and a driving/high beam set.  I got the low beam switched out pretty easy with 9006 8000K single beam HID system.  I looked up the type of bulb for the driving/ high beam set and it was 9005. So I ordered a 9005 HID SYSTEM thinking it would be an easy swap like the low beams. Nope..... after installing that system...  they flickered... And didn't get bright for the high beams.  After further investigation I discovered that Toyota is using a voltage change to achieve the difference in brightness. Obviously this will not work for HID. So then I decided to find a ""white"" as possible halogen bulb. Well... when I got these bulbs I was under the impression that they would be whiter and or brighter than stock. Don't let the blue color of the bulbs fool you.  They not only don't shine blue, they don't even act like they are closer to cool white than stock.  Now.... they are brighter.... but not whiter.  Kinda disappointed.",201,9

I took the o-ring off the old bulbs and put them on the new ones. They fit right in now. 1 star off for that. Would have been more if I didn't solve it.

Automotive,B000H0RCTK,5.0,positive,"Halogen lights will always be yellowish.  Tried Sylvania Ultra (4100k) and PIAA Xtreme (4100k)...these are very bright.  They may look ""white"" if you are staring directly at the blazing bulb; but the light cast on the road is distintively a halogen yellow.  If you have an HID low-beam but do not want a yellow high-beam, then this is a good light.  Used on a 2001 X4 with factory 4300k HID.  The bulb has a royal blue bulb that ""changes"" the yellow to a white light (about 5000k); just barely a hint of blue compared to the factory HID.  Any halogen that attempts to change the color towards HID will compromise brightness.  This was acceptable to me since I rarely use my high-beam to flash other drivers.",126,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,"Bought this for my central AC unit outside that had a lot of mashed spots. There were no instructions on how to use this or put it together so I had to youtube it, it looked 'easy' the way the guy just combed through the fins but when you actually go to do this, unless your fins are only slightly askew, you're going to get stuck.

I ended up just sitting there using the comb for over an hour on the spots and eventually noticed that the individual combs started to break or get bent. It's plastic, and not very sturdy plastic at that. After losing 3 prongs I just ended up getting a small thin blade and using the flat side to coax the dents out. Worked better than this fin straightener.

Pros:
-Well...it works for a bit.

Cons
-cheap plastic

Bottom line: If the fins you're trying to fix are only slightly out of shape, then this would be easy to use. But if you got some big dents and a lot of them, you should look for one that has metal prongs. (Or just get thin sturdy blade and spend a bit more time and patience).",199,0

Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,As this was a replacement for a lost tool it matched perfectly,12,18
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,"I suppose this worked about as good as could be expected, but it didn't get the job done before the the teeth started breaking.

About the only method that seems to work is picking them back up one by one with a grapefruit knife!",62,19

Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,"Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly fit most of the gauges on my condensers.  I bought this to improve the air flow of my window air conditioner units.  Probably not really the fault of the product.  I'd lay more blame on the A/C Mfg.  A decently made product for a difficult job.",50,21
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,"This tool just filled the bill for straighting out condenser fins as it has many different sizes for the bill, and I have been able to use it more than a few times and it keeps on working",38,22
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,Do not waste your  money. It was totally broken in less than 5 mminutes.  Very poor product. Should be removed from this site.,23,23

Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,"A couple of old window ac units given to me had dented fins, this straightened them out so they run more efficient.",22,27
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,Does not have a smaller separation setting for most A/C fins. The insertion end could be more pointed to ease getting in between the fins.  Handle angle is awkard when trying to straightened the fins.,35,28
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,As other reviews; doesn't fit and I measured. really not sure what to do with it now. Wondering if they will take it back?,24,29
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,Does what we bought it for. It is light weight and very compact. It is perfect for our RV air conditioner.,21,30
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,"I bought this tool because the fins on my A/C were completely bent and mangled.  It was starting to affect the performance of my unit.  I was quoted several hundred dollars to get this fixed by a professional.  Instead, I picked up this tool.  It does support several different units since it has heads for different numbers of fins per inch.  I was able to use this tool and spend about 30 minutes to fix the fins on my unit.

I am rating this only four stars because this is not the best quality.  For only a few uses it is wonderful, but a professional would never want to use this tool because I couldn't imagine it lasting with that much abuse.",122,31
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,"During the first minute of use, the fins in the #12 broke off.  Poorly made, plastic fins are too brittle.",20,32

I found success by using a razor knife, which is a tedious process, though.  I'd return it but after the postage my refund wouldn't make it worth it, so I'll just put it with all the other tools I have have no use for.  It doesn't come with instructions, which was disappointing even if it's supposed to be obvious what a guy's supposed to do.",103,33
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,I have four different-sized window AC units and none of the sizes on the tool fit the fins on any of them. I have no idea if it works or not. It's too much of a hassle to send it back to Amazon. So for me the tool was a waste of money. I wished I had bought this tool from a local store so I could just return it. I guess you live and learn.,76,34
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,One of the tines on the '15' side is bent making it nearly impossible to insert into the radiator grill.,20,35
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,The white plastic part has way too many irregularities.  I was not able to straighten out my AC condenser.  It's easier to take a knife and run it down the condenser and straighten out the fins.,36,36
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,"This tool is destined for the finest garbage pails you can find. It doesn't work, it's flimsy, and I think a rubic's cube is easier to figure out.

Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,"This tool WORKS, but you might want to buy 3 or 4 of them since the plastic teeth break after a few pulls through the fins. I had to resort to dragging the tool sideways across the bent fins to straighten them after a few of the teeth broke. A tool like this with either high-impact plastic or metal teeth would work much better.

If it helps, I have a Coleman-Evcon heat pump/AC unit and the 14 count teeth worked well on my fins, until they broke of course.",89,38
Automotive,B000M5WT16,1.0,negative,Anazon is a good place to buy. This tool is almost useless for what it is made for. There has to be a better tool for this.,27,39
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,After getting a little carried away with the power washer I was forced to buy one of these.  Worked well for all but the very edge where our AC unit has a 1 inch metal frame that got in the way of the tool.,44,40
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,"I used this on a very large 4' x 3' refrigeration condenser which every square inch had been severely damaged by hail.  The entire job took me a good 5 hours and required a great deal of patience and a little WD-40. This little tool worked beautifully and proved itself tough and versatile.  Not one tooth on this tool was damaged or broken.  Thanks to this little tool, my refrigeration unit has been completely restored saving me a tremendous amount of money for replacement.",84,41
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,"Great price, and made with quality red handle.....The white plastic comb is  not made to specs. the comb teeth are spaced right but the comb teeth are too wide, you will have to use sandpaper to make this product work. I also had three of the six combs with another problem. The teeth of these combs were either bent too far outward or inward, and there was no way to correct the problem. I think it is a great design, but maybe if it was made with a better process and too more ridged specs it could be worth the money and the time. If you need an item like this, keep searching for a better made product.",118,42
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,"I have a whirlpool window unit that is about five years old. This worked just great for it. I need to try it on my other unit now, but I was impressed with the simplicity. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the plastic tines look they won't have much longevity. Very happy with this purchase.",60,43
Automotive,B000M5WT16,4.0,positive,"Unfortunately, this would not straighten out the fins on my A/C unit.  I just couldn't get any section to fit.  Well built and nicely priced if you can get it to work.",32,44
Automotive,B000M5WT16,2.0,negative,"This didn't work for my air conditioner.  Before ordering this product, get a ruler and measure how many fins per inch on your unit.  This product is designed to straighten them if they're 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 or 15 fins per inch (mine's 20).",45,45
Automotive,B000M5WT16,5.0,positive,"It just took me a few minutes to perfect my technique using this tool and after that, my air conditioner fins look like new again.  I wish I could measure the efficiency improvement, but by looks alone it is 100% better.",41,46
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,I love this seat cover- comfortable and feels great on my back. Get yours now!,15,0
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,I have it for both my car and my office. They work great and the beads increase circulation which increases male performance. After the car has been sitting in the sun all day the seats cool off faster than the steering wheel. No need for expensive ventilated seats like Amerigon. My back and behind are less sweaty. The beads also relieve my back pain. In the office I get laughed at but it's better than having a loud desk fan to cool you off and my shirts are sweat stain free. I wish they made this in black or dark brown because the light color does not match my seats.,110,1
Automotive,B000ML80V8,1.0,negative,Not happy with the product. After using the seat for two days the seams came apart. After contacting the company I received a full refund without having to return the item.,31,2

I spend most of the day in front of two computers so when the temperatures in Southern California go up the leather ceases to be comfortable ..  for me.  So I purchase this seat from Amazon.  I have used it everyday for the last 2 months and it is very comfortable.  Infact I'm sitting on it NOW.
Quality seems good so far, I don't expect to have to replace it for quite a while.",82,5
Automotive,B000ML80V8,5.0,positive,"I was worried the first time I tried this beaded seat cover.  It was stiff and hard.  After fifteen minutes it became uncomfortable.  But like new pair of shoes it is very comfortable after being broke in.  It keeps my back from sweating so much and feels nice to sit on.

One thing.  The band to hold the back to the seat is just barely big enough to go around my seat.  I don't have anything to hook the loops on the bottom part to, but that's not a problem for me.  I think I would work well enough just sitting unsecured in the seat.

It's solidly constructed I'm 200lbs and have been driving on it for two weeks and can't see any signs of wear or breakage.

UPDATE: I use these in the summer time.  They stay in the back seat during the winter.  After two summers of sitting on one, it fell apart.  I noticed it tearing one day and a week later it was falling apart all over.",171,6

Automotive,B000ML80V8,4.0,positive,"I love bead seats...used them since the 70s when I heard that cab drivers in NYC used them. The seat part more important than the back rest, at least for me. My dogs tore up the back anyway. Beads are sewed on well I guess because haven't lost a bead yet! Car mfrs don't seem to use a variety of 'bums"" to design seats. So we have to find something to make them fit our bums better.",77,8

Automotive,B000ML80V8,2.0,negative,"These seemed like a great thing and were cooling to sit upon. However, the ""rattan"" is made of some material (possibly nylon) that breaks down extremely quickly in our intense southern sun.

After about 1 months' use, the woven edging surrounding the beads began to deteriorate, and shed pieces everywhere :-(  I swapped passenger <=> driver covers, and made it through the summer before the second one similarly deteriorated, shed, and generally fell apart (only the outer surrounding woven edge fell apart, not the center bead area).

Previously, I had used the larger bead-only covers, and they lasted several years (until the fishing-line string for the bead began breaking).  I had hoped for longer life from these covers.  I'm a pretty careful person, and at 6'0"" and 175lbs, I don't think I'm ""oversize"" for this product.

Refill, install adapter,..pump to 5 psi,..adjust as required to hold pressure..Bleed brake furtherest from MC..(rear pass side ?).. use care not to completely drain MC....break seal, refill MC and repeat...took 30 mins to do all 4 wheels taking my time.didn't spill a drop...When I did this job 1 year ago,..I put brake fluid in the bleeder and it leaked at the MC despite passing an initial pressure leak check.

Since it is a universal cap, it doesn't seal 100%; the metal chain that goes around the brake and clutch fluid reservoir to create the seal works but the reservoirs aren't perfectly flat on the bottom to prevent the chain from moving.  Therefore, the chain can move loosening the tension and breaking the seal.  I would recommend to either pump the brake and clutch pedals the old fashion way to get an actual cap for the vehicle you're working on to make sure there's an appropriate seal.

I could not find a ""Black Label"", i.e. metal instead of plastic, for the universal adapter. Problem is the cap is not rigid enough to hold pressure. First time I use it, leak all over the floor. Since I could not found any metal universal adapter, I used a rectangle piece of 1/2 inch thick PlexiGlass and drilled 3 holes for the center hose and the two J-screws.  Materials and labor from Tap Plastic cost around $8. Slide the PlexiGlass on top of the cap and tight the J-screw, worked the first time.

Not to mention the fact that with this cup holder on, you can literally forget about using the emergency brake again. You won't be able to reach it (if a bottle or a coffee cup are sitting in it) and the brake will not pull all the way!

Automotive,B001EMSPW8,4.0,positive,"This is an excellent product.  It's easy to install, took only minutes to install, still allows me to use my emergency brake, and looks like it came from the factory.  It holds a 12 oz can or a small drink from McDonalds perfectly.  And that's the problem.

A 20 oz drink bottle, most medium drinks, my Eco Canteen, and EVERY large drink will simply not fit.  You know those plastic cups they have at 711, Quick Trip and Arby's that get smaller at the bottom to help them fit into older cupholders?  Well, they fit this .... almost.  You can shove it down a bit and it will stand up when you're sitting still, but if you don't keep a hand on it, it will definitely fall over under even mild acceleration or cornering.

Still, this is better than no cupholder at all.  Some time ago, I saw a cupholder that fit into these small ones that held bigger drinks.  I found the Kaz e Kup ([...]), which is sort of like what I remember seeing.  If I can't find anything better, I will definitely order that.

If your parking brake takes more then ""3 clicks"" to hold the back brakes you will be lifting up the holder.

I even got a great deal though the Amazon Warehouse deals.  It said it was used, but the only thing I saw that was slightly off was the box (wrinkled and shelf worn)!  The Weathertech product was in new condition and it installed with no problem whatsoever.

Functionally you can drive with your windows down to the level of the deflector or slightly lower and not get that huge rush of wind and attendant noise that comes with it.  You can also leave your windows cracked open so the heat escapes when it is parked and to everyone else from the outside it looks like the windows are up (dark tint).",128,7
Automotive,B001GS0DAC,1.0,negative,"The front deflectors fit well but they tend to rattle when the wind hits them just right. The rear deflectors are terrible since they do not prevent water from entering in a 2010 Honda CR-V. The problem is the Honda rear window design is not suited for rain deflectors. I left the rear window deflectors in however since Weather Tech would not offer my installer a partial refund. Note that the metal clips that are used on the rear deflectors have permanently damaged the rubber trim on the windows. Be careful how you install them so you don't bend the rubber window trim.

Eventually the rear deflectors kept coming loose and kept falling off so I eventually removed them. Bottom line: I recommend that you don't buy the rear deflectors on a Honda CR-V.

Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,"I thought this would look nicer than an aluminum one. The adhesive is very cheap, it won't support my mic and fell off after about 60 seconds. Certainly wouldn't hold up off road. Might work better with some quality 3m adhesive strips.",42,46
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,"I bought this for my jeep, a few warm summer days and the adhesive backing gives way with out any weight on it.  I keep my mic in the glove box while not in use so the mount has only its weight and it still falls.",46,47

Automotive,B001JT0L46,1.0,negative,"I'm recommending against this holder.  Back in the old'en days, you could almost never count on backing-adhesives doing the job, but I've been surprised over the years how much better those products have become.  Unfortunately, this product does not exhibit those improved characteristics.  Even though I carefully cleaned the surface to which this product would adhere the adhesive failed hold almost instantly.  The adhesive fell apart at two points.  Amazon did refund my account.  Also, this item should have costs 49 cents, not $3.79; it's just a tiny piece of plastic.",91,49
Automotive,B001JT0L46,2.0,negative,The self stick tape lasted less than one hour in my car before this thing fell off of the dash. To make it works I had to by a better double back tape.,33,50
Automotive,B001JT0L46,4.0,positive,"Perfect fit for a typical CB handset, but will require either a screw or some real tape. The surface material included is just plain poor. I ultimately just drilled a small screw into my dash. Works perfect.",37,51

Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,"I lost my CB radio mic mount so I bought this one. I read the reviews saying that the adhesive is weak. No problem, right away I tore off the old adhesive tape and replaced it with Scotch Extreme Mounting Tape which claims to hold 20 lbs (got it at Home Depot). The tape is insanely strong. I used to have my mic velcro'd to my dash and so I would always pull it straight off. I've accidentally tried doing that several times with this mount (instead of pulling up first) and it has held with no problems. Good stuff.",100,53
Automotive,B001JT0L46,5.0,positive,The adhesive is very strong and can withstand the excessive use my little sister puts on it when she rides with me. I really can't complain. Looks nice in black interior of vehicle as well.,35,54

Automotive,B001PHY8HS,5.0,positive,I bought a Glowshift transmission temperature gauge and later bought this pillar pod as an after thought. It worked great fit like a glove on my 91 Ford Explorer pillar post. After painting it to make the colour of the interior it looks like it was factor OEM. A trick I learned is to heat up the pod with a blow dryer then form it to fit the pillar screw it into place and let it cool down. then remove and paint to match works like a charm.,88,2

Automotive,B001PHY8HS,1.0,negative,"How this worthless frankenpod can be described as ""universal"" is a mystery to me.

I bought one for my Suburban and there is NO WAY - repeat, NO WAY - this thing can come anywhere near close to being made to fit the pillar.

I frankly can't imagine it fitting anything short of a piece of heavy earth-moving equipment such as a bulldozer or the like.

It's just one of those things I wrote off to experience.  Can't win them all.

Good luck getting any use out of it if you have the misfortune to buy one.",97,10

Automotive,B001TLITTI,2.0,negative,the seat covers were very nice looking I got plenty complaints but they do not last long they tear up not good material at all!!!!!!!!,25,1
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,I like these seat covers a lot. I mainly got them to protect my light covered seats. I didn't really care for the colors. But they are very useful. The only thing I don't really like is that you have cut holes for the covers that go in the back for the seat belts.,54,2
Automotive,B001TLITTI,5.0,positive,Awesome. Totally transformed the look of my car. Tight fit.,10,3
Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,"Descriptions were for Lexus-LS430 (2006) but when I received the cover they are too small, spend money to go to car dealer who were not able to put seats on  also none of the covers had accommodating opening for my cay feafures",42,4

Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,"Bought these for my niece and they are of good quality.  Back seat covers harder to get on but that is the norm.

Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,These seat lovers are nice enough but the problem is that the backseat covers do not fit a 2014 Toyota Camry. This Camry has airbags in the rear that should not be covered.,33,8
Automotive,B001TLITTI,4.0,positive,These seat covers are pretty darn cool actually.  It was not that difficult to install at all.  The only complain is that it doesn't quite fit my back seats. There is no opening in the seat cover for the center consul of the back seat.,45,9

Automotive,B001TLITTI,1.0,negative,"Even being extremely careful & following exact instructions (which are lacking greatly in detail), they've ripped twice, first set & then the replacement set & the 2nd set the primary strap that holds it in place broke.  Great look, great price, but being gentle & careful when installing.  I would not buy again.",53,12
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,"When used with the included sticky rubber mat, this holder securely holds my iPhone or Garmin Nuvi GPS.  The dashboard on my Honda Odyssey has a nice flat spot that it can sit very stable.  The material of the holder is a foam so it will not damage your electronics and you can easily squish it into your glove box, too.  The stickiness of the rubbery mat is a downfall as it attracts dust and dirt.  If you'd like to see additional pics of this holder, please see the ones I posted in the photos section.",96,0
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,"Whether this works for you depends largely on what type of car you drive. It seems to work better in my car than in my husband's, but the dashboards are totally different. Even in my car, I did have some trouble with this falling when I accelerated quickly or took a sharp turn. Also, it really isn't an attractive device in any way, but when it works, it gets the job done. People may want to try something like this before getting one of the mounts you need to attach or suction-cup to your window.",95,1
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,"This was a decent product. It sits on the dashboard and holds a portable GPS. It allows your hands to be free for driving. I find it handier for holding an ipod than a GPS. On the negative side, its a large block of foam sitting on the dashboard, which I don't like. But if that kind of thing doesn't bother you, go for it! There are several well-placed holes for running cords through. It also came with a sticky pad for the dashboard to keep things from sliding.",89,2
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,"I was truly hoping this might be a viable solution when traveling through states which do not allow for windshield-mounted gps units. (I have tried vent-mounts previously with relative success, but found turning corners to be an issue when the vent-mount would swing away from view.)

The concept of the CommuteMate NavCup is a good one; the execution of the concept, however, is poor.

First, the cradle will accomodate only the thinnest of gps units, which rules out the use of my Navigon GPS.

Second, in spite of power cord ""cut outs"" in the cradle for routing the cord, they will not accomodate a standard length micro USB jack in the bottom of one of my gps units... to say nothing of the offset micro USB jack on a secondary GPS unit I own.

The cost of return shipping does not make it cost effective to return, so perhaps my review will spare another from making an unnecessary purchase.

I think if Heininger Holdings would redesign the cradle, they may have a good product. On a positive note, the DashGrip mat that came with it should be useful for securing loose items on my center console.",196,3
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,Would not stay on dashboard.  Ended up using them in the home for my IPhone 4,16,4
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,this product was ok but its very light and when you make right or left turns in the car it slides off the dashboard to easy when you make a turn have to hold it or it won't stay,39,5
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,"Navi-cup does what it is designed to do--put your GPS where you can see, but not in your line of sight on the windshield.",24,6
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,"fine for the GPS but the iphone falls out.  Fast delivery, would order again .",15,7
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,I love it.  It makes it very easy to see my GPS and it does not move or slide around.,20,8
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,"Do not like the product at all!  First it does not fit on the dash of
our car and second it falls overtime there is a somewhat sudden
stop.",29,9
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,"This holds my GPS and other things, very well.  No problem traveling and handling the portable GPS unit anymore.
May be expensive for some, but it is worth it to not have to pick the GPS off the floor everytime you make a turn.  The holder keeps it stable.",49,10
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,"I just received my NavCup yesterday and I am very happy with the ease of use; the simplicity of design; and the visibility of my GPS unit while sitting in the holder.  I wish I had one of these years ago instead of the suction cup method I had been using.

With the suction cup I had to permanently attach a plate to the surface of my dash; not good if you ever want to switch to a different GPS unit. Also, the GPS unit always seemed crooked while being held by the suction cup holder.

With the NavCup, my GPS unit sits perfectly straight.  I am not familiar with the durability of the sticky pad, but if it continues to be just as sticky I just don't see any reason not to give the product a heart felt 5 star rating.  I love everything about it.",147,11
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,Not thrilled.  The GPS did not fit well so I am not using it. the cord was in the way so it did not lay correctly.,26,12
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,So happy to find a way to support/display the GPS without it being stuck on windshield. Stable yet removable if needed.  Made of foam but sturdy.,26,13
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,"I was skeptical about buying this but it has actually worked a lot better than I had anticipated.
You do need the sticky dash mat to go between this and your dashboard to keep it in one place.
It is worth more than its price...",45,14
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,"This item does not do what it professes to do, hold your GPS unit. It's made of cheap rubber, the cavity isn't deep enough to hold GPS, it has to be glued to the dash, etc., etc. DO NOT BUY. I have an extra one. Pay shipping and i'll send it to you free.",54,15
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,1.0,negative,"The Heininger 1040 CommuteMate Black NavCup presents the following problem.  I own two portable 5"" screen GPS's.

Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,"I thought it looks nice and might even stay, but after five minutes of driving around, next left turn I took, my GPS was out on the passenger seat.
If only I can keep it on the dash... the rest is fine - I can route the power cable from behind through one of several holes in the back and the GPS does sit on the mount cleanly.
Now I have to put, may be, a velcro to keep this on the dash.
The sticky mat that is supplied with the product also didn't work well on my Camry Sedan, and couldn't keep the NavCup in place for too long.",110,17
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,"It had a tendency to slip off the dash during sudden acceleration. Also, the cable of my Garmin 1490 interfered with Navcup, causing the Garmin to rest crookedly in the Navcup.",31,18
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,I have to say I am very happy with the addition of the NavCup to our Jeep. There is no dash sliding as I take those turns a little too fast and it does not take up too much room. Would definitely recommend this.,44,19
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,2.0,negative,"I was excited to get this item because it seemed like it would do a better job than the traditional suction cup method.  However after one day out in the sunlight, I was left severely disappointed.

The essential problem with the item comes down to the fact it is not adjustable.  It convienently fit our Tomtom and sat sturdily on our dashboard (A RAV4).  It was when we pulled out of our driveway that we realized it sat too far back and you could hardly see it with the glare.  Our particular model of RAV has the dashboard swoop up in the center where you would put such an item.  This made it unreadable.

If your car is different and has a flat dashboard you may have better luck.  For us though?  It was pretty useless in the sunshine.",139,20
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,I have been looking for a holder that would allow me to access my touch screen. The dashboard models are difficult to reach. This really does the trick!,28,21
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,5.0,positive,"There's nothing to using this tool out of the box. Unpack, place the sticky pad on the dash, put the ""Navcup"" on it and you're off to the races.

I live in a mountainous area with lots of inclines and downgrades and turns. In all the time I've been using the NavCup, my Motorola Droid has never slipped out in any direction. The GPS, which is quite a bit larger than the Droid also has never slipped out regardless of speed or direction of travel. Everything stays in place as if it were glued on!

Bear in mind that this is during the height of winter and everything in the car is cold. I wonder what it will be like during summer?

Highly recommended (for now).

UPDATE (05/17/2012): Lo these many years and this thing continues operating very well. The heat didn't faze it one bit. The rubber mat is accumulating dust rather quickly now and so requires a good clean from time to time, otherwise spot on. Upgrading to a five-star review, it deserves it.",176,22

We put our in the console area down below and it works just fine.

Pros:

 + Keeps the phone upright (we use our phone with GPS for navigation)
 + Has a spot where you can place the charging cable through

Cons:

 - Too bulky and light to place on the dash without concerns of it falling off
 - The stickypad that comes with it is very sticky, and I don't want it leaving a residue on the dash
 - Wish it didn't hold the phone/GPS so upright since we use it down in the console area, it'd be great if it were angled back a little bit.",137,23

I've decided to try the CommuteMate NavCup GPS Dash Mount Holder. While it was clearly not designed to hold the rather unique shape of the iPhone when in the TomTom car mount, it does the job.

It does, on occasion, come tumbling down - but for the most part stays in place and I'm pleased.",100,24

Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,"Looking for a stable holder for your GPS device? This is the thing for you! I've got a Tom-Tom GPS system and I was very pleased at how well this worked with it. It held it in place firmly, but was it was still easy to remove. There's also a hold to allow your power cord to go through so you can have it plugged into your car lighter (like anyone uses those for their intended purpose anymore). The holder itself is made out of a black foam substance and sits easily on the dashboard.

Really there's not much more that I can say about this thing. It's sturdy and it gets the job done!",115,26
Automotive,B001XCBDU0,4.0,positive,"I am not a short person, but when my GPS is mounted to the windshield of my SUV, I do have to lean way forward in my seatbelt to change anything on the screen. The NavCup puts the GPS within easy reach of the driver and lowers it out of your line of vision. [which could be a good or bad thing, depending on your preferences and level of distraction. Often, when at eye level, drivers find themselves watching the screen rather than the road.] In the event of a wreck, the GPS unit may go flying as it is not secured beyond its power cable, but the soft NavCup will not cause harm to passengers. The pad mounts easy - just slap it down and sit the cup on it.",131,27

The 14'2"" size fits 09 Solstice Coupe fairly well, wraps down to cover about 75% of the wheels even. Elastic band makes it tricky to put on a slippery waxed car for one person. Keeps dust out nicely, and some oil that dripped on it from my garage door hardware didn't penetrate. Interesting texture ...feels finely woven, with a light plastic/teflon film coating. Light, strong, but not quite what I'd call soft or velvety. No experience with rain or wind yet, but based on the non-custom fit, I suspect it could mar the finish if the non-snug portions flap around excessively over time.",115,0

The cover is large enough and is fairly easy to put on. I will say that it's better if 2 people handled the cover when attempting to cover the car. Taking it off is no problem but the cover is a bit bulky and does not fold into a neat little shape very easily.  I'd say it's a mid grade quality cover. If you go much heavier, you'd be looking at something made out of heavy canvas. All in all, this cover does the job for my purposes.",139,5

The other required the adhesive (which I didn't want to use). The sound from my MP3 was great and I was impressed. However, the communication between the two units is horrible. You have to max out the volume and you get an echo effect; if you can hear the other person at all.

Both of the units have a problem getting the plug from the microphone/speakers to stay properly plugged into the main unit. If they are not plugged in all of the way, the sound does not play for both ear speakers. It usually will only have sound in one unless you press and hold the plug into the main unit. In addition, the unit has a hard time staying place in the mounting device connected to the helmet. It comes out too easily.

The battery only holds a charge now for about 30 minutes on a good day. I have purchased another headset to mount in my helmet.

Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"This product exceeded my expectations compared to the ChatterBox, but after a day of use, the speaker connection started to stutter. The connection for the speakers goes on the bottom of the bluetooth, and it is also used to charge the unit. You must constantly unplug it if you are going to set your helmet down so you do not cause any damage to the connection, but no matter what, it is very sensitive. Therefore, you will constantly struggle to get a good connection between the helmet speakers and the unit.

The clarity between helmet to helmet is not very good, and after a few yards, you start loosing connection. Once that happens, the units will not automatically reconnect and you will have to pull over to synchronize them again.

I will recommend this product over the Chatterbox, which I also returned.

-FM radio? you're joking. does anybody still use that? It kept inadvertently getting stuck in FM mode. Now when im stopped the last thing i want to hear is static on max volume. Terrible idea, and probably the killer for this product.

BTW, I don't understand why the radio frequency is displayed on it when it's outside the helmet. My old Parrots (which sadly died and are no longer made) actually ""spoke"" the radio frequencies as it locked on them. I wish Parrot would introduce a replacement for the SK4000.",101,57

If you are going more than 45 mph, you will not hear anything, or if you have any type of loud or aftermarket mufflers on your bike forget it. I would find something better.",89,67
Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"I bought this device to enjoy while commuting around the Phoenix metropolitan area.
It continually loses connection with my phone.  I've tried MP3's, streaming audio, podcasts, music, a variety of media: it doesn't matter the source, this device will not maintain a constant link with my phone.  I originally thought it was my phone, I've reinstalled apps & players, and sure enough when I use headphones I have no problems, my phone plays for hours without any problems.  When I sync with the Blinc M2, it may work for 20 minutes, it may work for 2 min.  I've cleared & re-synced the Blinc M2 with my phone several times without success.

Here's the kicker, the FM Radio feature is terrible.  I'm using this device in and around Phoenix, AZ where I can literally see the transmitting tower on ""south mountain"".  This thing will have a signal for 30 seconds, then go to complete static & lose the station.  Tune it to a different channel & you may hear it clearly for 10 seconds before its overcome by static.

How can I give it one star?  I got one phone call without a problem.

Automotive,B004FDY27K,5.0,positive,"I have a helmet with a version of this integrated into the helmet and love it!
my wife however did not have one and since we often ride together she had to have one too, but we already had a helmet
it took about 2 min to install and works great, all we had to modify is a spacer behind the speaker to get it closer to her for clarity
Has FM radio and Bluetooth capability, also after pairing they act as an ""intercom"" that is one button to start and stop a conversation.

I think the integrated version is a lot less bulky but they added a few more buttons on this version so its pretty user friendly and the ability to temporarily mount it with the clip means it can move to the next helmet!

After 2 weeks of use the bluetooth reciever was busted. I sent it back to amazon for a refund. Now the speakers that came with it were terrible. The mic was very good though.

Automotive,B004FDY27K,2.0,negative,"This is a great product, from any way you look.
1. It has FM radio function is great, the only point against is that every so often about every 25 minutes off I guess this function for saving energy security in case you forget to turn off.
2. Excellent volume, but this aspect should be very careful, for safety and to hear the other cars around us. The sound of this product is very good but a bit lacking in bass. When you plug your phone as mp3 player, it's great fun and makes you a ride, or simply the way home or work.
3. The multifunction button, does not seem very strong construction, so you must use care not to damage it. The button is very easy to use, even if you use gloves to handle your motorcycle.
4. For sure if you need to leave and locked the helmet on your motorcycle, you can remove the bluetooth.

Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,"I enjoy Robin Hobb's work, but I don't know if I can truly say I enjoyed reading Forest Mage.  It turns everything we saw in Shaman's Crossing on its head, and indeed, Shaman's Crossing becomes simply a prologue to Nevare's ongoing story.

The book itself is relentless and challenging, and I suppose that serves to give us some idea of the life Nevare finds himself facing.  At the end of Shaman's Crossing we thought Nevare had triumphed over multiple adversaries - and he had, but won those battles only to lose the war.

We meet new characters, and old friends return - almost all changed for better or worse, save Epiny, who is the strange combination of selfless and selfish she always was.

Lastly, the magic of Nevare's world is really a character all of its own in this book, in a way rarely seen in fantasy fiction.

Forest Mage is an enthralling story, but one that is truly in the mold of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" - only bad things happen, and the protagonist's world is in ruins at its end.

I look forward to the final Soldier's Son volume, and hope to truly enjoy reading it.",198,0

Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,"A very disappointing story if you have already read Robin Hobb's fantastic ""Fitz and the Fool"" series.  There are flashes of her incredible skill with words as she weaves some beautiful forest imagery, but the story drags and could have been much shorter.  I didn't read the first book and won't read the third.  In justice to Robin Hobb, every writer has to begin crafting her talent somewhere.  Let's have more novels of the same quality as the Farseer trilogy.  Can't wait!",82,2
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,"OK, it took me a little while to get to the end of this series but the journey (while mildly uncomfortable) leads to a conclusion that is profound and touching. I was amazed at the talent displayed here, because it seems the author is treading such a fine line most of the time. There are certain times in the book when you know that if it had been written differently, it would have been offensive and/or uncomfortable to an utterly extreme level. But the artistry behind the way Robin herds your brain into thinking about something a certain way is plainly astounding. It's an intelligent book, and it requires a certain appreciation for the writing that I think might escape some, but for others it is well worth the read.",130,3

I don't know that I can be disappointed with Hobb's works. It just doesn't seem like a possibility for me. The balance of introspection and activity makes this book a true first-person wonder. The richness of the world around Nevare rivals our own world. Gernia is a real place. It's that simple. It's just a different reality from ours. Forest Mage truly feels like Hobb has traveled to that place, plucked a book from their world, and brought it back for us to enjoy. This is simply a masterpiece of storytelling, and one I am pleased to have uncovered.

Fantasy lovers, Hobb is well worth your time. I promise it.",132,5

I love Robin Hobb and I've read all of her Farseer-related works, but this series is just painful to read. Book one wasn't a masterpiece, but it had promise. It was slow, but I thought it was leading up to action in this book. Except this book is even more ponderous, more plodding, more woe-is-me, no action, 50 different ways of saying the same thing until she's filled enough space to sell it as a trilogy. I wish I could say to slog through because book 3 gets better, but honestly it doesn't (although at least the plot has action in book 3, in this one it's just pages of introspection and pity partying). I read through the series just so I could have resolution, but I don't think I'll pick it up again.",157,6

I love Robin Hobb's writing, definitely, and the Forest Mage is full of beautiful descriptive language that really makes you see the scenes, and you really understand Nevare...but the thing is, I guess I am used to fantasy where the hero accepts the strange magic dumped into his life sooner.  Seriously - you don't spend 2 whole books with Frodo refusing to believe the Ring is magical, or Rand al'Thor wandering in the forest refusing to believe any of this has anything to do with him.  I am annoyed by how reluctant Nevare is to accept that magic is real.  So yeah, I think you could skip this book & just go to the third one because nothing important happens.  Just read the Wiki instead.",152,13

Books,0007196156,2.0,negative,"It defies logic, but I couldn't put these books down even though I thought they were quite awful. Hobb is that talented at writing. If you want a quick review of this book it goes like this: He (Nevare) gets fat, people laugh; he gets fatter, people start to hate him; he gets fatter, everyone hates him; he gets obscenely fat and realizes its due to ""speck magic"". Yes, being able to use magic turns you into an obese creature whom I can only assume resembles Jaba the Hutt from Star Wars. Yet I still read it because Hobb writes so well it lulls you in. Trust me, its totally not worth it.",113,17

Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,"I am a huge Robin Hobb fan, especially after reading the Farseer and Liveship Traders trilogies.  I also really liked Shaman's Crossing - the first book in the Soldier Son trilogy but after reading Forest Mage, I am afraid to read any more of Robin's books.  Forest Mage was a brutal and awful book with very few redeeming qualities.  There is so much more that could have been done with Nevare's character.  Instead, I found him obsequious, disgusting and cowardly.  And that opinion has not a thing to do with the fact that in this book Nevare is battling magic-induced obesity.  It has more to do with his depravity.  He was an amazing character in Shaman's Crossing but now I actually despise him and don't want to read another word about him.  I kept hoping as I read on and on, skimming some of the worst passages, that things would improve, that Nevare would do something to make me like him again but it never happened.  If I hadn't been on an eight hour Transatlantic flight with just this book, I would've stopped reading it which is something I rarely do.  Robin Hobb - what were you thinking?",198,24
Books,0007196156,5.0,positive,"Once again I read reviews bemoaning lack of ""action"" and ""emo"". If you've read the first book you know by now that there aren't any epic battles with swords or guns. You also know that you are journeying with a man through all of his thoughts and fears. What is different in this book is the emotional intensity of Navarre's experiences. Relationships are destroyed, I mean not just killed but ground into the dust, revived, and then beaten back down for good measure. Navarre is often helpless, frustratingly so and I yelled at him quite a bit though a lot of the time I'm not sure I would have made a better decision. The problem is none of the choices are great choices. There is nothing that will make everything right. That's true enough in the real world, but in this one there is powerful magic to distort and magnify everything. Little is left for human dignity.

Well this book kind of took me through the emotional wringer in a lot of ways and it is hard to believe there is another one. I read it pretty much non-stop.",189,25
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,"I've liked Hobb's other series but had not read the Soldier Son trilogy.  I read the first, ""Shaman's Crossing"" and thought it wasn't quite on the same high level but (OK), I'll reserve judgment.  I've just read ""Forest Mage"" and will not read the final title.  ""Forest Mage"" shows the hero at the beginning as in a bad way, removed from the past prospects that he originally had.  He is essentially down and out.  The novel then proceeds to show him failing at every single test.  At the end, he is a despised fugitive from society, his family, the law.  All of this is unmerited and he is entirely passive.

If anyone enjoys reading a fantasy of complete destruction of the main character, then this is the novel for you.  Making it even more amazing, he is touched with magic but never comes to the smallest understanding whatsoever about himself or the nature of the magic.

Nicely written, as always.  If the reader isn't depressed at the outset, then his/her depression is guaranteed by the end of this sodden fantasy.  No stars, a failure.",184,26

Books,0007196156,4.0,positive,"I was disappointed in this book partly because my expectations of Robin Hobb are so high. Her characterisations are excellent, her plots full and thought provoking. She writes with a passion, and makes you think about your own assumptions and actions.

But in this book, Nevare Burvelle IS Fitzchivalry Farseer. The protaganists are so similar that it quite spoiled the book. Both are procrastinators. Both are cursed with an unacceptable magic. Both are forced to break all ties with their family and end up being believed dead by the ones they love. Both share a similar morality. The list goes on. Robin Hobb has simply recreated a character that she lovingly brought to a conclusion once before.

This series could have been written by another author. The characters were too few, and too simple. One of my most favorite things about Hobb's books are that her characters are so dynamic. You can relate to them, they change over time, and there are so many. While technically this world is as creative and as original as her others, I didn't find the overall reading experience pleasurable. Most of the time I was bored or irritated with the characters and storylines.

If you are a fan of Hobb and looking to explore this series, I'd say you are better off missing out. If you are new to the author, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD start with another of her trilogies.",162,32

I really like her character development & believe that the individuals who gave marginal reviews of this book are simply not developed characters themselves yet (I'm still a work in progress too.) The philosophy of her main characters (the good guys) clearly illustrates the battles we all wage on the road to being good people & does so in an entertaining fashion. The bad guys are extremely frustrating & well constructed. Call me Robin!!!,102,33

This is absolutely one of the worst books I have read in ages and I tell you with all sincerely to skip it and pick up something else. I couldn't stand reading through it after 3/4 of the way in and just gave up. Not going to read the final book. It is that depressing.

I started on Way of Kings instead and that is so much more satisfying.",121,34

I do not understand the author's equating obesity with magic.  Maybe it will all come clear in the last book, but I won't read it so I won't know. It sure seems like she has some kind of obsession with weight....
This book was hugely depressing and I cannot fathom how anyone can say they enjoyed this book.  I lost interest in Nevare early on and the story just got darker and more depressing, as well as having many obscure plot moments (what was with the spinning top thing that somehow related to the Plains folk magic?  Weird.)

With that said I must say that I enjoyed this book just as much if not more then the first one.  I enjoyed the pacing and story.  My only criticism is that on the dream sequences the author is much too descriptive for my liking. Other then that I like the world she created and the characters as well.  If you are a fantasy reader that loves to love the main character then this might not be the series for you.  He is definitely the central character in the story however he is not an archetypical fantasy hero.  He's kind of an uninteresting character thrown into an interesting situation.  I find it entirely very interesting though.  I think the author is at her best with this story.  The story might not be as enticing as the Farseer Series but her writing is topnotch.,171,37
Books,0007196156,1.0,negative,"I personally need to see a protagonist to get through a book, and this series offers none. I never cared about the main character and by the first quarter of the second book I hated him.  The characters seem to follow a script rather than a pattern of normal behavior and this becomes blindingly obvious when he gets fat and EVERYONE rejects him to the point that they want to kill him. Conflict is driven by a malicious unseen force that no one has any hope of overcoming. It's like reading about a hobo who walks along a train track knowing that he's going to get hit by a train and he keeps walking. And he's got his wife and kids with him. But I don't care about the hobos family either because I have no reason to. There is no good or bad it seems, just a constant force of nature that's going to kill everything, but it happens three books too late. I didn't finish the third book.

I enjoy the depth of characterization Ms. Hobb creates (for the most part). I also enjoy the story of the day to day struggles of Nevare and his ability to overcome. Nevare is flawed, which makes him a more interesting real subject as are all the others in the book. Ms. Hobb has a gift for fleshing out the characters and the story.

The MINUTE Nevare began to gain weight, he was insulted and shunned by EVERYONE (except the Specks).  I think only one character at the end was nice to him.  I am hoping that the reviewer who called Nevare a fat slob was being fasecious and not as insulting as Hobb.

I wonder if Hobb is working through some issues of her own and chose to explore them in this text.

The ""fat"" stigma which Nevere faces was well chosen as this is something that hits home with readers. Our culture too despises fat...readers can face the same internal loathing as Nevere.

Unfortunately, the pain was to acute and I could not make it past page 200 when I realized that he would never loose the weight that he had been cursed with from the Speck plague.
Hobbs writes this tale of a man cursed with majic fat. This fat cannot be lost through diet or excercise. The fat changes the way people perceive him, gets him kicked out of the Academy, and disowned by his family. I would love to know all that happens but the first person telling of this poor man's distruction was to difficult.

Forest Mage, the second book in the series, follows Nevare as he travels home from the Academy to Widevale for his brother's wedding.

I imagine that people who only get a thrill from reading a constant stream of fight scenes may find this book a little slow, but those who take an interest in a character's internal development will have trouble putting it down. Though, I must add that once you adjust to the pace, there is plenty of action and suspense to enjoy, with a touch of horror for spice-- I found it quite gripping.

The idea of a fat hero is rather original, but the appeal ends there, he just gets fatter and fatter (more full of magic). And periodically makes some social blunder or has sex with a whore. The sex scenes are both frequent and disgusting, with far to many details. I was considering throwing this into the donation bin at a libaray, or perhaps a book burning, but I did, eventually finish it. The suprise ending is somewhat original, even interesting, but not nearly enough to save this train wreck.

As the story unwinds, you find yourself swept along whether you really want to be or not.  Whether you feel empathy or revulsion, you are on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. Ms. Hobb's characters are flawed and sometimes you end up slapping your forehead over dumb decisions they make.  But the point is that you care about them anyway.  At least, I do.  I can feel the bouts of power and helplessness that Navarre struggles with.

The Farseer Trilogy is one of my favorite sets of reading.  I can see similarities between what Navarre and Fitz suffered.  Is it magic or fate?  Self-sacrifice or hopes for the future?

The underlying moral question this book poses is: how complicit are we in others' suffering because of our wants? The corollary question to the answer is then: what do we do about it when we recognize our complicity? You're not going to find these questions addressed in your typical thriller or mystery. I agree that the supernatural / religious part of the book didn't quite fit, but neither did it reduce the power of the message. I'll gladly take a book like this over ""Dark Rivers of the Heart"" any time.",129,29

This is a book filled with love suspense, danger and a little Poe thrown in for good measure.

This is not my favorite Dean Koontz book but it is not bad either. I think that it was a little slow on the upstart but the ending was fast paced and well worth the reading of the rest of it. The subtext of this book is that you can't buy life you just have to live it and let it be as it should be. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy, romance, horror, and drama.

What I've come to expect from Mr. Koontz is... well, heart. His books are far less focused on cheap thrills and gore than some of the other authors that I've read, and the results can vary from time to time. There is usually a good amount of hope behind his work. With this book, the heart is there (I really don't mean that as a pun) but it takes a different form. It twists the story and the character in a way that I wasn't expecting, and I quite enjoyed seeing that play out. I don't want to give too much away with this review, so I'll just leave it at that.",139,51
Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,"To me, this is not so much a thriller. I guess many would have been disappointed with the mediocre treatment of the story. There is no gory death scenes, no chasing around the globe adventures and certainly there is not even teeth-gritting intolerance of injustice. There are, however, a good build up of characters, a good surprising twists to events and the love between the two protagonists is endearing. I have never been moved emotionally by a thriller, but this one almost moved me to tears at the end. There is forgiveness, giving and redemption. A very high value of human nature indeed. How on earth does Dean Koontz add these two elements of thriller and spirit, all in one novel? May not be his greatest work, but I like it",131,52

Also, it bothered me that the nutjob Violet didn't get arrested and didn't have to pay for her stalking, assaulting and near killing him. I really wanted Violet to get a smackdown. So. Bad. Yes, it sucks that Dr Hobb was a slimeball and should be persecuted, but that wasn't Ryan's fault. If this is indicative of Koontz's stuff, I'm wary of trying out any more of his books.",130,53

From that one to Odd Thomas to Life Expectancy (one of my favorite stories), Dean Koontz has consistantly put out very readable works. This one stands alone.
I often loan or give books I've read and enjoyed to friends and family. This one went straight into the garbage, as I couldn't subject anyone that I like to the horrible waste of paper this was.
I don't know if this was just a ""publisher's deadline"" book, but I can't possibly see what anyone would take away from it. As the ending began, I actually looked back thru to see if I had missed a portion of the book.

Books,0007267568,4.0,positive,"I actually liked this book. Mr. Koontz has always been one of my favorite prolific authors.
He's changed style as he has gotten older. This is a perfect example. The plot is a very good one & has a tendency to make one think.
Ryan Perry, 34, has it all. He's made a fortune in the Dotcom business. He suddenly finds one day he's in dire need of a heart transplant.
He receives the transplant successfully; now his life begins to become very strange & begins unravelling.

Though a very good idea for a story, there are parts in which the author leaves loose ends dangling. No justice for Dr. Death who apparently murdered Ismay Clemm? The beauty Violet, for the most part, simply vanishes shortly before the end. The end holds no great surprises. In fact, it may be a bit over the top as the love of his life, Samantha, re-enters his much altered life. Alas, possibly too late?

It does carry some of life's lessons & may very well leave you thinking of your own life & mortality. I just wish the story was packed a bit tighter without the loose ends. I still enjoyed the novel.",200,62

I've read almost everything by Dean.  He's one of my favorite writers.  However, this novel is the bottom of the barrel for me.  These suspense novels are falling short--not because they're poorly written, but because the Dean Koontz standard is so high.  Dean's imagination is the thing that first drew me to him.  Where are the strange ideas? Where are the tales of terror? Where is the cross-genre genius of Dean Koontz?  This novel, Your Heart Belongs to Me, is not Dean Koontz...at least the Dean Koontz that I long to read.

He needs a transplant. but I don't want to say anymore and ruin it. That being said, the story is brillant I love it just as much as his other novels. I'm glad I continued reading because if I had stopped in the middle, it probably would have recieved three stars, very low for a Dean Koontz book.

This one here is slllloooooow. You have to read 150 pages before something significant happens. There's lot of things that don't make sense and once the villain was revealed and her motives, I felt cheated. I even stopped within the last 10 pages to brush my teeth before bed--before actually finishing the book--something I've never done with a Koontz novel.

It simply left me scratching my head wondering what Koontz was thinking. The climax ended so abruptly, I kept thinking it would start again in the next chapter but no. THen, then romantic interest was a disappointment too. The book jacket was better than the book.  Worst fiction book I have read in long time. Sorry, Dean.

As a paranoid myself, it shows how one's mind can do so much harm taking a person to places where no one would ever hope to go.

Books,0007267568,1.0,negative,"As a long-time Koontz fan, I was excited to get this book.  Unfortunately is was a huge disappointment and the story didn't even make sense!
He writes about Ryan's love interest's mother and the mother's boyfriend, as if they may eventually have a part in something. Nope, just turns out mother's bf has a creepy house.
Also, what was the point of developing Ryan and his girlfriend's love story at all?  They don't even end up together; apparently deep down she knew he was the kind of shallow guy would who take an unethically harvested heart??
And the ending was irritating too.  I get that Ryan was trying to make up for his previously shallow/money-rules-all existance, but come on, an orphange?  Real believable.
For someone who can write books like Intensity, False Memory, and Life Expectancy, this book was just not up to par.  A double disappointment since this was the first hardcover Koontz that I ever paid for!",159,93

The story never comes together in a way that makes any sense.  LOTS of loose ends.  Even a new ""character"" quickly tossed in near the end to help ""wrap-up"" a book that I think Dean Koontz himself was sick of writing...Part of me wants to say ""shame on you"" to Dean Koontz but part of me can't even believe that he was the author.

While the premise of this one was intriguing, it took way too long to get to the ""meat and potatoes."" There were many questions that weren't answered. SPOILERS AHEAD: What was the point of Isme Clem coming to Ryan BEFORE the surgery, when she couldn't have known about Lily? Why did Violet have to have the final showdown at Ryan's dad's house, a character we never really heard about until that last scene? Why did she get up and leave after beating him senseless and torturing him> What about all the focus on euthenasia and the fascination with the pictures in the folder?  Why the Poe fixation? These are just some nagging questions.

While I found the premise intriguing (about killing people for their organs), it seemed overly prosaic and pretentious at times.

Dean, buddy....get back to psychological thrillers already. ""Watchers,"" ""False Memory,"" heck, even straight-out horror like ""Phantoms."" Enough of this happy, lovey-dovey cockadoodie.",174,98

The ones that happen are never really explained.  The relationship sours and you are left hanging with no solid understanding of what happened.

One reason I love Koontz is that his ""good guy"" characters are personable, funny, good-hearted. This character...I couldn't understand what motivated him and in the end I didn't care.

As a writer, I'm sure he wants to experiement with different styles and different means of telling a story.  I loved the book and thought that psychological aspect was riveting, even though at times the main character was not always likeable.  For me that made the character growth even more rewarding.

who will love this book
folk who feel that succesful people are ruthless and selfish, who have class envy and wealth jealousy.  who love to see a rich person get whats coming to him and in the end to see that person humbled and contrite like the re-education camps for the land owner and business classes in countries that have been taken over by the communists. or if you prefer keynes over friedman.

who will hate this book:
people who have worked hard and become succesful seeing myths about themselves being continued by an author who seems to be drifting politically left with this work.  maybe he will catch up with steven king.

I truly pitied the protagonist of this story.  Everybody loves an underdog, and so do I.

He falls in love with the driven writer, Sam, an identical twin whose sister died, and here, his trouble starts.  Sam is just not that into him.  Then, the mysterious physical symptoms start.

It's disappointing to me how low Koontz has sunk. I've read all of his books, and I still re-read some of his earlier ones. One of his books, Lightning, is my favorite book ever, as is one of his short stories, Strange Highways. What happened to the Koontz who wrote those? Bring him back, please!

I wasn't too spooked by the book.  The worst parts for me were Spencer's apartment and the violence near the end.  Those parts were quite creepy, but that's to be expected in a horror/suspense novel.

At the very end of the book {don't read this if you don't want me to give a large chunk of the end away}, the author missed the point of life and faith and all that, and I am going to write to him and tell him nicely where he went wrong. =)

But I think he was trying to get in the popular mainstream and write books like other popular authors (Jodie Picoult-Change of Heart).  I am not sure what he was trying to do.

I'm not sure I let everything sink in the first time.  This is a very interesting Koontz and a little different from a lot of his.  The protagonist, Ryan, is a complex character and the story is told with a very tight focus around him.  Many things go on in the beginning to middle of the book that really aren't understood until the end and even then you should not be expecting the answers to slap you in the face.  The understanding of these things is more deep and subtle than a cursory reading will at first reveal.  It is there and readers should dwell on the meaning of this one a bit.
  Overall this would not be my first recommendation to someone new to Koontz but a good read for someone looking for something worthy of deeper consideration than the typical industry thriller.

I don't recall another of his previous novels with this plot line, which is good since lately some seem to repeat the same theme.
This reminded me of Misery by King only in that it explored the disturbing, twisted mind of a stalker who becomes obsessed with someone.
As usual, Dean's humor is laugh-out-loud funny and the suspense builds and builds and grabs you by the throat until you are gasping for a breath.
Koontz is hands down the best psychological thriller writer this country has produced.
His prose nears poetry at times and his insight into the human dilemma is unparalleled.

The story starts out interesting, it grabs you, but doesn't deliver in the end.  The characters are not well developed, the story is choppy and implausible.  The surprises and twists are simply ommissions in the plot narrative that are revealed at the end.

Not every book a great modern author writes is a great book.  I understand that.  What bothers me is what I perceive is the seemingly obvious ""reduced effort"" or ""rush"" for a book to meet a deadline or satisfy a publishing contract.

Books,0007267568,5.0,positive,"Koontz's ""Your Heart Belongs to Me"" comes at the precise time that Americans are grappling with the realization that they may have played a part in the meltdown of the global economy.  Greed takes many forms, and for those of us who play by the rules, it's hard to assume responsibility for the breakdown of such a huge entity lead by such crafty manipulators.  But Koontz does a masterful job in illuminating how the five ""roots of violence"" can play an insipid role in our lives.  So, through the journey that protagonist Ryan Perry takes to self-awareness, we see in ourselves how a cultural psyche can mislead us to believe that more is better, and at any cost.  And while this tale is not about Wall Street, it is a testament to the power of those human ""failings"" of ""lust, envy, anger, avarice, and vengeance"", and worst of all the denial of truth.

An unusual love story, where the intimacy becomes less but the true love becomes more intense. It was refreshing to share the life of a dot com billionaire for a change instead of the good, simple, poor, Odd Thomas. But the Evil is the same - truely wicked and twisted.

Koontz defintely did his homework about heart transplants and cardiomyopathy so for those interested in such it gave a glimpse of the disease.

Why is it that a whole nation plus countless others were responsible for the big bad thing, Koontz's villain only blames the RICH hero?

The novel suggests how different characters in 21st century Bushwick, Brooklyn, adjust to such an environment.  Some find escape through alcohol and other drugs; one longs for a kind of transcendence, a need to believe that there is a power out there that is aware of what we do; some try to stay forever young; one considers suicide.

Cunningham is a master at breathing life into his characters; each one unique, original, deeply flawed and totally sympathetic. I've read all his books, and this one is a favorite, in some ways reminiscent of The Hours. The author's intertwining of his characters' less-than-perfect (and often painful) lives, carries the reader through the difficult, sad events of the story.

For the math problems, the book does not explain the logic behind any formulas used (rather than helping you understand the material, it wants you just to memorize it). Questions and explanations in the verbal section are equally confusing and illogical.

On the Mechanical section, many of the diagrams have ""printing problems"" making it difficult to answer any question involving measurements, circuitry, etc. Regarding problems where you have to identify the ""correct"" tool, the explanation tells you what the correct tool is (and its function), but explains nothing about the other tools and their functions (therefore, unless the SAME question comes up on the real exam, you're likely to get it wrong again).

Bottom line..........for the Math/Verbal sections, you're better off with a GRE or SAT prep book, and for the Mechanical section, try to get ahold of a High School physics textbook. The ARCO book is good only for the practice exams which you can take under timed conditions.",193,13

In short, the explanations stink (the editors routinely use oddball approaches in their math and skip whole series of steps) and there is not enough background material or pointers to references.
The entire mechanical comprehension section is lifted wholesale out of two freely-available Navy manuals and the test questions are just the examples that the Navy used.

As other reviewers have said, a book which explains certain math problems or english theory would help those who find they are lacking after taking a couple of this book's sample tests.  I would agree that an SAT book might be helpful as a companion.

There did not seem to be much craft used in developing the plot.

I wondered along the way how much actual Marine history played into the story, in terms of the fight to keep the Corps alive. (Interested enough to research that later.)  The problem is that the story wasn't compelling enough to have an ending that wasn't supported by the events that lead up to it.  390 pages of showing someone's emotions progressing in one direction so the reader can be tricked with a ""Gotcha!"" at the end.  Well that's fine, if the 'gotcha' seems plausible, but in this book it absolutely didn't.

SLIGHT SPOILER - The ending reminded me of 'The Partner' by Grisham, which had the same problem.  I don't read Grisham anymore, because to me that was a big let down.  The last two pages were not reasonably supported by the first 390 or so, and to me, that makes for a bad book.",201,13

Some of the characters are interesting, like the Russian fellow who had a great subplot going, but even his ending is a letdown.

Books,0060746955,4.0,positive,"Tom Clancy is an amazing author.  We have begun to expect thrilling novels from him.  Net Force is just a step above the rest.
 The book begins with the assassination of Michael Day, the head of Net Force.  Net Force is the governments computer control agency, believed by some to be ore powerful than the FBI and CIA.  The assassination is the spider in the web of events leading to the exciting conclusion.  There are five main characters in this novel: The Selkie, who is an assassin trying to take out the replacement head of Net Force, Plekhanov, who is trying to take over Ukraine, Alex Michaels, who is the new head of Net Force, and Toni Fiorella, the martial arts master.
 This book has some very thrilling moments like ""Ruzhyo placed the wavering crosshairs on the mans chest"" and ""He turned and saw the old lady with her cane held over her shoulder like a baseball bat, ready to belt his head into the bleachers."" are just some of them.

This book got me to read again, before I thought that I would never find a book that could give me the pleasure of adventure but then a friend gave me Net Force and I fell in love with it.

""Who ever controls computers controll the world"" that has been true for the last 3 decades and computers are only getting started.

That kind of a jump can happen in VR netware in there is an  external influence which drives it.
The book itself was excellent...the  relationships between Toni and Alex as well as Tyrone and Bella were right  on the money.  Sgt. Frenendez and Col. Howard gave it the guts or glory  energy it needed.

There are good insights into human nature, and into the nature of male love and lust. Good insights into Elgin and Blue and the way they feel about the woman Jewel. And why they do what they do.

This is the opposite of a sermon. But it also is not a very satisfying story. Not because it lacks meaning, but because it lacks a well developed aesthetic sensibility.

The other book was ""Coronado"" and I thought it was horrible.

Each of the stories here is dark and each is haunting in its own way.  Like any reader, I have my favorite(s), but the collection as a whole carries the Lehane touch.  I waited awhile to buy Coronado because, like most readers, I was waiting for the next Lehane novel.  Paging through the book it felt odd to me, particularly with a two-act play that grew out of one of the stories.  I should have read it earlier.  Any 'collection' is, a priori, uneven, but each of the stories held my attention and 'Running out of Dog' and 'Before Gwen' are unforgettable.  The stories also take Lehane away from his geographical base and demonstrate the range of his talent.

Peter Decker is asked to investigate a fifteen year old murder that is now a cold case, that of a very popular guidance counselor from a Los Angeles school who was found in the trunk of his Mercedes shot in the back of the head execution style. Interest in the case has been raised because someone else has been murdered in the same fashion and found in the trunk of their Mercedes.

Faye Kellerman always writes a well plotted, interesting mystery and The Mercedes Coffin is no exception. I enjoy reading about the Decker and Lazarus family as much as I enjoy the mystery. The only fault I found with this book is that Rina Lazarus did not play as important a role in this book as she has in others I've read.

So she makes a deal with the LAPD, offering a million-dollar endowment if the original case is revived and solved.  Who can resist such an offer?  Certainly not the cash-strapped police department.

So, the stage is set for another Peter Decker-Rina Lazarus novel.  And a marvelous tale it is, complete with the customary references to the couple's orthodox Jewish beliefs and culinary tastes.  Lt. Detective Peter Decker is assigned to the task, and he quickly becomes involved in both cases (with a little assistance from his detective daughter Cindy).  The task becomes complicated  with additional murders, especially those of one of the original detectives.

As entertaining as the novel is, it is intriguing in its composition, keeping the reader perplexed amid the lies, deceptions and relationships among the cast of characters.

As the seventeenth Faye Kellerman book in the Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus series, The Mercedes Coffin was a complex book that addressed the current exercise of solving of cold cases.  As someone that is very interested in the Jewish faith, I was a little disappointed that we did not see more of Rina in this book.

The story line has Peter investigating a 15 year old file of the murder of Dr. Ben Little, a school VIP.  His department was asked to look into the case because of a request received from a very wealthy woman who promises great things as a reward. When a second victim is also found in the truck of his Mercedes, there appears to be a tie-in to the previous unsolved murder.

Faye Kellerman's books always have twists and turns and solving this mystery is very complicated and takes thinking outside the box.  You must pay attention to what every person says who is questioned. The clues are there hidden in their statements.

As a fan of Faye Kellerman's Decker and Lazarus series, I look forward to her next book.",192,56

I'm glad that I'm a fast reader and didn't mind wasting a sick-at-home afternoon on a mystery that wasn't much of a mystery, with characters you remember liking -- but in this outing having difficulty remembering why -- and a plot that felt like the product of a bad computer program.

It's understandable that Kellerman could be running out of steam on her Decker-Lazarus series. There've been enough of them.

Still, if you were to read the dust jacket blurb,  ""A cold case turns red hot threatening to consume everyone it touches -- including L.A.P.D. detective Peter Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus -- in the spellbinding new thriller...,"" you'd have to wonder if the blurb writer read the same book you had.

It isn't that I have anything against Judaism, it's just that I don't like being proselytized to or having religion constantly shoved in my face. And that is what Kellerman does, with her constant references to Orthodox Judaism, the family values, the good woman slaving in the kitchen and sacrificing for her children, etc.  It reminds me of accidentally picking up one of those Christian fiction books and finding myself in the midst of some characters who talk about nothing except how they're postponing sex until marriage, how they can be born again by giving their souls to Jesus, what they're wearing to the Purity Ball, etc.

Sorry about this review as I have read the entire Decker series very happily over the years....will definitely give second thoughts after this one about what I'll do with the next title....The supreme irony here for me is that I long ago stopped reading her husband's books for a very similar reason..Oh well....there are enough really good writers out there that we have many other choices...",141,64

I kept laying it aside and picking up again, forcing myself through the tedium.  When I finally made it to the last page, the outcome was disappointing, vague.  See for yourself.  There could be no murder conviction based on the evidence presented.

Keeping the characters straight was a problem.  There are all sorts of low lifes without much to distinguish one from another.  Then there is a great deal of extraneous material--what characters wore, every time they were presented.  A disciplining editor should have cut a hundred pages or so of fat off this.  The plot isn't all that good either, even if this were edited better.  Kellerman tries to write a gritty police procedural, but it isn't up to the standards of Ed McBain or Michael Connelly--or to Kellerman's previous work.  The grit somehow doesn't feel right.

I found that the story was slow to develop and many times I had to re-read a section just to wrap my mind around the cast of characters.  There were just too many names being thrown around.

What disturbed me was the author's frequent need to bash people who have political and philosophical ideals different than her own, and which had absolutely no relevance to the topic at hand (other than to expose the author as a hypocritical morality bigot).  It would have been so much more entertaining to read about the restaurant industry, rather than to have to put up with her moral relativism (Republicans and diamonds are not okay, but paying $20,000 (!) for a single amazing meal and people who vomit from the excess, are).

  It is a kind-of sweet story about a young woman and her New York job---which could be in almost any upper-end restaurant from the way the book is written. There seemed to be much more about her romantic relationships than about her work, which is fine---except the book is supposed to be about her work.

The romance was hot and heavy as  Lina and Hunter yielded to their need.  The story was rich in Mayan culture and belief, and violence as blood was shed in sacrifice.  Lowell's characters were rich and well developed, strong in their individual rite.

The story was shrouded in mystery and very intriguing as Hunter and Lina searched for the missing artifacts.  Returning to Lina's childhood home, they were met with an ailing grandmother,  a selfish mother and a temperamental father, and a cousin lost in the traditional Mayan ways of the past.

The most perfect, most beautiful of all sacrifices was to be the Mayan princess, unless Hunter could somehow stop the event from happening.  His entire future depended upon it.

Books,0061629863,4.0,positive,"Beautiful Sacrifice takes the story of the 2012 Maya prophecy to new heights. Dr. Lina Taylor is descended from the Maya and Spanish who conquered them. She is the daughter of two very strong and complicated people and the current heir to the Reyes Balam lands in South America. She has studied the Maya on digs with her archeologist father and now teaches about the complex culture. When Hunter Johnson, former ICE agent and a sometimes student comes to her with photographs of stolen artifacts, she is drawn quickly into the hunt and into the treachery and fanaticism of those who worship the ancient Maya god Kawa'il, whose nature and rituals are shrouded in mystery. Bodies pile up as the blood of sacrifice rains down because a power-hungry entity known as `El Maya' wants to usher in a new world order - with the Maya as victorious this time. Plot twists and heart-stopping action entwined with a developing relationship are masterfully rendered by Ms. Lowell's hand. While sometimes surreal, each discovery and person fits seamlessly into the story giving it a real-life feel as we come inevitably closer to December 21, 2012 and its myriad possibilities.",196,35

After reading the book, I have increased admiration for Martha Stewart -- her energy, drive, generosity, adventurous & positive spirit, & her vulnerability -- while, conversely, nothing but the lowest opinion of the author, summarized in one word -- contemptible.

Anyone with the least shred of decency would not stab in the back a friend of 20+ years -- much less in public and for profit!!

Furthermore, after all those years, the author really has to sift and stretch to find any ""dirt"" to dish.  And if Martha isn't an absolutely perfect person, well, guess what?? neither am I!!

This mean-spirited attempt to smear Martha just ends up revealing the author for the mean-spirited, snake-in-the-grass that she is.

Mariana lost her livelihood, her home, and many of her friends when she told the truth at Martha's trial. Again, I don't understand how people can accuse her of riding on Martha's coattails for 20 years (are these Martha's friends or employees writing this?).
I have also felt that Martha was a driven person who sometimes probably didn't understand how her actions affected others, and this book confirmed that. I pass no judgement on Martha; she has flaws just as the rest of us do, and as Mariana does I'm sure. But it's certainly interesting to take a look at her life, her homes, and her relationships.

Is it his wife, is it even the mother?

Guthrie's writing is strong on dialogue, which many writers find hard to do convincingly. Some writers talk tough but their characters just end up sounding manufactured. Elmore Leonard is a master of great, natural dialogue, and while Guthrie's characters are a world away from Leonard's, they have that same tough-sounding realism. I liked what one reviewer said about Blood Simple - that's a really good comparison. Like the Coen Brothers' movie, it's gritty noir yet also occasionally comic. And the characters are totally real.

Yes, the sound quality is better than the one inch speakers in my IBM ThinkPad but not nearly as good as your typical $19 desktop computer speakers. The problem is that the sound is limited to highs with little if any midrange. Bass is nonexistent. It's like listening to a pair of big tweeters.

I show off these speakers every chance I get,and the reaction is always one of amazement. Now while they're not the equal of my desktop speakers,they're 25 times better than my laptop. The surround sound effect makes a real difference when heard for the very first time. While a bit pricey for most people,if you own a portable dvd player,or a laptop,
you will increase the value of your product and your audio-visual experience many times over. I also use them with my mini disc unit. In new york city,where things have to be just a little bit louder to be heard,these speakers impress!!!",150,14
Electronics,B00005LOIP,4.0,positive,"Easily the best portable speakers out there and probably the only portable speakers that aren't more then glorified headphones.  The sound is rich and full, although the bass will hardly rattle your teeth.  The speakers are incrediably compact, about the size of a double cd jewel case.  The I-Mac-esque color scheme is an aquired taste (Am I the only one that misses the days when computers and electronics only came in Black, Silver, and Putty?).  For a pair of speakers to throw in with your laptop, MP3 Player, or portable CD player there's nothing better.
PROS - Superior sound
  - Very Compact
  - Easy to set up
  - Fairly long battery life
CONS - [light] plasic and cardboard construction
  - Somewhat pricy
  - Weak bass
  - Questionable looks.
  - Seperate amplifier
  This is a very good effort and I hope Sonic Impact tries again.  Make it with heavier plastic, integrate the amplifier into one or both of the speakers, raise the bass a tad, bundle it with a compact DC adapter (or better yet a USB power option) and lower the price into the sub-50 dollar range and this would be a breakthrough product.",194,15
Electronics,B00005LOIP,2.0,negative,"The unit works well after sorting through all the wires. The lead from the music source is extremely short and requires some dexterity.  The biggest complaint is the battery cover which refuses to stay on with modest handling. Also, the on-off switch is cheaply constructed and I found it prudent to remove the batteries when travelling.  Switch activated when travelling and caused battery loss. A neat gadget for the price. Sound quality is more than reasonable for the weight and compactness.",81,16

Then I asked about the type of memory. The store clerk had no idea.  He climbed a ladder to find the box, and still we couldn't make heads or tails of the info.  I used the web to find all sorts of reviews.  Nothing specifically mentioned the memory.  Then I found the previous review here at Amazon (GREAT reviews).  This settles the issue for me. What do you do when on vacation and you simply MUST buy another mem card?  With this camera, NOTHING! If you are not concerned about this issue, then definitely buy this camera.  You will not find a higher resolution for the price.  Be aware though, this is a ""point & click"" snapshot camera only.",145,0

It did have 2x optical zoon but used the wrong memory for me. I own a Palm M505 and want to have compatibility with that and my MP3 player. Even though the other chips may be superior in maximum memory capacity and probably speed, I think companies should standardise or we end up wasting our money as they change their minds. I purchased a 64MB MMC chip at Amazon quite cheap and it will work in my palm, the MP3 player and the Kodak camera... Go Figure. At least Kodak gave us the option in the DX3700. Others should but the DX3900.",127,1

I was a little worried about the new multi media cards being used compared to the most widely used compact flash cards.  My fears were quickly subdued when I did a little reseach and noticed that alot of your highend cameras coming out now are switching to the new MMC cards.  As for pricing on the new cards they are right in line with the compact flash cards.  These prices came directly from Kodak's web site.  A 16MB Compact Flash cost 25.99 compared to the new MMC at 26.99, also comparable were the 32MB cards with about a two dollar difference in price.  I'm sure as more camera's begin using the new cards higher memory capacity will come out also.  This camera was extremely easy to use, I was taking pictures about five minutes after I unpacked it.

The 3700 uses an SD or MMC card that is hard to find.  Once you find them in some retail stores, they cost 3 times more than their CF counterparts.  SD or MMC are smaller in size and are intended for miniaturization, yet this camera is bigger than Kodak 3900, an excellent camera that uses CF card.  Therefore, this card format doesn't make any sense.  Another disadvantage of this format is the maximum size for the SD card is 64 MB as compared with 512 MB for CF card. Since the internal memory allows me only about 7 pictures at the highest resolution, I tried to order a 64 MB SD card...  The price in retail stores costs up to 5 times more.  Now I have to use the pitiful internal memory and always carry a notebook computer wherever I go. The purchase turned out to be a disaster.",172,3

2. Battery life is short. Do not trust the computer when it says battery life is good. You will run out after taking a few shots. If you gone to a day trip you must remember to turn it off everytime after you take a pic in order to last a few hours

Kodak customer support is a joke, if not down right rude, and offers no help. The problem withthe camera is that the batteries last for only 3 or 4 shots. If you buy the Kodak lithium cell($20.00!) it lasts for about 20 shots. If you do a little research you find that the camera requires 3.3 volts at up to 2.5 amps. No combination of AA cells deliver 3.3 volts (rechargables deliver 1.2 volts per cell and even lithium cells only deliver 1.6 volts) and anything south of a ""D"" cell won't deliver its rated voltage at 2.5 amps for very long. The long and short of it is that the DX3700 was a defective product from the start and short of fabricating an external battery pack with ""D"" cells, you better look for another camera.",187,7

Pros:
Low price for 3.1 megapixel camera, ease of use, quick battery recharging (less than 1 hour), great picture quality, excellent macro shots, decent (if slow) software

The unit does not automatically switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio (wheras my Panasonic does), so I have to manually set the aspect ratio each time I switch from a widescreen DVD to a VCD or a 4:3 DVD.  I have read reviews that tout the AD-800 as a great toy for a technical person due to its many user-adjustable parameter settings. But I think the unit had so many user-adjustable parameters because it lacks the intelligence to set them automatically.

Great features for the price!
There are some issues with the Progressive scan, but overall it does a relatively good job. Heck, I would say that for the price, it does a FANTASTIC job.

Easy plug, load, and play, many kinds of connections to choose from with all the cables, although the manual is quite bad with very few details, this might be that you needn't to do much to operate the machine.

Electronics,B0000691LX,1.0,negative,I bought this after seeing someone else with it. It's very difficult to take clear photos due to the size of the camera - the only way is with the tiny tripod (which is pretty impractical).

Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,"For - Great design, really small, easy to install, superb software, extremely easy to use, quality tolerable
Against - Refuses to take pictures indoors (even on inside mode) unless your room is very bright, therefore can't capture any night time events so its not for students!!!!! Will flash up error. Size would make it ideal, but as it won't take pictures its useless for this. Quality is limited. Proper digital cameras (1.3Megapixel) ...
Overall - If they added a flash or even made it work in low light (even if results are not stunning) it would be a great little gadget. As it is, I'm dissapointed because I've taken it out and it won't take pictures. It may fit into your pocket on a night out but it won't work! Taking fireworks tonight proved impossible, it still thought it was too dark. For daytime use its great for web pages, but the quality is nowhere near a proper digital camera, then again the resolution is better than competitors.

I have a nephew who is almost a year old and I am excited about taking his picture and sending it to our extended family that lives several states away.

I can honestly say that of the 100s of pictures I took with it, not one was a keeper. The shutter stays open for so long that unless you are completely motionless, your pictures are blurred. I found that subjects centered in the view finder do not end up centered in the pictures. The camera ""crashed"" often, and I needed to take out the battery to ""reboot"" it. This happened a lot.

Electronics,B0000691LX,2.0,negative,"This is a fascinating little product - carry it in your pocket without any weight.  I love carrying it along to kids games, and the kids want ones of their own.
It has a few drawbacks, however.  Some expected, some that need fixing in the next generation.
The expected (but still a little disappointing)
- limited focal length lens means that elements outside the very center of the picture are blurred (barrel distortion)
- No flash for low light situtions
The real problem:
- it loses your pictures when the battery drains down, i.e. its memory is volatile.  Flash memory is so cheap, why did the designers make this choice?
- There is no early warning, actually no warning at all when the battery is too low.  In fact if the battery gets low it will still take pictures as normal, then it freezes up, and all your pictures are gone.
Caveat emptor here - a great product in so many ways, but make sure you replace the batteries early i.e. Every 50 shots or so.  Its not a cost issue, but you will lose your pictures beyond hope for recovery, even though the camera seems to continue to act normally.",201,14

The SiPix StyleCam has all of it. The size of it is very small, which allows me to wear it even in my keychain (the clip is also provided in the package), and it's 640x480 quality is enought for my actual needs. Also to point out that, thanks to it's USB connection to the computer, the download of the pictures taken is really quick.
It has though a couple of inconvinients, which are that whenever you push to take a picture, the camera takes a variable amount of time to actually take it, so you cannot take movement pictures or move much during it or the pictures will end up all messy. The second inconvinient is that inside houses, when the light is not perfect, the camera shows an error and is unable to take the picture (presumably because of the lack of light, as it doesn't have a flash incorporated).

Unfortuntately, I think this camera will get little to no use, because it just isn't worth the trouble of checking to see if the battery is dead (usually yes), taking the pictures, and uploading them onto the computer (if they haven't inexplicably disappeared) using the awkward, poorly designed software (with no documentation whatsoever).

Electronics,B0000691LX,5.0,positive,"I've had a great time with the Sipix Blink digital camera. Took it on a family outing over the Labor Day holiday and came back with great pictures to share with the family. Nothing publication quality but certainly good enough to show people what the kids did for fun over the weekend. The Blink lens distorts the images around the edges, but for snapshooting, it's at least equivalent to the old Instamatics and Polaroids. It is surprisingly good in low light, tho the shooter must take extra care to hold it still.
It's main advantage is its size and weight, both of which are negligible. Coupled with the generous memory (100 to 400 images, depending on resolution), it INVITES you to carry it constantly and shoot pictures of everything.
Two points to remember: (1) It's easy to wrap your hands around the camera SLR style and make your fingers part of the scenery. (2) It's so small and handy that it's easy to lose. I have a nightmare of leaving it in a shirt pocket and sending it thru the washing machine.",182,19

When the kids get some ""vegging"" time or need time alone it is nice to not hear their games or tv shows (esp my daughter's favorite you tube videos which can get annoying).

They serve the purpose but the foam piece on the ears is already coming off right out of the package and when my son put them on I heard a craking sound and it was the slide adjuster piece that needed snapped back into place on each side. He has to do that every time he puts them on. I guess I'm going to adjust them to his 9 year old head and tape them. My younger kids have the same  problem.,112,81

After a week of no headphones, I decided to order these for them. I actually ordered 3 pairs, one for each of our classroom computers. These aren't super high quality headphones, but they are working great for our students. Yes, it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice, padded, over the ear earphones, but we don't.

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,"Cost ok; fits flat on ears with wire to left side. one wire (a good thing) reasonably thick with good male plug. Wire attachment is weak due to lack of moulded strain relief. Strain relief is loose tube which is better than nothing; perhaps a little glue between the wire and tube would be an improvement? Sound is not loud and is not as good as my other, cheap memorex. Padding is thin foam which probably helps by providing friction to keep the speakers in place on the ear.",89,91

Electronics,B00006JPRN,5.0,positive,I have already written a review for these little headphones.  They are small and you get what you pay for.  I love them because they fit my pea sized head! They are also cheap enough that if I sit on them or they do break I can replace them without tears. The sound is not incredible but definitely okay.  I use these more than the more expensive pairs I have bought. They are small enough to fit a child and if you are hard on your headphones these are a great little extra pair to have around. I really enjoy mine.,101,106

Electronics,B00006JPRN,4.0,positive,"These are in the Goldilocks Zone: Just Right-Just Right-Just Right! They are just the right price to feed to my 8 and 11 year old, both of whom have 'breakable tendencies.' Six of these lasted 9 months, an absolute bargain compared to the more expensive sets I was buying based on an assumption of robustness. These are just right so that they can be hauled around, dropped, kicked, jammed in the bottom of a backpack and they just spring back.

It takes quite a lot to do them in, and in the meantime, blessed silence, since each child is welcome to plug their headphones into their tablet so that the rest of the house doesn't have to listen to game-play or inane music for hours on end. A lifesaver on a plane, roadtrip, etc. For ears too small to accept earbuds, these are the perfect compromise.

The sound is tolerable....for games or light music listening. Not a lot of dynamic range for this price point, but that's not what I'm praising them for.",173,111

Maxtor replaced those without any issue, except that the replacement drives (which were refurbished) also failed within 3 months.  Quite and fast mean nothing if you end up losing your data.

After crashing a couple of times already, the drive seems to be heading to the death zone after the latest crash.  Of course, as another reviewer noted, the waranty is shorter than the short life of this drive.

This may appear to be a bargain but it does not last so it is very expensive in the long run.

I would not use a Maxtor drive even if it was given to me free bacause it is not worth the time I spend on recovery every time it crashes not to mention the unrecoverable data between backups.

Never again Maxtor.",137,9

I've built many systems with many different hard drives and have only had a couple fail. They weren't Maxtor, but it just as easily could have been. If you value your data, either back it up, or go with a RAID system. Failures can and do happen, no matter what brand of drive you buy.

As far as the whiners that gave this drive poor marks, what can I say? Looks like instead of rating it on the merits of the drive itself, they took out they frustration because of either poor marketing, or an obvious case of not reading their own system manual before making the purchase.

Make no mistake. This is an great drive (for PCs built in this century) and when on sale, offers ample room for drive hogging chores, such as video editing and archiving. I highly recommend it.",185,13

Installation was simple, I just popped it into my PC and it was recognized immediately.  I installed the Max Blast software and the drive was partitioned, formatted and ready to use in less than 5 minutes.

I went online to Amazon to return it and found that the window for returning it had closed. (slam)
I would think that since it is defective that the window for return would be 30-90 days as it is for most electronic devices that are defective.

But I am wrong about this. As soon as I turn it on, the snow is all over the screen for the analog channels. For the digital channels, the converter box show the signal is jumping between 0 to 5%. I don't think it will cut off the signal. The only thing I can think of is that it amplifies the noice too.

Electronics,B000BB80TQ,2.0,negative,"Yeah, the Nano Dock is useful; however, be aware that it comes with NO cords whatsoever.

On the other hand, like most iPod accessories, it's outrageously priced. It's nothing more than a molded block of plastic with a couple of wires running through; it can't cost Apple more than $5 each to make.

Electronics,B000BB80TQ,5.0,positive,"I tried hooking up my iPod Nano to the home theater system and had to crank up the volume WAY up both on the iPod and the HT system to get desired levels of sound. With this dock, the sound is back! Color-matched with the iPod, this is a recommended accessory for all who want to listen to their iPod songs on a bigger sound system.

My alternatives were - buy a Bose Soundock ($299) for direct usage or a Bose iPod Dock ($129) to use the way I am using it now - via the Apple iPod dock! A third alternative - which I have used in the past - is to use Altec Lansing inMotion desktop speakers, which are pretty good, but can't compete with bigger sounding HT.

Yes, it says ""1st Generation,"" but the buyer has to be pretty alert to realize that the new ones are very, very, slightly the wrong size to use this. And the lack of a power supply cord is galling.

I bought my husband one of those Dremel drilling tools for Christmas last year, and it works like a charm to drill out the excess plastic.

Second, the focus of V400 is not good. Sometimes you can see the cursor is shaking without any movement. These days, I found a new big problem. The mouse is frozen when windows xy starts up. I thought it was xp's problem, eventually I figured out it was my V400 mouse. I had a very good impression with logitech. But this time, I will double think when I buy anything from logitech.",138,3
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,5.0,positive,"What can I say? I bought this mouse from Amazon under the ""new and used"" category. It came in the mail, I opened it, put a AA battery in, plugged it into my Macbook Pro, and it worked right away.

The product did not come with mac drivers, but they were easy to find on the Logitech website. I installed them, restarted, set up the two extra buttons the way I wanted (used expose functions, so it's pretty much like a 30 dollar mighty mouse).

The ONLY thing that I've have problems with is that the side-scrolling cannot be adjusted, and it's really really slow. I've gotten good and just clicking it over to make it go faster.

But otherwise, the tracking is amazing, the scroll wheel is really nice, the buttons are great, it's perfect size, very portable. Good mouse.",141,4

Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,"Logitech, so far, always appeared to me as being a first tier supplier of quality mice. I am shocked how Logitech could dare to release such a product. They are actually back to the good old days where users would need a mouse pad in order to get proper performance. The V400 does not work well on dark surfaces, it does not work well on light surfaces and it does not work well on tablecloth. I have actually bought the V400 because I did not like the scroll panel of the V500. To my surprise the V500 with conventional red LED works well on all mentioned surfaces where V400 is a nightmare. It is a darned cheek when Logitech claims to have introduced the V400 ""... all terrain laser tracking technology"".",131,6
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,"Like most other users here, the tracking problems I've encountered have been aweful.  Light or dark, mousepad or not, two different PCs, latest SetPoint driver software, it doesn't seem to matter.  Also, by comparison, I have the MX500 (corded optical), MX700 (cordless optical) and MX1000 (latest cordless laser) on various machines and all work perfectly on the same mousepads and surfaces upon which the V400 fails.  The MX1000 works perfectly on the same laptop with the same SetPoint driver software on which the V400 fails.  Bottom line, it's definitely the the V400!

The V400 mouse will work fine for a while.  Then, if you stop to type something (like the paragraph above), then go back to the mouse and move it, the cursor just stays put.  You have to move the mouse around quite a bit to get it to recognize that it's being moved.  Clicking the mouse seems to wake it up immediately but, of course, that may not be appropriate, depending on the application you're in.

As far as I'm concerned, I have loved everything Logitech that I've ever owned ... until now.  In my opinion, the V400 is a piece of junk.",195,7
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,1.0,negative,"I just purchased this mouse and have used it for 3 days now.  It works well as a mouse, but it is very uncomfortable in my hand.  Having to use your index finger for the forward & back buttons is awkward.  It also doesn't fit your hand well.  I would not recommend this unit. I am returning the V400.  I originally had a Microsoft notebook mouse which works well and was comfortable to use; but I was specifically looking for a notebook mouse with forward & back buttons, the v400 seemed a good idea until actually using it...  I'd love a smaller version of the MX1000.

Note:  the logitech software that comes in the package is an older vesrsion that does not allow the forward & back buttons to work with the Mozilla Firefox browser, you have to download a 47Mb update from the Logitech support site.",147,8
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,"This is the only 5 button notebook-sized wireless mouse I can find and so I gave it a shot. Besides the fact that it does not work on a glass table, this mouse delivers! The tracking is in fact very good on most reasonable surfaces.

Money well spent.",48,9
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,4.0,positive,"I've had the V400 for about a week now and I'm generally pretty happy with it.  The ergonomic design fits my hand well, and the rubber grips make it easy to hold.  The addition of the back/forward buttons is nice, though their placement means that you need to use your index finger to use them.  Another minor complaint is that they're not two separate buttons; rather the two ""buttons"" are part of a single rocker that tilts back and forth, making it slightly more cumbersome to use.  That said, I'm happy they're there at all, as most notebook/travel mice I've looked at do not have these additional buttons.  Aesthetics are subjective, naturally, but I prefer its clean, simple lines to Microsoft's blobby, ill-defined but otherwise comfortable notebook mice.

Regarding tracking, I've noticed that the V400 is stymied by darker surfaces and textures - dark wood and granite are two surfaces where it seems to get easily confused.  However, on lighter surfaces (the majority of the surfaces I use), tracking is flawless.  I docked a star from the review because of this caveat-- not really the ""all-terrain"" performance as promised on the package.",192,10
Electronics,B000BFLNA0,2.0,negative,"Hi all,

I have both, the V400 and the Microsoft 6000, the V400 has many problems, seems like the laser engine has many betas still to go, the tracking is awfull, constantly stopping and restarting, the precision also is too bad, is very difficult to give in the target with this mouse, more if you try with CAD applications, any person, even the basic PC user will notice the bad quality of the laser mechanism.

Is true, is a nice looking mouse, i have many logitech products that are really good, from the presentation bluetooth mouse to the laser one, this V400 seems to break the line of quality logitech has always had.

Kinda disappointing,

I'm uploading pictures of my mouse (Logitech V400 orange), so if you want to have a mouse to look and show, the V400 could be a museum object, but if you want a extreme machine, the Microsoft 6000 is the one to go.

So I am saving up to someday get a aiptek digital handheld camcorder or one of those flip ones instead. this is okay maybe for yahoo messenger if that .I definitly like my Creative Live one better.

But one thing leaves me puzzled and it has NOTHING to do with the device itself...per se.

It has a 3/5 rating! WHY?

THIS MAGNIFICENT THING DOES IT ** ALL **:

Audio & VIDEO online (Yahoo, AIM & MSN)
Still pictures are GREAT with proper lighting (my room has little lighting, so I needed a second source.) (Quick Capture)
Shading Hues
Video Mute

I've been using it for one day (not even) and I KNOW it's early, but this thing has endless possibilities! It was about as expensive at Wal-Mart then as it is here.

Looks: B (if it was black or gold, it'd be an A- or A+, respectively)
Features: A++ (re-check ALL it offers!)
Price: A+

4.75 stars.

I merely followed the instructions in the suse webcam wiki at [...] and I was up and running in a few minutes, chatting with kopete on a yahoo connection to a friend in another state.

Electronics,B000FU0XAW,4.0,positive,"It's pretty good quality. Easy to set up and use, but you get what you pay for. The video quality is pretty good and it adjusts to my indoor lighting pretty well. Sometimes I have to shine some light on myself, but usually it's no different than when I'm doing homework. I don't really use the microphone because I already have one that is probably better. Hoever, I do have one issue. The focus on the camera is manual so you have to adjust it yourself. It's fine when you're just going to talk at the desk and usually just sit there, but if you want to move around and show things, it'll be a major pain, but I guess it's good for what you pay for.

Sometimes the light indicating that it is on will stay on all the time, but that's usually on start up. Once you open a program that would use the video like skype, it will turn off after you're done.

Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,"Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.

One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.

Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.

Electronics,B000IN72KK,5.0,positive,"This is nearly the best thing since pre-sliced bagels.  I bought this after I purchased another unit from Yahoo before I came upon this little jewel.

What this has over the other model is that there is on screen programming and video recording options.

I purchased this to supplement my PSP and new Sony-Ericsson w850i phone.  It works like a charm...

Not only was it a snap to integrate with my set top box but the recoring options ie. bitrate, protocol etc. give you the opportunity to record for any phone that you may own or your PSP or whatever will play a list of A/V formats.

What I love about the unit is that you can record off of your TV or DVD player in the exact format that fits your playback device.  My Sony phone works well with 3GPP so that's what I just recorded '8 Below' in and WOW, there's no stuttering or pixelation...it's great...what can I say.

If you have a similar product, it is well worth it as you do not have to mess with trying to figure out which content providers can provide video content---that you actually want---without paying fees or worrying if the licensing software will allow you transfers.

You can record from any a/v source, even those old VHS tapes with copy protection, straight to an SD card. The only drawback is lack of choice for recording file type. It would be nice to have MPG2 or AVI as choices, especially if you want to burn your results to DVD.

Electronics,B000IN72KK,2.0,negative,"SanDisk definitely had the right idea with this straight to media memory recorder. Unfortunately this is either an early model or they missed the boat.
The remote is hit or miss and selects twice per click most of the time. Starting the recording works well but you cannot stop it. So unless you have a small memory card and want to take everything until full (which is when it will stop recording automatically) then this is not the unit for you.
I hope SanDisk has an upgraded model because this would be great if it could be controlled like a video recorder should be.
The price was right and it was worth a try but this model is not worth even the cheap price.",124,9
Electronics,B000IN72KK,4.0,positive,Unit is a great replacement for a VCR plus has better advantages. I use with 16gb SDHC card and yes it works.

I have a second unit at home for time delaying TV shows from a set-top box.  The home unit has some issues responding to the remote control, but continues to work.  Once I have the recordings, I can play them back from this box, or from other TVs in my house connected to a media player.  Another use I have found for this box is making recordings for my iTouch.

Recording at highest quality works great on a 19inch tv, and while not crystal clear on a large (27"" tv) it is good enough to watch a recorded show. I would not call it HD but it is just as good as my still kodak camera takes video, or even my flip video camera.

The remote is not great. In fact it was almost impossible to use at first. I than did some research and found a forum suggesting the obvious. Replace the battery. Made a huge difference!

It came on but would not respond to any command from the remote. It has no input method other than the remote. I tested the battery and it was dead. I bought a new battery and it sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. The remote is really cheaply made, without true buttons, and sometimes takes multiple tries to get a response. In a video shoot struggling to get your recorder on is a nightmare. The product pamphlet suggests going to a sandisk address online for firmware updates. They do not exist.

In it's ""High Quality"" mode you can record almost 4 hours of video to a 2GB memory card.  You can't expect DVD quality.
  The clunky part is the remote.  All record functions are through the remote, so you have to use it.  Unfortunately it is one of the worst remotes I've ever used.

I also wish I had read the technical specifications more closely. I thought this device was supposed to be able to REPLACE a VCR, but it can't connect to an antennae of any type so you still need a separate video source, i.e. A VCR, which almost totally defeats the purpose of getting this device at all.

I knew there were going to be problems when I saw that the ONLY video connections were mini-stereo plug ports on the back - no s-video, no-coaxial, not even RCA. On top of that, the tiny remote is incredibly FRUSTRATING to use.

It was not a battery problem because I changed them, and one day I wanted to record a show and it took me ten minutes of pushing the ""on"" button to make it work, so I got sick and frustrated, grabbed a screw driver and ripped the remote in two. now I have no remote which means no v-mate.

Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,"WARNING! DO NOT BUY THESE RADIOS!!!

I have alot of experience with two way radios. I live and work in the mountains of Montana and I know the limits and quirks of most types and brands of 2-way radios. I've had no less than a dozen or so models going all the way back to when Uniden had the top of the line with the 5 mile rangers. Anyway, I feel pretty confident that these radios have a serious design flaw whith the symptom of a sporadic cutout of the voice while talking. Its slight but very noticable with regular use. I feel personally that it may be a frequency thing but can't be certain. In addition, the sound of the audio is HORRIBLE! I was willing to overlook the sound quality in exchange for range but it simply isn't worth it. The sound is so bad that it strikes me that maybe Motorola should recall this product. It a serious dissapointment from a company who's name typically means quality. These may be the worst radio's I have ever owned. Sorry folks, this pair of radios are not worth the box they're shipped in.",194,0

Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,"I was immediately disappointed with the sound quality of these radios. It was frequently very difficult/impossible to understand what the other person was saying (confirmed in both directions). This wasn't an issue of being out of range or choppiness or such. Simply, it sounds like the voice is digitized and degraded. I have an FCC license and have owned numerous Motorola radios over the years. This set was a real disappointment. A radio that can ""ideally"" communicate over such a great distance is useless if you can't understand what the other person is saying -- even from a very short distance away.

Furthermore, the housing of these radios lacks durability. The rugged rubberized bumpers that served to protect the former models is gone -- just cheap-feeling plastic now.",128,3
Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,"The Motorola 9500 was strongly recommended. However the  set that I received turned out to be a piece of junk. Very poor voice clarity and quality. We depend on our talkabouts for car to car close range communications and boat to boat line of sight communication both of which were very poor, to the point of just not using them, which put us in a very unsafe position at times.  I did call Motorola and was informed that I was past the warranty time and they would do nothing.

This was over relatively hilly terrain with quite a few trees.

These units have connectors for a headset and also have voice activation.",74,5

Electronics,B000P6J67C,4.0,positive,"The Motorola T9500XLR seems like a solid reliable piece of equipment. Once out of the packaging, the 2 units are charged via a cradle. I have used these in my neighborhood and overall they worked pretty well. First off, keep in mind these are not professional level radios, they are merely entry level units for home & family use. They are ideal for road caravans, amusement parks, shopping malls, cruise ships, etc. As other reviewers have mentioned, the voice over the speaker is ""tinny"" and using them in extremely loud environments seem impossible. The range is definitely nowhere near the claimed ""25 miles"". In a typical setting, you are lucky to get half a mile in the city and 1 mile in the country.  Just remember these radios cost around $50 for the pair and you simply cannot expect professional quality at this price point. The NOAA radio feature worked as described and battery life was never an issue since they recharge with the cradle. Overall, I wish speaker and talk quality would be improved and maybe add a water resistance feature.",182,15

We used them for two days (my son and I) to try them out at the beach, at home and at a big park.  Once we found the right channels, they worked perfectly all places.  I did try to test the distances (difficult while walking), but we did try them at least 2 miles apart and they worked fine.  There was a bit a static at the beach, but not too much.

Electronics,B000P6J67C,2.0,negative,"For all of the features and capability they put into these radios, Motorola forgot one key element...sound quality.  Other reviews that mention 'can't understand what someone is saying 1/2 mile away' aren't referencing range but the garbled noise that comes out of the speakers.

With only a passing knowledge of audio electronics, it would seem that Motorola is overdriving the amplifier or speaker, as the sound is very 'clipped' sounding and horribly distorted.  They could also use a modest compressor on the input, as the quality is very sensitive to mic etiquette on the part of the speaker.  For a radio that's marketed as a 'family' product, they should realize that many kids are going to think of these as phones and hold them right up to their face when they talk.  After 20 minutes of coaching my five year old on how to use it, i still couldn't get anything more than a sentence or two of intelligible speech out.

These are getting returned, unfortunately, as they seem to have all the features i want.  We'll try again with Midland i think.",183,20

Electronics,B000P6J67C,1.0,negative,"After owning 2-way FRS/GMRS radios by Bellsouth, Cobra, and Motorola, Motorola radios were always the highest quality.

I purchased the T9500XLR (their current top-of-the-line 26-mile radio) the other day to replace my T4900s. I was appalled at them. The sound quality from the speaker sucks compared to the older, cheaper T4900s. And worse yet, the sound transmitted cuts in and out continually - at any range and at any transmit power. Whether in the next room or half a mile away, the sound was the same low quality with voices cutting in and out. No settings affected this.

I use a good tripod and a shutter release and I still get horrible photos.
Another thing with this lens is that a ring on the outside of this device came undone. I have to push it back to be able to focus. It seemed it was glued on.

You will need to use some sort of support, though, best a tripod, otherwise you'll end up with blurred pictures.

Obviously, you're going to get better results from the Canon, and if you want to sell your photos this is going to be useless.  It hasn't got any bells or whistles, no autofocus, no image stabilization, so you're going to need a tripod too.

I would characterize the results from this lens as 'barely acceptable, sometimes'.  But still, if you wanted to take professional style photos, you weren't going to get that from a $90 500mm lens.",105,19

I went around and asked a lot of different sources on getting a relatively inexpensive telephoto lens beyond 300mm. They all said the same thing- there is no such thing, if you go cheap you are wasting your money.

They were right. I was extremely disappointed in this lens. If you think you're going to freehand this without a tripod, there is no possible way to do it. If you set it up against something stationary, it's still going to cause a snowy white image. You have to use your tripod or the shot is wasted.

The quality of the photos would rate approximate 6/10. They generally appear a little darker with quite a bit of grain.

*** UPDATE ***

The handle-bar mount is a universal fit device. It clamps to your handle-bar by the use of heavy-duty zip-ties and DeLorme provides a self-stick rubber sheet that you wrap around your handle-bar before attaching the unit. While it is a primitive design, it works flawlessly and I tested it on some rough road before I considered writing a review of the product. It has not slipped at all and the PN-30 is held securely at just the right viewing angle for me.

I would love to see DeLorme modify the mounting kit to make it easier to put the GPS handheld into the bar mount, but, it is so secure the way it is designed, so, I am pretty sure they make it the way they do to prevent the unit from accidently coming loose if you are mountain-biking or riding a rough road like the Pan-Am Highway.",194,10

Believe me, if this clamp got stressed to the point of snapping you would know about it. The handlebar bracket was a sloppy fit, but wrappng a few turns of black electricians tape around the circumferance of the handlebar between it and the clamp took up the slop.  No slop after I tightened it. Solid as a rock. Now, my handlebars are only 22 mm diam. close to the brake cable mounts and then it flares up to 25mm in diam. towards the gooseneck.

Then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints. We put the whole machine on a metal tray--to make clean-up easier. Finally it got so bad that, fearing an encounter with boiling hot water and/or the risk of an electrical shock, we stopped using it.

In the end, I was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket (it's a circular one-piece with a tiny hole in the middle) from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug. I then inserted a filter, coffee, and poured in hot water from a stove-top kettle. While this sounds ridiculous, it's a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine.

My recommendation: avoid this machine. It's disturbing that Black and Decker would produce a product so dangerous and lacking in quality.",194,0

This corer will squeeze out some juice, so you want the pineapple to be just ripe, not over-ripe, although it squeezes out much less juice than the plastic spiral kind.

The corer is made of sturdy metal which is dishwasher safe.  To use, slice off the top and bottom of the pineapple, stand upright, position the corer in the center, and turn clockwise while pushing down.

They do such a nice job, I do not think I will be turning on the floor heater. Instead, I ordered more to handle the bedrooms. I could pay money for an old furnace in the maintance and up keep or I can save and use a beautiful efficient panel heater. Easy to install and not bad on the eyes.

We have had this unit over a year now and use it in the winter months for our sons room which is the coldest room in the house.  We turn it on at night and by morning his room is much warmer than the rest of the house.  It does get slightly hot, not too hot to where you would immediately get burned if you were to touch it.  In my opinion this is far safer than any other heater.  It does not run our power bill up and there is no saound while it is on.  I researched many heater before purchasing this one, and I must say this turned out to be better than I expected.  I was very skeptical at first to whether this would provide enough heat, but now this is the only heater I will use in my Children's bedrooms.",154,15
Home_and_Kitchen,B0006393L8,5.0,positive,"Great heaters. I've used them for years with no problem.

One thing though...

When first turned on, they outgas for the first 24 hours. They give off an odor as the material cures the same way many appliances do. If you don't want to smell it, give it a day in the garage, then move it inside.

Other than that, they are the apogee of heating technology. They come as close to the comfort of woodstove heat as electricity can and are basically invisible.",84,16

I have a hard time retaining heat and my wife has a hard time expelling it. The problem with most space heaters is that they heat the room well beyond the temperature you set the thing too. This heater will always comfortably heat a room very evenly. It gives off a comfortable, radiant heat. This is wall mountable which means it won't take up any space in the room. Summer storage is just wrapping the cord around it. My advice is to mount on the wall near the person that likes it warm. It helps to create a slightly warmer pocket that won't affect the rest of the room. I have sinusitis and this heater really helps my sinuses drain.",144,17

The other side of the heating unit was begining to turn black and smolder.  We unplugged and removed the heater immediately.  It took about 2 weeks before the burning chemical stench left our room.

They are very easy to install and take up no space - they don't even look like heaters attached to the wall. We bought 2 because we were so impressed with the first one and decided that we needed one for a different room. It is true that they only heat an area of about 100 square feet, but they do that very well. What's really neat is they get comfortably warm to the touch, but don't burn, so they are safe to put in small areas - and great to lean back against for a toasty back.

While at the time of installing these heaters in our apartment we did not pay for our own electric, it only makes sense that they cost less than most other electric heaters. An old heater we had ran at 2100 watts and these take only 450. My 2 computers run at 750 watts each! It must be cheaper than a less-efficient source of heat.

I have only used a couple of days so I'm not sure what effect they will have on my electric bill but hopefully the same or less as the space heaters we were using.  I am conserned because the walls in this room are wood shingles?  and they seem to heat up.  We are looking at other options on mounting.  I have purchased the electric temp sensor so that it will turn them off and on as needed.  They do get a little hot to the touch but for most adults I don't think it will be an issue.,133,24

You must place them on a solid wall such as drywall.

At first, we tried placing it in our older home on some paneling that had nothing behind it but the studs. The paneling is thin, and the wall got a little too hot for my comfort.

However, I found that if you place it on drywall or other solid surface, the wall doesn't get hot.

There is no noticeable difference in the electric bill.

Once it gets cold and stays cold, we leave it on 24/7.

We use ours in the laundry room which is roughly 100 sq. ft. and it works wonderfully, and we're glad to have it for that purpose, but we wouldn't purchase any for the rest of the house as they are not aesthetically pleasing, nor would they be efficient for the rest of the house.",169,25

It didn't have the heating power I expected.  I found the small Soleus radiant heater gave of a lot more heat for 400w, which was the same amount the panel heater used.

We contacted the company several times to complain, but they would never get back to us.

The detail documentation that came with the heater says that you can expect 10% of the heat coming from the face of the heater.  That is all the heat you get!  The truth of this heater is in the 90 warranty, by the time you figure out it does not work, the warranty has expired.  This Econo-heater is a great idea, but get an oil filled heater for heat.

With one each in our master bedroom (northeast corner), study, and adjoining sunroom, the results have been outstanding.  Although deep winter has yet to arrive here in Maine, our Monitor runs only a third of its normal curve...the Econo-Heaters maintaining a soft, even heat in those outer rooms.  For our application I feel it's best to avoid large swings in temperature and we choose to let them run most of the time, however one could use timers or thermostats with the units if desired.  We have yet to figure any specific heating cost reductions, but anticipate considerable savings, especially as we face increasingly high fuel costs.

I even went out and looked at the power meter when all the panels were active (4 big and 2 small panels) and the meter was barely spinning.

I wish both the thermostat ant the timer were digital.  The timer is an egg timer type dial, and the thermostat is a slider, amking for somewhat impercise settings, though this is relatively minor.  It's still a very good deep fryer.",143,2

So we have this plastic covered can (the housing for the oil resivour is even garbage - impossible to remove oil from the finish of it)  So at $60 and an 8 time usage, it would have been cheaper to go get junk food out.

However, this is the standard rule for HEPA filters and for 10 bucks on Amazon, it is considerably cheaper and more convenient than using a bag-type unit.  Contrary to other reviews, I have never had a problem with this vacuum - in fact, it consistently fills up the bag-less container every time we vacuum.  We were amazed with the amount of dirt this thing picks up. We didn't expect much when we purchased this vacuum (due to the price), but considering we use it about 1.5-2 times per week, I'd say this has been one heck of a bargain!",126,0
Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,"This vacuum blows...literally.  The exhaust fan blows in front of the vacuum at floor level so it blows everything you want to sweep ahead of you and into the air, and you'll never catch it until what is to heavy to become air borne is stopped by a wall. This is not obvious on a rug because the rug camouflages it and holds the dust better...but just try it and see on a bare floor.  Granted, you can overcome this design flaw by sweeping backward or only using the tools.  Granted, it also has good suction, but that just means a stronger airflow coming out of the exhaust.  I bought this on the recommendation of Consumer Reports, and I already wrote them a letter and told them to test it again, hopefully with someone who knows how to vacuum.  I did not believe the previous amazon reviews that point out this problem because there's always some one who isn't happy...my mistake.  Check out the other reviews and don't buy.",169,1

I ran right out and got one.  I found it to be cheaply made, which was sort of expected with its $50 price tag.  It did a semi-OK job on hardwood floors.  But when I moved to carpet, the suction was so strong that I could barely push or pull it.  And even though the suction was strong, it only picked stuff up on the side that had the air in-take.  When I went to empty the dirt holder (which had a lot of dog hair in it), I tipped it upside down over the trash, and nothing came out.  I had to shake it w/ all my might to get the thing to empty, and then the filter fell out in the trash, so I had to get that now-dirty thing replaced before I could finish up.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,"We bought this vacuum three months ago, and my experience has been similar to the other 1-star reviews: it's not worth the money.  It indeed blows dust on hardwood floors, and is basically ineffectual on those surfaces.  We sweep first, then vacuum the pile with one of the attachments, and this really defeats the point of having a vacuum.  Then the brush roller broke after 3 months.  Just like the other writer noted, it doesn't turn true (it sounds like its bearings are shot); we got it out before it broke the belt or destroyed other internal parts. No abuse to it otherwise, it's just a faulty part that is not covered by warranty, and is now out of stock for another month.

This is a very bad product, and horrible corporate support.  As a customer, you should be skeptical of buying ANY product from a company that doesn't stand behind their units.  This is yet another example of the evils of big-corporation America.",164,5

And yes, the brush roll, as with any I've owned, will get stuck if there is too much hair, string, dental floss, etc stuck on it. In this case, you take a scissors and cut it off.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,I purchased this based on a recommendation from a friend with carpeted floors. I have hardwood and to me this is the most counterproductive cleaning device imaginable! It LITERALLY blows dust away from you before you can get the suction part over the area. There is a very powerful air output on the lower front of the cleaner. Right now I have dust bunnies and dog hair floating through my living room and am sneezing my head off as I write this. If you want this effect you might as well sweep with a leafblower. AWFUL!!!,96,8

I have hardwood floors throughout my home and before I purchased this vacuum, I would have dog hair all around the floor and baseboards that seemed to build up when the ceiling fans were running.

It was top of the line when I got it and still works perfectly.  The Dirt Devil was so cheap that I thought I'd buy it and have an extra vacuum on another floor.  I'm glad I did.  I have three cats and this thing picks up the fur like nothing I've ever used.

I didn't find that emptying the container and cleaning the filter was all that messy.  If you do it in a deep trash container it's no big deal.  It's a lot worse to change the bag on my canister.

My only complaint is that it's very noisy.  My cats agree.",132,13

We have to vacuum the carpets quite often because of the puppy dragging in dirty roots and all manner of things from the back yard. We have very hairy, shedding dogs. and it's been great to just pull out this little thing and make it all go away within a few minutes. Our old canister was so expensive and bulky and didn't pick up as well. Also the rug in my bedroom is kind of strangely made and the canister didn't pick up the dog hair from there at all. This one does.

I do understand the complaint about blowing but ours has nonetheless done fine on hardwood. Love the bagless element. If it only lasts one year, it will have been well worth the price. Yes, noisy, I really couldn't care less.

UPDATE, THREE YEARS LATER. The vacuum has finally had it. The carpet brush no longer works though it's still semi-operational. We'll get the same model again. Such a great price.",190,16

All of the attachments work well, it's a sporty red, and really the only drawback is that it's quite loud (but then again, most vacuums are). We love that it's bagless, which seems a little more environmentally friendly, and you can see through the canister so you know when it's full to empty it.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000FE5LK0,1.0,negative,"I have this vacuum and it is now broken. The bearing that holds in the brush is made of plastic, it started vibrating causing a horrible noise. Eventually, the vibration caused the plastic brush to come out of place and literally melt from the friction of rotation. No worries though, you can buy a replacement brush for about $20 + $5 S&H, which comes to $25 on a $50 vacuum cleaner. Yeah right!

The F1 filters are very difficult to find in stores, although I found one at Target selling for $40, 80% of the cost of the whole vacuum cleaner! You can get them online, most places want to charge at least $20, but Amazon has them for around $8.

Not worth it since it breaks so easily and replacement parts are too expensive relative to the original low cost.",166,21

Can I get a refund on this ?",72,27

White feathers inside the comforter would poke through the exterior(top of blanket) with debris. It looked amess and very unattractive.

It was three times the price of the one I just bought from Amazon, yet identical in every way with the exception that the Amazon purchase also came with a bedskirt.  It's lightweight but warm, has a good loft while still being flexible, the filling is actually down and not the pin feathers that tend to crackle and end up poking through the fabric. Other reviews I've read on this product reflect disappointment that the shams are thin.  Well, they're shams, you know?  It's the pillow within that gives a sham life.

He has never had a down comforter before and couldn't believe how warm and cozy it is.  The brown microsuede is an impressive and durable fabric.  Just before writing this review I asked him what his review would be.  His reply was, ""It was sent straight from heaven!.""  Yeah, a little dramatic but he really loves it!

The reverse side of the comforter is a cotton or a cotton blend that is slightly lighter in color than the microsuede.  I will be using the bedskirt to construct some box pleat valances for his room just because with everything on his bed it was just too much brown.

I am also going to be ordering this set for my youngest sister who was jealous that a 12 year old had this nice of a comforter set.  She thought it was a $200 set!",164,51

The house is very modern, so we're using a lot of black and chrome for our accent colors.  I was a bit impulsive when purchasing this set, however the fact that the duvet is down, and that it came with a matching dust ruffle really sold me!  The dust ruffle brings the entire set together.  It provides a much sleeker look.  I was hoping the down duvet would have been a little thicker, but overall I am very impressed with what I was able to get for the money.  In addition, I thought the pillow shams were perfect.  Usually shams are too thick and bulky, so I don't put them on the pillows I sleep with.  However, these shams were thinner, yet elegant, and very soft/comfortable enough to place on a pillow you will be sleeping with.  (Not just for decoration.)  Great buy, excellent value !!",168,52

It was soft, soothing, and warm. The next day I matched it with a bright pink 300TC sateen sheet set from Amazon and it really made it pop. The next day when I came in from work I felt like I was in a new room, it even looked as if I spent much more than I did. It's a great buy.

I bought two and fit 6 regular mugs on one and only 4 giant mugs on the other. My narrow width shelves are set in so the rack slips on and does not get in the way of the doors. The mugs hang freely which means they lean forward so I can't slam my cupboard doors or I'll smash my cups but who does that anyways? The doors close easily. The metal holder does stick up on the upper part - however it's symmetrical so large flat plates fit nicely, or bowls centered. But I wouldn't put more cups above it without laying a flat cutting board or something similar.

It is all one piece that is supposed to slide onto a shelf, but if it isn't a small shelf, it won't fit unless you bend it far apart.  Then, once you get it on the shelf, you can't put anything directly above it due to the thickness of the piece that holds it in place.

First, it has pegs to hold 8 cups but I can't get 8 of my cups on it and my cups aren't overly large.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,"Just got these in - and I agree with other reviewers that they are not good for sliding onto standard shelves at all. Measuring, toward the joint, there is only a half inch between the arch of the holders and the bracket. I got it about 4 arches in before having to give up (with the outside portion no longer lying flat in doing so). I also broke one trying to open up the bracket enough to slide the last arch on. It looks like some of the mounting posts for the screws are bent too far inward. My shelves are 3/4"" thick.

Gave up, ended up screwing them into the bottom of the shelves, which I had purposefully bought this particular product to avoid. It's nice looking and works in half its capacity, but DO NOT PURCHASE if you're hoping to slide this onto a shelf more than 1/2"" thick. Too big of a gamble that you'll get one that won't slide on.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,This only fits very small mugs. Normal sized mugs must be placed on every other rung and get crowded. You also can't place anything on the top shelf because that's where it slides in. Takes up more room than it creates.,41,72

Earlier I had purchased one of the Under the Shelf 10-Hook Space Saver Espresso Cup Storage Drying Rack / Cupboard Mug Holder - MyGift, now that one fits perfectly.  Unfortunately, I bought the last one available from Amazon and the message is that they don't know when it will become available again.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"Very sturdy & well-made, fit my 3/4 inch shelf perfectly without wobbling around. The only drawback is that my mugs face a different direction than I prefer.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,It works for me but it definetly does not fit big  mugs uniformly. If your cabinet shelf is not set back from the door you can't use the the two hooks on the end but it frees up space so you can fit them underneath. All in all I like it and am glad I purchased it.,57,105

I have standard, run of the mill cabinets in a house built in 2006. Nothing unusual. I had to pound the poop out of this thing with a hammer to get it to fit. It is definitely made for super skinny cabinet shelves.

""Can store up to ten mugs or tea cups""???  I'm not sure where they're getting their mugs, but it might fit 10 espresso cups.

I'm giving it 2 stars because at least it's sturdy.",84,111

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,Perfect for my cafe cups. Frees up shelf space for other cups,12,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,Construction and idea are fine; just Very poor design. Shelf must be very thin (maybe 1/4 inch) for it to slide onto shelf. I had to break off first hook just to get it to work even poorly. Disappointed to find one on same search page that doesn't have this flaw. Not worth the effort to return so it's lost bucks. Figure out what I'm talking about before you buy.,70,118

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"Good quality and design but I had to return it because it wouldn't slide on to the cabinet shelf as one of the pictures  The gap is too narrow for my new cabinet which has thicker shelves.  However, it also comes with 4 screws for mounting if you are fine with drilling on your cabinet.  I did not want to drill any extra holes on my new cabinets.",68,124
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"Works great! All of our coffee cups and stemmed glassware are hanging by these under our cabinets. It pretties up our kitchen, and it frees cabinet room. These holders are also really sturdy.",33,125

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"This thing works ok, but the spacing for 'normal' mugs seems a little too close together. We can fit 6 mugs rather than 10.

Some of these are different depths (different listings, similar product.)",67,130

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,1.0,negative,"You need a very specific situation in order to be able to use this item. Additionally, I paid $10.50, which I consider too high & this item has GONE UP in price? what? crazy. Your shelf to install it on has to be thin, otherwise it won't slide on. You have to have high distance from the stuff below otherwise you can't put anything on the shelf below it. And, you can't put anything on the shelf above it either! Junk unless you have a VERY SPECIFIC use.  Additionally, don't bother trying to install it ""under the shelf"", unless you don't mind going to a hardware store to purchase the correct hardware. The screw heads are too tiny to hold the dern thing up properly, so you need either different screws or the correct sized washers.  Should be able to install something like this in 10 minutes, as it is, it will take a lot more effort than I am willing to put forth, in order to be able to hang 6 coffee mugs. OH YEA, it will take 10 tiny ones (little cutesy tea cups), but not normal coffee cups for a red blooded American who drinks coffee.",199,134
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,It's sturdily made.  It attached to the underside of the cabinet with 4 screws and when fully loaded doesn't sag under the weight of 8 teacups.  Consider your type of cups because anything more than cups that nest when stacked upright won't hang well or many.  Mugs = 4,49,135
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,I have to return this because the hooks are too large. I wanted to use it under cabinet for hanging my utensils. It appears to be sturdy enough to hold heavy mugs very well.,34,136

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"I like it, although it doesn't hold as many mugs, as I expected. It all depends on the size of the mugs to hold the described ten mugs. It looks good, and suits my needs.  I am pleased with the purchase.",41,139
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"There are a lot of questions on this item, pertaining to how thick a shelf it can hang on, etc. I found that the 'slip over' function fits a shelf made from a standard 'One By"" board (so 3/4ths of an inch thick, approx 2.5cm) I used it inside my kitchen cabinet freeing up valuable shelf space, and the door closes just fine with it in place. As the description indicates, there are 4 spaces for screws if you prefer to mount it to the underside of a set of cabinets. A lot of reviews noted that the hooks are spaced for small 'tea' cups, which is accurate, meaning that using the standard american style 'coffee' mug you will only be able to hang 4, maybe 6 mugs on this rack if  you are clever. It seems sturdy and well made, the finish did not have any noticeable flaws that I could detect.",153,140
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,"I can only use 3 of the 5 hooks on each side because they are too close together.

It barely holds 4 coffee cups on each side.  Either way, I have hooks on both sides that are empty.",38,141
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"Very nice and sturdy. Price is pretty competitive with in-store retailers. The rack fits snugly and securely onto the shelf, almost too snugly. The part that fits on the shelf is coated with a thin, clear layer of plastic to ensure better adhesion. My shelves are not quite 1/2"" thick, but I had to 'open' up the rack to get it to fit on so that there was no excess poking out in the front. Try putting it on the shelf first to decide if you need to 'open' it up a bit more though.",95,142
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"This product really made my limited shelf space for my many mugs (I am a semi-collector) much less cluttered and much more neat.  It slides onto the shelf fine and is very sturdy.  The only thing I would like to say in a somewhat negative light is that, like others have pointed out, you are not going to be able to put a mug on each of the rings.  They are much too close together.  I have a variety of sizes of mugs, but using my small (normal sized) mugs, I can only fit 6 (3 on each side).  However, I ended up purchasing two of these and they work absolutely great for what I needed!",116,143
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,This didn't work on my shelves. The opening for sliding over the shelf is really narrow and wouldn't slide over my shelves in the cupboard.

Also can't use hooks closet to door as interferes with door closing with a mug on it.  Kept it as I haven't found a better over the shelf holder; I don't want to make holes in my new cupboards. Maybe should be called a cup holder.",75,145
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"True, it holds 6 of my mugs perfectly, but that's all I needed it for, so it works great for my needs.  I love it!",25,146
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"If you have traditional coffee cups (the ones that look slightly larger than a tea cup) then you can get away with just one. If you have American sized coffee cups or larger (12oz+), get more. A 10 oz cup is about the limit if you expect to get one on each rung. I managed to fit my 16oz cups on each rung but it looked awful (very cluttered). However, once I set it up for every other rung, it looked fantastic.

The quality is good. I have 1inch thick open shelves and this gripped them nice and tight. If you have something thicker or need to close a door over it, I would suggest a mounted system or hooks instead. There are two screws included if you feel your shelf may need extra reinforcement, I felt they were unnecessary in my case. Overall, a really great product!",148,147

Beware they list this product as an Under The Shelf MUG Holder, yet the box says Under The Shelf CUP Holder, which explains why it cannot hold the advertised 10 mugs.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"Our shelf was a little too thick to just slide it on but it mounted nicely under the shelf. Screws were provided but I added flat washers to provide more holding area. I looks like it could hold 10 cups but I think they would have to be very small.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"Installs pretty easily.  There's enough tension in the lip that I didn't need screws to mount it.  The last cup ""moustache"" was taller than the other two so I had to hammer it flatter to make the whole thing fit on my cabinet shelf a bit more flush.  Also I think it could have been designed a bit better.  The front hanger moustache is too close to the door, so you hit a cup w/ a horrible sound every time you close the door.  Looks like it fits 10 cups but it's more like 4 comfortably or 6 if you jam them in there.  Wish I got a sideways one..",110,171

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"It would be great for thin shelfs. It is great for tea cups, made a lot of room in my cabinet. However my kitchen shelf is thick and my husband put it on the shelf because it was to tight for me to due.",44,173

Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"I intended to screw this to the underside of my cabinet, which worked wonderfully, so the size of the arm versus the size of my shelving was not an issue for me. I like the way it looks in the kitchen and was able to get several mugs on it. However, the prongs are not spaced quite as far apart as I had anticipated and the mugs hang very close together, which means some of the larger ones do not fit at all when placed directly next to each other.

I chose to hang my smaller mugs and teacups, which incidentally were also what I planned to hang in the first place. A few larger mugs could fit if they were staggered, though it would be pointless for someone to purchase this item if only half of the space were available for use.

I am happy enough with it that I am purchasing a second one.",156,179

Although it has 8 hooks, it does not hold 8 coffee mugs.  I even tried my smaller fine china coffee cups and they nested on the hooks, which would eventually lead to chipping.  It barely fit over the cabinet shelf, although the closely spaced hooks are the main problem.  Buy this product only if your coffee/tea cups are very small.",78,181

I just used the plastic zip thingies and attached it to the closest wires on the rack and snipped off the excess. Looks fine but when I went to hang my coffee cups I was very disappointed with the spacing of the hooks and could only manage to hang 4 cups (I have 12 and 4 other hooks). I guess I should get rid of a few but they are all really nice mugs (Sanga, Mikasa, etc.)! I guess I could use a set out in the garden. Other than that I really like it and may order a few more and hang other items off of them!",135,183
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,2.0,negative,"Main problem: I can't place normal sized mugs on all the arms because there is too little space between each one. Its a pretty major design flaw. I think it would work as designed if you were only hanging expresso size cups.

I can't comment on the under-shelf feature as I mounted mine under the cabinet. Last issue is that because its mounted the weight of the mugs causes the side that would otherwise be supported by the cabinet to sag.

I would look for a different product if you are interested in hanging more than 4 normal or oversized mugs from the holder.",104,184
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,4.0,positive,"I do like this product, it fits nicely in my cabinet and holds 8 mugs.  Notice there are 5 hooks but in my cabinet only 4 mugs can fit on each side because of the space.  I suppose with more room, or if I put under my cabinet not inside, then all 5 would fit on each side.  Overall, I really like the product and I will probably order another one.",71,185
Home_and_Kitchen,B000G68MU8,5.0,positive,"I really love this thing!  It comes with four screws that you can use to hold it in place, but I find that it works just fine without them.  I do have little tea cups so I can't comment on how well the oversized mugs work hanging on it, but for my cabinets it is a great space saver!  I also like that it looks interesting unlike all the other styles I found.  It measures 10.5 inches deep, 9 inches wide, and hangs down almost 2 inches under the shelf.",90,186

It does lie flat and that is good enough for me. I also bought the same pot cover in a16"" size to use in my very large fry pan for poaching salmon... also very slowly, in ~ 1/2 cup chardonnay, water to cover, 2-3 pepper corns, lemon juice, bay leaf, fresh parsley and a slice of onion. Only takes a few minutes on low once it boils. Both covers are the ones I use the most in my kitchen.",194,61

One Amazon reviewer said about this Fitz-All lid: 'I love mine and would never give it up.' That was a great endorsement, so I bought one. It is 10 1/8 inches in diameter. The aluminum has a concentric circles design, with a very slight concave to the underside. The lid sits flush on top of my Dutch Oven, with no lip or edge to keep it from sliding. No problem, though, and it does a good job keeping in the steam when slow simmering chili or spaghetti sauce. Make sure to measure the pots you have to see if it will fit the 10 1/8 size. My Dutch Oven is cast iron, inner diameter 9 7/8 inches and outer diameter 10 1/8 inches, which works fine with this lid.

Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,"I've bought the cheaper set of barstools with a single metallic looking column.  They're one of the first hits that show up if you search amazon for bar stools.  Pack of two was about 80 and they were very modern looking.

Unfortunately, build quality on both was poor - both broke under gentle use and I am 155 lbs, well below the weight rating.

Very pleased with my first purchase of this stool.

Cushion is quite good after one month of use.  Cushion is deep enough for you to feel a slight sinking sensation.  I have no problem practicing guitar on the stool.

Four legs are very good for stability.  I have mine under an island sitting on Mid level apartment carpeting.  I don't detect any damage to the floor, or any slipping of the stool when getting on or off.

I agree with the other reviewer that buying furniture, especially something like a chair which holds your body weight can be bit of a gamble.  Even so, I like this particular stool enough to buy another one.

Looks modern and subdued.  It matches pretty well with dark brown furniture from Target if you like shopping for modern looking furniture without designer mark ups!",204,0

Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,5.0,positive,"These stools are nice looking, easy to assemble, and reasonably comfortable.  The cushions are a little softer than I would like, so if you sit for a long time your rear gets a little sore.  But they look great and have a nice finish.  They are a lot lighter than I expected, so whatever wood is used is not very dense.

One of the stools had a small hairline fracture in the finish, but nothing major.

They assemble with good quality screws that are nice and long, so I expect these to hold up nicely over time.

EDIT:  As someone ""liked"" my review, here is a two-year update:

These stools are still fine.  I assembled them with a small amount of wood glue on each screw, which probably helped.  The little screw hole ""caps"" popped out after a few weeks, but putting wood glue on them solved that problem.  These stools are used only occasionally, but are still doing great and look brand new.  The cushions are as good as new.  We are still very happy with these.",178,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000PWISM0,4.0,positive,"I got 3 of these for our counter.  We have had it for about 2 months now. For the price, it isn't bad.  We have used it enough, that we know it's not really meant for heavier people ( over 225 lbs ).  It is easy to assemble, but one of the stools had one leg piece that just wouldn't flush agaisnt another piece and we ended up stripping the screw that was supposed to tighten it together so we have a gap that's slightly noticeable.  They are very lightweight and the seat is very ""cushy"", not firm.  You tend to sink into it a little.  It's made of pleather or whatever it is, so it can stick to your skin.  Otherwise, not bad for the price considering how pricey good bar stools can be.  It does look really great in my espresso colored kitchen.  I do still wish I had spent the extra to get a more solid product. Oh well, I hope these last at least 3 years and I'll be happy with that.",176,4

Buy the hooks that have two insertions on the hook itself. They are a little harder to attach to the pegboard,  but are firm and stay in place with no movement or wobble. I found that by ""stretching"" the bottom peg board hole makes it much easier to insert.
 Just insert one of the hook retainers in the bottom hole  and wiggle it a bit too enlarge the hole some.",106,30

Anyway, Crawford, newsflash:  crappy plastic hooks break when you insert them into a peg board.  I just told Amazon that they're embarrassing themselves by stocking and selling something so obviously shoddy. Well made pegboard trays and jars would have hooks made from something sturdy.  A metal band around the jar and a metal hook might work.  I'm pretty sure I've heard some good things about metal hooks, but I'm not an expert.",127,36

The product description states it will work for both 1/8"" and 1/4"" pegboards, and while the accessories will fit in the holes of 1/4"" pegboard, they are ridiculously loose (to be expected) and the biggest surprise is that the plastic locks they include to keep the accessories in place don't work at all in pegboards with 1/4"" holes.  All in all, the product's price was low enough to make the cost of returning it a moot point but the bins and jars, while flimsy, are usable.  If my pegboard was drilled with 1/8"" holes, I'm sure I'd be completely satisfied with this product.",120,60
Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,2.0,negative,"The pegs themselves are decent quality, but they DO NOT fit 1/4"" boards. When you put them into a 1/4"" board they don't sit flat against the board and so you can't put those plastic clips on to secure them. They also don't come with the 2nd peg (not sure what you call them) that keeps it stable. As stated by a few others too, the plastic bin and jar pegs are very flimsy, I was very apprehensive even putting them on afraid they would break.

On the other hand, the longer tool brackets and multi-tool hangers were pretty decent. The entire set is still far less than just the few parts I liked bought individually, so I gave it 2 stars. But don't buy this expecting to use the L or U shaped hangers.",135,61

We particularily liked the small clips that hold the hooks and holder to the board so they don't move, we have never seen those here, we can buy a few hooks sold separately now and then. We recommend this set to anyone that is starting out because the quality and variety is all in one box.",118,62

Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG61Q,1.0,negative,"I bought a set of hooks only from this company last year.  It's really, really bad.  I'll never get anything from Crawford again.  I don't care that the hooks are made of thin wire and don't hold much weight, that's plenty fine for most tools.  It's that the hooks refuse to stay on the board.  The little plastic retainers that are supposed to hold the metal hooks in place don't.  They are difficult to get in place, use up holes that could have been for other hooks, fall out of the holes after a few uses, and get stiff and break in half with age.  Overall, the whole package is a waste of money.  Every time I try to remove a tool from the board, the hook comes with it and falls on the floor.  I was putting them back up, now I just throw them in the trash.  Give it a pass and get pegboard hooks that have a second metal stud on the back to hold them in place.",171,64

Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,4.0,positive,"There seems to be a lot of user error and confusion regarding this bin so let me hopefully help some people out:
These bins are made to work with two sizes of pegboards so that means you need to break off the lower pegs that correspond to your size pegboard. If you have the smaller 1/8"" pegboard you have to break off the middle peg, if you have 1/4"" pegboard you have to break off the two outside pegs. This bin WILL NOT work if you leave all three lower pegs in place.

This is a must have for simple organization on your pegboard. They mount up solid with no play so you don't have to worry about them falling off the wall as you are using them. The bin can be taken out and moved around if you need to but this leads to my only grip; the bins are quite loose which is necessary in order to be able to take the bins out but to me it feels like they are a little too loose. It would be nice if they could be a little snugger in there.",191,9

Industrial_and_Scientific,B0009WG62K,2.0,negative,These bins have 3 upper hooks and 3 lower notched pegs that should align with corresponding peg board holes when you hang them. None of the lower pegs align after you hook in the uppers.  I ordered 8 of these and none align and because they don`t it holds the bottoms away from the peg board which creates an upward angle when they are secured. In addition 1 had all of its upper hooks broken off. My guess is that someone received it in a previous order and tried to force alignment and broke them off. I believe I am going to take some side cutters and snip the lower pegs off to get a flush mount. Without the lower pegs securing the bins they pull away at their bottoms when you pull items out of the bins but I will put up with that. I am contacting the seller to see if they will ship me another bin to replace the broken one. I wouldn`t buy again.,168,11

- the moving part has a wee bit of wiggle, which means any 1/64 in+ precision measures are going to be way off.

These, despite being cheap, are indeed stainless steel and seem  like they'll last me forever as long as I don't abuse them.

They look a teensy bit cheap, and feel a teensy bit cheap, but only because I've seen VERY expensive sets of calipers. These are good, and from what I can tell, accurate to the nearest millimeter at least (I'd certainly hope so...) based on my measuring of things I've measured with other calipers. They were able to measure my 125mm dropouts easily, and have helped me in deciding on how to rebuild the drivetrain on my fixed gear.

I'd recommend them based on their perfectly adequate functionality, inexpensive price, and solid-looking construction. Again, mine are kinda cheap feeling but not to the point of it being a significant flaw. They just don't look like you paid $50 for them. More like $20.",183,91

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,2.0,negative,"For the newer models it just clips on, no screwdrivers needed. The problem is that it lifts up off tile, and brushes make no contact. So basically you end up with a squeegee with a really weak vacuum attached.",39,2

This item works as described, which is a real blessing considering how many hard floors we have in our house. For the quality, the price is good, which is another big plus. The major downside is that this came with no real packaging, and absolutely no instructions at all. The item was just sealed in plastic, with literally nothing else (instructions, packing slip, etc.). If you do get this item (which I would say is a good move, assuming you have hard floors and a Bissell floor cleanr), be prepared to search for directions on the internet. Granted, that's simple to do, but I'm docking a star because of poor packaging and complete lack of materials.",129,6

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,These things make cleaning our brick floor much easier but the seams in the brick destroy the foam in the tool head so we need a few every time the floor gets a major cleaning (about once a year).

Industrial_and_Scientific,B005TEX9Z0,4.0,positive,"This bare floor tool works very well.  The proheat cleaner puts the water/cleaner on the floor and the squegee tool does an excellent job of getting the water back up.  I am sure it is working well since the water is dirty.

I used this on a tile/grout surface without any problems.  You can still adjust the amount of water and cleaner just like the carpet settings.

My only issue is with high traffic areas still not perfectly clean.  This is probably more to do with the Bissel cleaner than the attachment.
I would recommend this attachment to clean hard surfaces.",101,12

When not using my helmet, this thing wears just like a hat. Spin it around and it covers the back of my neck very well. What I couldn't see was how fully it covers my head, and acts as a buffer between my head and helmet band, and actually keeps the helmet from slipping on my head, as it tends to do without the hat. My head is not huge, 22 3/16"" around, which is a MED in practically every motorcycle helmet manufacturer's size chart.",103,12

The instructions say to clean the electrode with distilled water.  No problem! I always have several gallons of those all the time.  Then it says to ""sucks it with filter paper""? Coffee filter paper?  That can't be.  I'll use a cotton swab instead.  I turn it on. Wow! The back lit display is green - pretty!  I had one exactly like it in yellow.  The ridges, the placement of sensors,  dimensions, it's the same stuff with a different name.  Now, here's the big difference: my old stuff worked for 3 months before it began to flash random numbers.  This one,  right from the plastic container it came in just flashed random numbers.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,"I received this item at no charge in exchange for an honest review.

I have a more expensive PH Meter which has a few more features, but for basic checking where accuracy (although this is still accurate) isn't as huge of a deal, this is a no brainer.  The biggest difference here is that when you calibrate it, you are responsible for turning a screw (screwdriver is included) to reset the ph level, others automatically calibrate this.  The cap also does not have an easy way to store sterilized water in it, which can help keep it calibrated.  The good news is that it has a decent plastic case, which holds the meter and the screwdriver.

It's an incredibly low price in my opinion, and having to manually calibrate isn't a huge deal, this is a no brainer.",138,9
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,"Works well under open air conditions. When used in enclosed bucket with the lid only open enough to fit device, gave wildly inaccurate readings (1.5 to 11 in actual 6 ph water). Removing lid completely always worked though.

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,4.0,positive,"This pH meter is easy to read and comes with a nice case for storage. It comes with a screwdriver to use for calibration and a sheet with instructions. I tried it with distilled water and tap water and found that it does not give a precise reading - it sort of fluctuates a bit around the correct pH of the fluid. Thus, it can give an approximate reading but is not precise enough for scientific work. This is fine for home users and a useful item for this price range. I was provided a free sample of this item for my honest review.",104,11
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,2.0,negative,"For any accurate, consistent readings, this item is next to worthless. If you are measuring something where the reading does not need to be completely accurate, this will do just fine. However if you are getting this for hydroponic or water testing use I would recommend investing more money in to something more accurate. I am using this for water testing and need to re calibrate every single time I use it, which ends up costing me calibration-liquid cost...so in the end I am no better buying this cheap tool. For me it's barely tolerable.",95,12
Industrial_and_Scientific,B00LBPSSR0,5.0,positive,"This device turned out to be perfect for my purpose.  I distill my own water.  I like to raise the pH to give the water some character.  With this meter I was able, through trial and error, to come up with the exact amount of solution to add to my water to bring pH to the desired level.  I can't imagine how many pH drop bottles I might have gone through had I gone that route.  It is a little slow to get to the final level but you can speed that up considerably just swishing it around a little.  One bonus shocker was I didn't know how high my city water pH was until I tested it.  Oh and the calibration was easy with the two packets supplied.",129,13

Industrial_and_Scientific,B00N4L5N4A,2.0,negative,"Needed this for duct work inspection, but the focal length of the camera is 5 to 6 feet away like a cell phone or USB computer camera.  So anything within 12-24 inches of the camera are out of focus.
Its really like this just a standard pinhole spy cam with a really long USB cord attached to it.  Adjustable LEDs work fine except you can't completely turn them off.  Even at their minimal setting they are extremely bright which just means harsh reflections inside anything metallic like a duct.  I assume they did this to prevent these things from being abused as spy cams so some would see it and know they are being recorded.  But that totally negates its use as a scope in a reflective environment.

Maybe I just got one that didn't have its focal point adjusted correctly or something, but as it is it won't work as advertised.

One plus is that it would work on my cell phone with a 3rd party app and a micro USB converter.  But I had to send this one back in favor for another from ebay.",187,58

I didn't want to risk installing their software so I looked for an existing program to display the video.  I found that I could use the play capture device setting in VLC to stream the video on my windows computer with no issues.

Overall I'm very happy with the camera.  I used it to track a cable through a wall.  The small size helped (the camera is TINY) as I could easily fit it through the existing access point.  The LED brightness control worked as expected and allowed me to get a good image.  I was very happy with the focus range.  It was definitely a lot more than a few inches which seems to be an issue on some of the other similar cameras.

However, at this price point? It really is hard to beat. If you are looking to read fine print inside of a dark hole, this may not be the best.

At the same time, what can you expect for a $20 endoscope . I rolled the dice and it's not so hot. My bad...I won't return it, it's $20 worth of endoscope. I'd suggest probably look at ones that cost a bit more and maybe have some youtube video's showing the video quality.

CON: The adjustable lights worked as advertised, but are so small they are not much good trying to see more than about 4-6 inches. Since I needed to see further in the dark, I taped a bright key chain type light onto the camera. That worked pretty well, but then it was hard to orient the camera so I knew which way was up.

Mine came without a software disc, but I didn't plan on using that anyways. Still the description says it comes with one so that brings the product down to 4 stars. ""UsbWebCamera"" on the Google Play store worked just fine for my purpose.

Along with this I purchased a $4 USB OTG adapter. So, I managed to connect this to a galaxy S5. Essentially, I now have a 720p camera with a 0.217"" (5.5mm) diameter at the end of a 16' cable connected to a pocket size HD display for <$25.

My wife uses it to check for ear infections/inflammation, so the small diameter really helps. We also have one that has a 0.276"" (7mm) camera. That will become my work one now, because it is just a little too big to shove in an ear...

The LED's are pretty bright and don't make the end too hot. The adjust-ability is also better than our other scope, even though it has a noticeable jump from medium to high intensity.

""I'm a fourth year veterinary student and can honestly say these are fantastic. I've had problems with my basic first year needle drivers having the lock pop all the time (typically at the worst time) or the inserts dull down. The lock is very strong on these and the inserts have not dulled or pitted. These are probably better for people who wear a size 7.5 surgical glove or higher, as they're a tad long. Some people may not like the suture scissors incorporated right behind the inserts, but i think they're fantastic.""

Putting this together you can definitely tell that it's a bit cheap, but I have no doubt that it's plenty strong for holding filament. My biggest complaint is that you can't easily swap between filament rolls. I wouldn't use this if you're running through pounds of filament every week (which I am), but it is useful for the colors that you only use occasionally. The big advantage that this has over the plastic spool holders that come with printers is that the metal has a lower coefficient of friction with the plastic spools, so the resistance is lower as it comes off the roll. Theoretically this would reduce your likelihood of failed prints, but I'm not entirely sure to what extent. I can say that I've been using it for a week and it appears to be working better than my standard plastic holder.

I'm not sure I notice much difference between the different placements as far as adjusting the damping, but removing it only leaves the one, tiny sticky dot, which pretty much doesn't damp at all.

I used a small one on my 12"" and snare, a large one on my 13"", and two large ones on my floor tom.",90,1

I have not noticed much of a tone change from larger toms, but they probably require more than 1 minemad to sound noticeably different. The ends are sticky and hook on to the side of the drum and you can place the other end anywhere on the drumhead. The damping will vary by how far or close you set the minemad.

Moongel did nothing unless you want to use three of them on one drum head.

The adhesive on the velcro dots is not very robust. So, I find myself having to reattach them too often. Not sure if it is the choice of heads or what.

The bottom / flat ends of these doohickeys have a small - 3-4mm area of sticky stuff that doesn't adhere very long to the side of your drums, so most of mine are currently on the floor, under my kit.

Musical_Instruments,B0002D0LSG,5.0,positive,"From the humble opinion of a drum dept manager, the Evans dampners are the ones I recommend the most from the 4 choices we offer. Yes, tape and gels may work and may be less money but tend to be and look messy. Especially, tape which give you no real option once they are in place and really leave a mess or damage heads when you need to remove it.
 Each dampner give you 3 options: just enough, extra dry or none at all depending on your sound.
The dots do stick and stay. They certainly do a great job getting rid of over ring, etc. And yes, they do look great.
  Find exactly where you want them, then #1and very important, Make sure to use the alcohol pad included (or get more) to insure clean surfaces. Read the instructions or watch a video or two on YTUBE. Do it right and you won't have the problems the folks with 3 stars or below have.

It's not good for trying to reverse any aging of cymbals or serious deep cleaning, you really should think of it only as a surface cleaner or as a ""brightener"". Possibly with a brush of some sort it might work better in the grooves, but generous application of the product and rubbing with a soft rag didn't seem to achieve penetration of the cleaning process into those grooves. That's probably reasonable and to be expected - anything that cleaned very aggressively may be on the border of being a threat to the cymbal surface.

The stuff has a noxious smell. I cleaned my cymbals outdoors and even then the wind shifted and I feared for the effect on my eyes. I have three cymbals (ride, crash, and top high hat) and when used generously one bottle was good for two separate cleanings of the full set.",178,3

If you are new to Tambourines, I suggest you buy a wooden mallet to use with this kind. If, as I was planning, you were thinking of getting the drum effect by striking the head with the hand, and not getting much sound from the jingles, you will be disappointed. Striking the head with the finger will always give you jingle as well. I bought soft mallets to use with them, and that didn't work, because they had the feel of a finger. Only when I bought hard wooden strikers did I get a relatively pure sound from the head, with little jingle.

Musical_Instruments,B0006LXW8U,4.0,positive,"This is a great instrument for the price.  We bought it for our family instrument collection and for our young children to use.  Much better quality than any of the ""toy"" instrument companies, and comparable pricing.  Definitely recommend.",38,16

Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,"These powered monitors are a great solution for providing accurate sound reproduction for performers in many difficult situations.  They are small enough to be mounted where you need them; up close or at a reasonable distance, (consider their size).  They can be daisy chained for like feeds.  They have built in EQ.  They have speaker outputs that are powerful enough to power larger speakers, (if you need more bass), they have headphone outputs if you cant get them close enough.  They are mic and line level compatible.  Stand mountable with the adapter.
  They are not designed to ""shake the house"" so if you don't abuse them and they'll work great for a long time.",114,0
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,Compact and easy to take to gigs. I used it as a drummer and it was great. This has all you'd want in a powered monitor.,26,1
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,"Puts vocals right there for better clarity. The only issue I have is that it is not as loud as I thought it would be. It's loud enough though.

It Would be nice if it came with the stand adaptor, even so I knew that going in. The main difference between this and the beringer model is this has a headphone jack, otherwise they are similar.",66,2

Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,2.0,negative,"I received it today. The first thing I did was plug 3 different vocal mics into it and check the sound of the monitor. Just having the volume  35% of the way up and speaking into the mic, the low frequencies of the vocal make the speaker buzz, or vibrate in the casing of the monitor. All 3 mics did that. And the Eq's were all straight up at the 12 o' clock setting, which is probably 0 db. This monitor basically does what most hot spot style monitors do. They can't handle any kind of volume and sound like AM radio. I even tried turning down the low eq to almost -10, and it did the same thing, just not as bad. I might try using this with a friend's band who is performing this weekend in a small club, but honestly, as a pro level touring sound engineer(and as a musician myself), I can tell you that I don't want to put a buzzy speaker that can't be turned up loud in front of any musician. I will probably be returning this item in a few days.",189,5
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,5.0,positive,"So far so good. I really didn't expect it to be as good as it actually is. I bought it for a few purposes. One of which was to be a personal monitor for our drummer. I sat it on a mic stand beside him and turned the volume knob halfway up and he liked what he heard. Mission accomplished. This saved us a lot in the way of needed equipment because we didn't have a powered monitor for him and had to use an fairly heavy monitor amp and passive speaker, plus a stand for the speaker. It lightened our load some, and any working band knows what a plus that is. As long as you don't expect it to sound like a 15"" speaker with 200+ watts pushing it (because that would just be silly lol) you'll like it. Our drummer can hear the mix just fine with this and we played a little on the loud side that night. One gig down with this baby, and hopefully many many more to come.",175,6

Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,"Not a full range, hi fidelity speaker, however it's very well suited for it's purpose - on-stage personal monitor. We use this daisy chained to a PM-100 for our drummer and keyboard player, both of whom sing, in a classic rock band. It has a pronounced mid-range, but that tends to deliver more volume for vocals without feedback. No problems. Bottom line: not high-end gear, but effective and good bang for the buck.",73,9
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,Enjoying it allot great for the price use it all the time and have bought 2 more. Only bad thing adjustment are on back.,24,10
Musical_Instruments,B000V8KLAA,4.0,positive,"Great monitor with a lot of flexibility.  Can be used as stand alone or to drive passive wedges.

The metal is so thin, I was able to bend it to make more of a loop for my finger, a short time later, I had a blister!  Then, the bell does not have a bell knocker inside, but a giant paper clip.  It makes noise, but it fell off mine from me ringing it so much.  So, it is a cheap price, but beware of the quality!",96,8

It came in an unmarked box, other than the shipping label, and some of the cross-beams were bent either on arrival or during manufacturing (Oh, and no instructions... Honestly, I was surprised that everything was there). I bought it for my Novation Impulse 61-key midi keyboard but my keyboard doesn't come with predrilled holes underneath so I have 2 extra bolts from the stand I don't use.

I've converted it into a straight stand until i can buy a better one. Save your money for something well built.",75,10
Musical_Instruments,B001PB42NO,4.0,positive,I've purchased 3 of these stands. I've been very pleased with the stands. I use my stand's for a home kit that I have.

PROS:
- It's designed for the Blue Yeti and does hold the Blue Yeti and does what a shock mount is meant to do...
- The holes around the edge of the mount are convenient to permanently attach a pop filter through with a nut & bolt.

CONS:
As many complain about, the knob to tighten the shock mount is absolutely worthless. When I first set it up it would not hold the Yeti straight once tightened, it just flops down. I then tried to tighten it, and the hand knob snapped off completely. Most people would have just returned the product at this point, but I really wanted to get it setup with the Yeti, so I drilled out the broken piece and took the mount to the hardware store. After getting the right size bolt and some washers and o-rings the mount is 1000% better at staying up. Thanks Ace Hardware for the Shock Mount viagra.",173,4

It's very concerning and I worry for the safety of my Blue Yeti.
I also have the Blue Pop Filter that doesn't seem to have a set home in combination with this set up. Which boggles my mind. It's ALL Blue equipment (minus the boom arm, which I have no problems with), so why doesn't it fit together?

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"The Radius is one of two available shock mounts of the Blue Yeti.  That's the reality.

Is it overpriced?  Yes.  Does it do the job?  Also yes.  However, the thumbscrew that comes with the shock mount is extremely prone to breaking.

Due to the extreme weight of the Yeti and whatever pop filter you use, the Radius will inevitably sag.  Some users suggest exchanging the plastic washers included with the Radius for the rubber o-rings from the original Yeti stand.  That is a mistake.

The o-rings merely provide a different form of friction.  Less surface area of the o-rings will make contact, and the o-rings will eventually wear out.  They will work temporarily, however.

The solution?  Get an M5 hex cap screw from the hardware store, and use that in place of the thumbscrew.  Yes, you will have to use a special wrench to tighten it -however, your shock mount will be rock solid.

I'm docking a star because the thing is hilariously overpriced.  The fixture is large, which might make it more expensive, but for a product that comes with flawed hardware.. I expect more for the price.",189,38

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"Here are a few reasons why you should not even consider purchasing this mount:

1.) It's massive. Put two pop cans on top of each other. That's the approximate diameter.

2.) It doesn't support the weight of a Blue Yeti Mic. Not only does it not support the weight (constantly swings down because the little screw can't stay tight enough to keep it up) but the mount itself weighs a ton. This makes it a nightmare for any spring-based arm.

3.) It brakes after a couple months of use. That little screw I mentioned that holds it up? Yes, it snapped off; due to, I'm guessing, constantly having to re-tighten it for the mount to stay up.

4.) Just read the other plethora of reviews saying the same thing as me.

I was lucky enough that Amazon allowed me to return the product but I'm still out $10 for restocking.",150,42

For both, the little bolt that holds the mount in place snapped off (only by using hand-torque on the bolt).  I'm no hulk of a strongman by any stretch of the imagination...  seems the weight of the yeti pulled on the bolt / joint enough to snap it...

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,"I'm very serious, this shock mount gets 2 stars because of one little screw.

Allow me to explain.

I got this mount for the same reason anyone does. Its the mount MADE for the blue yeti. That said, its huge and a bit unwieldy. On top of that, my mic was ""drooping"" every day, and so every day I'd untighten the screw, move the mic back up, and tighten it again... this process got old, fast. So finally I tightened it as hard as I could, and lo and behold, the screw snaps! I was startled, because I'm NOT a strong person at all. I looked at the screw and ITS MADE OF PLASTIC. Please be warned! This screw is cheap plastic, and will NOT hold the mic up at all! Until they fix this part, DO NOT BUY.

This isn't even shoddy workmanship, this is pure bad design and laziness. Cheapness, even. There is ZERO reason for this part to be made of plastic. Its a SCREW! Something like this should never happen.",174,44
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"It looks great but it was very heavy and made the Yeti huge. It was so heavy that it brought the stand down, no matter what adjustments I made. Ended up using the Yeti without it and I'm fine with it for podcasting.",43,45

It's very disappointing because I can't afford a different mic at this point, and the only shock mount available for the Blue Yeti is this one.

I was *very* careful with tightening the thumbscrew, but gradually over time it wouldn't hold the mic in place and it would pivot down.  I tried to tighten it tonight, and the screw sheered off when I turned the thumb screw.  I've only had the mount since 2/28/2014..  Very disappointed.",122,50

The problem is that the attachment to a tripod is so flimsy and loose the microphone will fall down immediately. So tighten it right?

Secondly, even is this thing did work as advertised, that wouldn't make up for the terrible quality. It broke a month after buying when I was adjusting it.

Do NOT buy this unless you are interested in frustrating yourself to no end.  If you must use the Blue Yeti, use a mic stand, not a swing arm.  If you prefer the swing arm, go with a different mic/shock-mount combo.

It can barely hold the Mic without falling, and I had to use a wrench to tighten it perfectly. I am worried I will strip it and break the mount. Other than that, it seems fine.

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"Works extremely well, took quite a bit of effort to adequately tighten the thumbscrew that holds the mic itself in place.

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"I want to say that I love it, but...This shock mount is very short.  By that I mean that the shock chords are short, taking very little shock away from the microphone's receptivity.  In other words, sounds do get transmitted to the mic.  The best bet is to place your mic on a thick bath towel folded over several times.  That will absorb much of the shock created from a desk mount stand.  But the shock mount is supposed to work on a boom.  I do have one set up in my studio, but as I said, it is about 80% effective.  I will say this, it's ok for the price.  If you visit a microphone store where you can see all the professional shock mounts, they can run into hundreds of dollars.  A really good mic with a really good boom requires a really good shock mount.  The professional set up I am talking about can cost from $2,000 to as much as $10,000.  If you're an interneet podcaster like me, then you don't want to go there.  The Blue Microphone shock mount works very well with the Yeti.  I highliy recommend it for the price.",197,70

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,"As another reviewer mentioned, it looks great, though it's probably bigger than it needs to be.  However, this is not well designed from a functional point of view, only on aesthetics.

This holder does not take out much vibration, which it is supposed to do.  I have 3 other shock-mount mic holders, and they all do what they're supposed to.

Unfortunately, I don't know of any alternatives for my Yeti Pro.  If you know, please enlighten me.",77,91
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,"I purchased this shock mount for my Blue microphone as advertised. Unfortunately the weight of the mic is too much for the mount and when its on a mic stand it will not stay fixed without serious torque in the screw. After one or two times of me tightening it to the required torque the screw threads gave way and now it will not stay in position at all.

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"I bought the Blue Radius shock mount for my Blue Yeti microphone to reduce secondary noise when I move near it. I was glad when it arrived, but devastated when I attempted to screw the Radius into my Yeti...

THE SCREW DOES NOT FIT THE MICROPHONE!

The screw is metric, but is the reason it doesn't work.

I chipped my microphone on the bottom trying to screw it in. I don't know who to contact to have them replace my microphone due to Blue's error.

I had to return the shock mount to Amazon and I'm afraid to order another one in hopes of getting another screw that is metric. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHOCK MOUNT!",127,96

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"Despite other users having issues, I ordered this shock mount to use with my Yeti and was glad to find out that it DOES fit the threaded insert in the bottom of the Yeti.

Pros:
- Worked with the Yeti!
- Reduced noise significantly
- Looks nice
- Feels sturdy

Cons:
- It's gigantic
- Elastic is too tight

Overall, it works well, but would work even better with slightly more shock reduction. The elastic bands are too sturdy and are still passing along some amount of shock. It's not enough to make the shock mount a bad value, but it's enough to cost it a 5th star on my review.",111,98

All three work perfectly together and the shock mount allows the microphone/arm combo to move smoothly. The only issue i had//have is that when connecting the Yeti to this mount is that when if feels like the mic has tightened all the way, there is a gap between the base of the mount and the mic itself. This problem is that this allows the move and clang and bang. I used some shims to keep it tight but, I would expect the mount/mic to be flush. I'll upload a picture to show what I mean. Other than that minor hiccup, awesome shock mount for the Blue Yeti!",123,101

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"This item was a huge disappointment. It looks nice, but it does not function in anyway like it should. The thumbscrew to lock the head at the appropriate angle is made of pot metal. I never once got it tight enough to hold the microphone at the right angle without it slipping. This could have been easily solved by putting teeth on the joint so that it would lock. After 3 weeks of trying to tighten it enough to hold the microphone horizontal the thumbscrew simply sheared off in my hand. It didn't once hold it correctly and now it is just a pile of junk that I will have to bore out and put my own hardware into. To top it off this joint attaches to the main frame with about 1/8"" of slop so that even if this joint was made tight the entire frame can rock up and down.

Basically, this is some stylized pot metal that I regret buying. I purchased a rode microphone arm with this and a Blue Yeti Pro microphone. Both are fantastic, but I hope no one else has to deal with this thing.",192,104
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,2.0,negative,"It seems to be constructed well. However the screw that joins the shock mount to the base of the Blue Yeti binds. It does not want to screw in all the way by hand, and I would not attempt to use tools to tighten for fear of stripping the threads.",50,105
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"I bought this along with a Blue Yeti, when I got them I put them on a nice floor stand put the shockmount on the stand and then tried to mount the Yeti.  I couldn't get the microphone to thread up properly, I kept thinking it was me because mic threads are pretty universal.  Before I knew it I stripped all of the threads out of the Yeti.  I currently have a service request into Blue to replace both items.  Now that I look at the reviews I am most certainly not the only person with this issue with the Radius.  However, it looks like we're isolated meaning there are some mounts that are fine and some that are not.  So when you recieve this item and you can't get the microphone to thread do not keep trying over and over, either return the item to amazon for another, or contact Blue.  I might update the rating on this when I get the new shockmount and microphone but for now I have no choice but to say I hate this item...",181,106

Yes, when you have the mic hanging upside down, the swivel mount doesn't do the best job of holding the mic in place (you have to constantly tighten the cinch bolt -- I might wind up doing some sort of modification to fix this). Other than that one issue, this shock mount does exactly what it is supposed to do.",84,111

Had to use pliers to get it on even after a drop of oil. It goes on far enough to hold the mic to where it won't fall off, but not enough to keep it from wobbling. I placed a nylon washer in the open space to fix the issue. Only bad thing is my grip of the screw is a little messed up from the pliers so its not easy to take off. Fortunately, it stays on the stand at all times.",105,114

Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,"If you are the owner of a Yeti micophone and you need to isolate the mic with a shock mount, then this is the mount to get.

Well constructed, not too heavy, but keeps the vibrations at bay.

Combine with a good boom stand... and you have a nice piece of kit.",52,125
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,1.0,negative,"For the brand and price I expected better quality.  I think they went more for style and looks when designing this.  I used it with a desktop mic boom and every key pressed on my keyboard when right up through it and into the mic.  This resulted in a slight muffled background sound that was annoying.

To solve the problem I bought a floor mic stand with boom.  This solution works great with the shock mount and Blue Yeti.

I think the problem is that the ties between parts are too small and tight.  I looked at the shock mounts for Blue's higher end mics and they are designed with longer ties.  I also used the Samson shock mount that was wonderful with the Samson mic. It has longer ties that are more flexible.  So, I believe this shock mount, which looks cool, is just flawed in design.  For the money asked, I would have expected them just to do what they know works.

On a side note...the Blue Yeti that goes with the shock mount is wonderful!",178,126
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,4.0,positive,"Hello,
Before purchasing this shock mount I emailed Blue support.
I previously had the Ringer Universal Shockmount for my SnowBall Mic.
Looking at the pictures it looked like the same shock mount to me.
So the emailed I sent was asking if the two were the same, and if i could just order the attachment piece that looked different to hold the Yeti.
Never heard back from them.
Emailed a couple of times asking the same question.
Finally just bought the Radius shock mount.
The two are the same except the piece the holds the mic to the shock mount.",100,127
Musical_Instruments,B005DVF15A,5.0,positive,"I bought the Yeti and then the Yeti Pro microphone by Blue. Wonderful mics, but the lack - at the time - of a workable shock mount, left me feeling less than satisfied. The recently released Radius Shock Mount is perfect. It fits great. Attaches and un-attaches easily. And the look is stellar - both vintage and rather spacey. I'm definitely going to buy a second one for the other mic.

Note: When you remove the mic from it's original stand, screw the attaching bolts back into the mic. Otherwise, you're left with two holes in the side of the mic.",101,128

My husband and I did not want to spend a lot of money and he ending up not liking it.  We thought this was a good start to see how well he takes care of the guitar before considering an expensive guitar.

  The bag it came with was a HUGE joke. VERY cheap and very thin.  Within a week of school the zipper on the bag broke. My husband fixed it... but it happened again.

  As far as I know nothing wrong with the guitar's sound",107,24

I should have read further warnings, as I would have saved myself time, effort, and money.  This should not even be sold as a ""guitar""!  Maybe as decor....
I bought this for a little girl, who is trying to find her niche and was interested in picking up guitar.  She couldn't even get an idea of whether or not she would enjoy playing, since NO ONE could play this thing.  With every strum, it went out of tune.  Every. single. strum.  You would play a chord three times and every strum, it would be a different note, as the crap pegs failed to do their job.  A kazoo is more of an instrument than this thing.  What a waste.",138,27

I received a guitar that buzzes at the frets, Won't stay in tune, and when we tried to tune it, the last string broke 3 times. The one I was supposed to get was a Barcelona according to the images. But I got a Crescent which is a very cheaply made guitar. I smelled chemicals coming off of it. You can tell where paint was sprayed on, and paint drippings. I'm sorry but I don't like this guitar. I do not think it was worth it. I was good at first though.",104,29

We just wanted to get something cheap, but serviceable, until we were sure they would stick with it. This was the second one to arrive. It wasn't even the guitar we ordered (came in different color). My oldest daughter decided she liked it better than the one that came for. My younger daughter, however, has a much more discerning ear, and found both to have a lousy sound. Very tinny. This model seems to hold its tune a little better than I would have expected, though. One of the reasons we bought this is that it was listed for around $20 but was originally $120, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. I think the seller exaggerated the original price to make the product look better and then offered it at a discount. Don't be ripped off. Don't buy it.",164,44

This was a bargain so I didn't think too much. It looks way better than it costs (color natural) and it sounds very decent. I am tuning it using a simple free program (it was not available when I was a kid!) and it sounds great. The strings look fine, much better and softer than I hoped for, plus it comes with two spare strings (E & B) which is nice. It lacks fret markings and the golden color on the frets is already dissipating, but who cares. The neck is super straight and the wood seems of better quality than I bargained for. The bag is made of very thin and weak material that does not look it will survive much travel, but then I am not a traveling musician. The pitch pipe is useless. The stripe looks strong and fine, I don't know why would other customers complain about it. The shipping and delivery was prompt. I am very satisfied -- definitely more than worth the money!",191,56

(how ironic right?) but you can look on youtube and and follow a tutorial on how to tune your guitar there...so its not a a really big deal. also i noticed alot of people complaining about a chemical smell ..i did not experience that. i guess it has to do with the color of your guitar or something..and also this seller says that they will give you a learning the guitar book but its not a hard copy its an email so if it doesn't show up in the mail with the guitar case just know that its not a mistake...check your email ..all in all i think its an excellent guitar for the price..,203,68

The instructor stated that the guitar did not have truss holes and therefore would not maintain the correct tune.

The only problems I had with this item was trying to tune it and trying to figure out how to attach the strap ( I only had one peg for the strap ) . The smell of the guitar , which people say it smelt chemical , was actually the smell of the wood when it has some kind of preservative so it won't rot . Overall , I am very pleased with this guitar . I really want to play it , but one of strings popped so I have to wait to get new ones . The End . K bye !",140,127

However, this guitar was made SO BADLY that the frets were in the wrong positions (some of them were a few millimeters off), meaning that it was IMPOSSIBLE to play this guitar without it sounding completely, utterly horrible. I was not able to play without having earplugs in my ears.
I didn't expect much for such a cheap guitar, but you should at least be able to play it. This, however, was painful for my ears.
Invest a couple bucks more!!",97,135

I did review the reviews about it because I knew a cheap guitar wasn't going to sound like a great guitar, but I thought it would be good enough for what I needed it for. My biggest problems with it is that it will not stay in tune. Also, you cannot tune it against itself using the fifth fret....you have to use a tuner. Even when you use an electronic tuner, it still sounds off. Now, if you have a kid who thinks they want to learn to play the guitar and you don't want to spend the money, I say it's worth it. If they love it you can always spend more of the big bucks later. I bought it because I have some people I work with who might very well put a giant hole in it with no warning.

The ebook was just some pdf file from a completely free website. Anyone can download the ""ebook"" at any point regardless of guitar purchase. [...] The pdf explains that you now own a guitar and it has strings. If you touch the strings it will make noises. Probably the most informative thing ever.

Guitar is not tuned of course. Best to have someone else tune it for you as the pitch pipe takes practice to actually use. Not exactly beginner friendly.

It's nice that it comes with the bag and extra strings because one of the strings broke when my husband was tuning it (my husband says it is common for strings to break and it happens all the time when he is playing so this is not a defect or knock on the quality).  My husband also said that it will sound a little ""twangy"" for a little while until the strings are broken in.  We almost bought a 30"" guitar but I am glad we went with the bigger guitar because I think the 30"" would have been too small for him and he is not a big child.

We used the replacement strings to restring the whole guitar and tuned it but the D string still sounds dead and the G string still will not tune and he said he believes it is because the strings are cheap strings and it needs new better quality strings. When we were trying to tune it we were using digital tuners not the pitch pipe that came with the guitar.

Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,4.0,positive,"I've had this on my gigging board for over a year and I'm really pleased with it.  This replaced my EB VP jr which broke a string during a gig and in general I much prefer the DVP3.  Sound-wise I don't notice any difference in the swell rate but what I really like is the ability to adjust feel of the pedal and the added durability of not having a string. The rubber ""tread"" started slipping off the treadle so I pulled it off and replaced it with grip tape.  Maybe it doesn't look as cool but it's better than having a piece of rubber flapping around.  The only other thing I've noticed is that it started to squeak so I put a few drops of Tri-Flow around the center support of the hinge and it has been silent since. After 10+ years with various EB volume pedals I'm not going back!",152,1
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,5.0,positive,"I bought this from another source at the same time I bought the Boss FV-500H from Amazon.
The Boss pedal is huge by comparison. The DVP3 is a much better size for me. It takes up less floor space and is very stable.
Even though they are both essentially the same pedal component wise, to me the DVP3 sounded better with less tone suck.
Of the two, this one is my favorite for either volume control or expression.
I'm back to buy another.",83,2
Musical_Instruments,B00BFYH0CG,2.0,negative,"The volume change from off to full volume is not very uniform at all. For me it functions mostly like an on/off switch.
You can modify the taper for the expression output, but not the volume output.

Also, it doesn't stay heel down by itself, so using it to turn the volume completely off is difficult too.

Shame because the pedal build and appearance is good and it looks like it is very sturdy.

Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,1.0,negative,"Noisy, made high pitched squeeling sound when loading and playing songs. Cheap isn't always a good thing",17,4
Musical_Instruments,B00P0AD6EM,4.0,positive,"First of all this is a no frills recorder there is no way to do anything to your recordings other than adjust the volume of input and playback.  The buttons can be buggy and need pressed quick and hard not held.  Upon booting up I have had the sound be very quiet like the auto gain inside the unit isn't on, restart fixes this.  The sound through the headphones has problems on my unit there is interference and other sounds so it isn't good as an extra line out for audio playback.  The recordings do not suffer from this problem however and sound great recorded at 128MP3.  Sometimes the buttons don't respond and the unit takes a few seconds sometimes up to 10 secs to set up.  Finally it only accepts 4gb and under SD cards and no SDHC.  The usb stick seems to handle any size.  This isn't perfect but it is better than the Gemini recorder.  Does the job with a little patience.",165,5

Some tests worked, some didn't - nothing recorded.  Missed several recordings because,even though it said it was ready and recording timer was ticking after hitting rec button, nothing recorded.  Not an improper wiring issue since some tests worked fine with the audio system.  No hard copy user's manual and no online manual.  Lousy customer support for this product.  I should have spent a little more and got something that actually works.",93,10

You'll notice this issue if your lights, or a variation of a color stays light/on when you turn the power off.  It's like these control boxes are not stopping all the power from going through when in off mode, so that's an issue.  The LED strings look good, the remotes look good, it's just the power/controller white box that doesn't seem to perform up to standards.  With 5 sets, we tried all combinations to make sure to rule out everything other possible component in failure.  Uniformly, it was the white little controller box that seemed to have the issue.  Not sure how to resolve this, maybe a better controller will make these use-able?",134,0

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,"Lights work very well but I have two issues:
-- Minor issue is that the remote is very weak. It only works at half the distance of my TV; receiver, or satellite remotes.
- Major issue is that the power supply connections are so loose they are constantly working themselves apart and have to be pushed back together often. Unfortunately where I have this installed that is VERY difficult and in reality should never have to be done.",78,4
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,4.0,positive,"Received on time.  Typical Chinese instructions in broken English and very fine print. Have seen similar lights for MSRP of $39  & $49 for only 1 meter length.  Remote is necessary but dysfunctional.  But hey at this price this is a bargain. Not sure if can daisy chain or not.  According to instructions no but looking at unit it looks like yes. Haven't tried yet.  They are bright, with adjustable light intensity, various colors.  Mostly used for accent/mood lighting up stairwell and behind curtains for nice effects. For this price, it is a good buy.  Not sure how long they will last .",103,5
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,Saw this for much higher prices but decided to give this a try.  Directions are typical Chinese but pretty simple to operate.  Have to plug in correctly (even knowing that I got wrong first time around) and there is a line coming out of the white plug in that goes no where.  Has pull tab for battery and takes standard lithium battery easy to find.  Have not figured it all out but it is really pretty cool item letting you change colors and pick how you want to operate.  For mood or Christmas lighting clever LED item.  How long it will last have no idea but at price I paid does not make a lot of difference.  On other sellers saw some adverse comments but so far this is working well.  Will use to replace some of my older Christmas lights next season.,143,6

This unit is the second one with the same problem.",62,10
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,2.0,negative,I found this on a one day sale for $6 and bought it on impulse.

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,Lights seam fine but I bought two of these light kits and one controller shorted between the red and green so the red led lit up whenever the green lit up.

Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,5.0,positive,"Kit came with everything needed (except for connectors if you want to cut the strip). Still going strong today. The sticky material used to hold the strip up isn't all that great so be prepared to use 3m tape or something else to supplement. The light is bright enough and can be dimmed or brightened up from the remote. Remote works well....feels super cheap, but they're all the same.

Save your money.  Spend a little more on a higher quality LED product and be happy.",68,28
Musical_Instruments,B00R6GGCK8,1.0,negative,"These are pure garbage. One of the power supplies didn't even work. The adhesive doesn't stick to anything, one slight bend and half of the strips went out. Straight in the TRASH!!",32,29

Not all the colors that are on the remote display, the entire red column doesn't work for me...except when I power off - then there's a red glow.

Sticky back needs additional adhesive.  I'm going to leave them in place, never change the color while I look for another controller box.",74,30

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,"Pros:
Sound was good
Construction was decent
Easy to connect
Charger cable included

Cons:
Wouldn't stay in my ear, had to push them in so hard that it hurt to wear them, and they still fell out
They allowed a lot of ambient noise pass-through (did not provide much background noise attenuation)
Couldn't connect them properly to my PC (maybe a PC driver issue, but don't have the time to mess around with it)
Difficult to switch between Bluetooth sources (had to manually turn one off to connect to the other, ie: phone and PC)",95,1
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,"Bad experience with these.  They connected to my phone via Bluetooth just fine, but any movement caused them to cut in and out.  I disconnected and reconnected several times, but the same result each time.  Upon arrival one of the ear cushions was missing from the package, so I had to scrounge up another one from another set of buds. The ear pieces would not stay in place and fell out of my ears constantly.  I tried different sized cushions but it was the design and/or weight that caused the issue. Can't recommend these at all.",96,2
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,"I would not purchase these again.  I've only used them three times and I've experienced problems each time.  I have static/ music breaking up even when phone is on my lap and headphones are charged.  Another issue I am having is with the left ear piece.  The little rubber part which sticks into your ear falls off when not in use.  I have traded it out with another headphones part, but it still seems to not fit.  I would recommend looking for another brand.",84,3
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,"In case you only want reviews from people who have actually purchased the item, I'm trying to figure out how to return them, never felt the need to do that before. One of the reasons that I purchased these headphone was they said they were also for running. That is laughable, they won't stay in your ears! I got so angry at these things that I had to settle down a bit before I wrote this. Every other set of in ear headphones that I have purchased has has three different cup sizes and I have never had a problem with anything falling out of my ears. Neither side will stay in, I was walking around the deck I am constructing and the sound went completely away. I reached up and both were gone. Found them about ten feet in back of me. Maybe if I duct tape them to another pair (non-bluetooth)...........",153,4
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,"These are not noise canceling, the volume is just set at a very high level. Even at the lowest volume setting on my iPhone, it is pretty loud. I could not raise the volume higher than 25%.  I had them on for 5 minutes and started to get a headache. I like loud music, but like the option to lower it to a soft level if needed. Even the female voice that announces the functions, ""Power on"" , ""Power off"", etc is very loud. Also, the keyboard on my iPhone would not function when connected to these earbuds. I tested these with my iPad as well, same issues with volume and keyboard.",112,5
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,Worked great when I got it.  Went to recharge it and won't recharge at all.,15,6
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,Very bad very very bad Th worst Headphones used,9,7
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,"The fit is great, the price is great, but this thing seems to pick up disturbance and drops the signal a little too often. Listening to music on these speakers reminds me of the days when the cool kids had sony disc players with 5 sec skip protection and had to walk around like ninjas to prevent the music from skipping. So long story short - it seems to work ok, but drops signals a lot.

Also the cable is too long and has a rubberyness to it, so it will slightly grip your skin. If you turn your head, the force of that grip may loosen the item from your ear. So you'll have to adjust it often. Just getting a tie and looping the loose cable will be good enough to prevent this issue.

I'd 100% buy again IF the thing didn't drop signal so much.",148,8

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,"They get a clear signal, nice sound.

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,5.0,positive,"Works very good for me, the battery charge works for about 3 hours, it's nice to work in the gym.",20,16
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,I received the headphones without one of the earbud pads.  They did send a new set to resolve this issue.  The headset is comfortable and I liked using it. The problem I am having with the headphones is that they lose the bluetooth connection even during a call.,48,17
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,The best NC Bluetooth headphones for the price.  Notice I didn't say the best headphones.  They don't cancel out much noise and the microphone isn't as clear as higher end headphones.  Also the range is pretty limited.  You don't want to be more than 10 ft. from your phone or other device otherwise it will drop the connection.  That being said I would absolutely purchase these again.  They are good deal.  I have a very nice Bose pair for flights with a lot of background noise and then this cheap pair for exercising and at the office.,97,18
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,Headphones stopped working after 40 days which is 10 days after the return policy. Extremely frustrated. Would have been decent headphones for the price if they still worked. I guess that's why they are cheap.,35,19

The sound is good though my phone recognizes them only as keyboard and I can't type anything with them connected. They do fit my ears but it took quite a bit of work to get them to stay in and the little bit that sticks between the speaker and the outside makes it really awkward and does nothing to help.

Overall I wouldn't recommend them unless you want this very particular style. They are just too awkward but are ok for cheap Bluetooth earbuds. If want better ones I'd spend the little be extra to go a step up which I plan to do when I can.",124,23
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,"Yes, the included ear tips are too big for my ears.  No, these are not ""audiophile"" quality.
Fit was improved dramatically after spending about 10 seconds to remove the included tips and replace with some spares I had from another, older pair of earphones.  15 seconds, back in ears and problem solved.
Sound quality is certainly ""adequate"".  I haven't been able to get a tight enough seal to really drown out other sounds and get the deep bass of a good set of in-ear monitors, but for walking around, cord-free, the sound is far better than some I've owned over the years, and I have no complaints.  A few years ago you would have had to spend significant $$ for this sound quality in a cordless headphone.  For less than $20, they are fantastic.  I can't comment yet on battery life as they haven't died yet, after probably about 4 hours of use over a few days.  Pairing is a bit of a pain, works fine w/ my iPhone, but my laptop seems to think it is a keyboard, although it still works.",183,24
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,"I tried it... the earphone buds they give you are pretty crappy... so you'll have to get New ones...
The batter life is crap, so you'll have to buy something else eventually.. or.. just... Don't plan on it replacing your current crappy device...

I'm staring at mine right now.... just sitting there... waiting to be thrown away.

I shouldn't be biased--- At first it was great... I plug them in, Charged them up-- almost wrote a great review!.... but Now, I see them... Beeping that they have low power, 20 times, every 5 10 seconds DURING my music at the gym.... Telling me in some phony voice about ""battery low"".... It's great when they say Power On, and Power Off.. since it's helpful to know... but It's like... Shut UP-- I HEAR you.. the battery is low, just be quiet and let me hear my music, or my phone call... but then they shut off...

So if you wanna keep the battery at Full, Forever... then great. but if they're used for backup-- or.. ""when you need them"" headphones-- Buy new earbud covers, and have an extra charger cord ready-- for... I dunno, Whenever you need them. Battery life isn't very good.

Hope that helps.",205,25

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,"For the price, these are certainly a great deal.  The sound is clear, the reception is good and the noise cancelling is good enough that I was able to hear my music clearly even riding on a motorbike on the highway.  My only complaint is that they don't stay in my ears - they come with multiple earbud sizes and I've tried them all, but even the one that fits the best still tends to fall out a little too often.

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,1.0,negative,Awful.  They fall out constantly and are huge.,8,32
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,"Pros:
+Bluetooth setup quick & easy
+ Uses standard micro USB cable for charging (included)

Cons:
- Comes with only one set of earpieces.  So if they aren't a good fit for you, you're out of luck.
- Sound is mediocre, at best.
- Volume control is flakey.  Inconsistent.  They work sometimes but usually don't.
-Charging port cover is flimsy and tough to open with a fingernail
- Even with the earpiece fully in your ear, the rest of the earphone body sticks out of your ear by nearly an inch.  I think this is primarily why they won't stay in your ears; too much leverage.

Would NOT recommend.  Poor ergonomics, very low quality, even for $20.",117,33
Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,2.0,negative,So far These earphones arnt the best. Their kinda bulky and it's not a clear sound at all. The base isn't great either.

Musical_Instruments,B00X3EKYV0,4.0,positive,"These earbuds are pretty comfortable to wear. They are very stable in my ears and doesn't fall out by themselves. Pairing it through Bluetooth was easy and I didn't encounter any problems. The design of these earbuds are similar to a lot of other Bluetooth earbuds.

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,"Good set, good price.  Very happy.  Been doing stringed instrument setups, and repairs, off and on, over 35 years, and these please me.",23,2
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,5.0,positive,"Can't beat this kit for the cost. Files are great, nut spacing ruler is great and mine wasn't sharp like others said, the action ruler is a nice laminate cardboard with a really cool scale design on the sides that make it easy to get a good measurement on the string, and the string winder actually is two pieces and the end comes off and has a hex for an electric drill so you don't have to manually wind. Case is great quality with some extra room so you can toss a few more tools in there.

If you work on your guitars or want to, this is a must have.",111,3

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,I asked about the quality before ordering and was honestly let down. One of the nut files is improperly marked with 3-6 stamped on the handle on one side then stamped opposite on the other side of the handle. I messed up a nut before I noticed it was improperly marked. The files are of lower quality and I'm not sure if they are gauged correctly. You get what you pay for so buyer beware.,75,6

Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,4.0,positive,Pretty good set of guitar nut/saddle files for the price.  The height gauge is nice to have.,17,11
Musical_Instruments,B00Z6QK1B6,2.0,negative,"initial Review--- the wording on the box makes it questionable, but once you look at the files it becomes clear that this set is for Acoustic Guitars! not Electric guitars. The file are definitely not slim enough to file the nut for the 1st 3 strings on en electric guitar nut.
I will add more once I have used them a bit but I wanted to get that  word out there for anyone who thinks this set will work for the great 99 dollar electric guitar kits on sale here. --- STAY TOONED,,,,,",93,12

Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,"I bought 2 of these for purposes of Skype when gaming. Microphone 1 was basically dead on arrival. Would only record the faintest of sound no matter how close I was to microphone or how loud I spoke. I spent waaay too much time trying to troubleshoot the problem, including double-checking sound card drivers etc before just trying Microphone #2. Well didn't I feel dumb when #2 worked just fine?! Anyway, my results with a very limited sample size is equivalent to a coin flip... 2 bought, I dead, 1 works fine.

50/50 not good enough for me, I would not recommend this product.

As a side-note: I paid for next day shipping on these, it took UPS 7 days to deliver them to me, they changed their delivery date 4 times. What a waste! (not Amazon's fault).I live 9 miles from the biggest SoCal Amazon distribution center..",148,1
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,4.0,positive,"I ended up returning this microphone, although it was easy to use, and good quality. I bought it to add voiceover to videos, but I didn't hear much difference in quality between using this microphone, and just using an app on my iPhone.",43,2

My kids use it to record Let's Play videos and when they play Minecraft multiplayer, and they love it.",67,11
Musical_Instruments,B0140ZEDB2,1.0,negative,I'm pretty disappointed with this product. I bought this for my child who loves to sing the minute we got it we plugged it in and it doesn't even work.

Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,"Very disappointing, it looked so beautiful in the pics, and when i got it, i felt like i was a beginner with no respect all over again, giving me something that looks like there was no care in making it, i thought it was going to be a good deal when i seen it, but when it got here, this so called ""new"" guitar, looked like crap, like a 8 year old put it together, the decal around the sound hole was a poor sticker that is falling off, there are dents all over the bottom, feels like it was made with plywood from mexico, the neck is so thick I swear only basketball players could play it with their big hands. The 'G' string buzzes, sounds like crap, this is the worst deal on here for guitars, i wouldnt send my worst enemy here for this guitar",148,2

Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,"this guitar will not stay in tune. I would reccomend it for someone that likes to fix up guitars because the finish is pretty, yet even with new strings it will not hold tuning. I wouldn't reccomend it for beginners unless the tuning problem could be fixed... it's hard to learn to play with a guitar out of tune.",59,6
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,2.0,negative,"cheap, very poorly made but for the price I did not expect much. so I guess for a beginner is okay",21,7

Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,1.0,negative,"So I was pretty excited about buying this, and though it was cheap it seemed legit. However, my friend went to replace the strings and realized that it was a nylon string guitar that was sent to me with steel strings. Of course, this bent the neck and rendered the guitar pretty unplayable. I'd definitely like my forty bucks back.",60,10
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,"I see a lot of people were expecting a miracle for under 50$, I was expecting a very cheap guitar that I could use for learning the basics of hand placement and movement. I got exactly what I expected a cheaply made product for a cheap price, and it even came with a ton of extras. Don't expect a 500-1000$ guitar for 50$, expect a 50$ guitar and you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how much you get for your tiny money.",82,11
Musical_Instruments,B016ZEWRW8,5.0,positive,"Great product for the price, strings included are cheaply made, definitely recommend purchasing better made strings and a warning to be careful in tuning these cheap ones as they tend to break in the middle and almost took out one of my eyes twice on the same chord.

Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,5.0,positive,So many things you can do with these brushes. I highly recommend them.,13,0
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,5.0,positive,"These brushes are as good as, or better than any others I have.  Not as stiff as rods and a bit sturdier than wire brushes, these belong in every drummers gig bag.",32,1
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,"EDIT: Unfortunately, these have just fallen apart.  The material that the brushes are made from is brittle and they break off at the point where they leave the handle.  After maybe 3 hours of use, I'm down to just 4 bristles on one of them.  Shame because I like the feel, but they're just so badly made, I have to go to 1-star, and definitely do not recommend anyone buy these.

I like the weight, but they're not brilliantly made.  The plastic caps from the ends fall off, and when they're fully extended, the ends of the brushes left in the handles rattle pretty bad.  The handles are a little short too.  Another 1 1/2"" would make all the difference.  But, cheap, so good enough.",125,2
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,The pair i received was VERY fragile. Slightly impassioned playing and the rods started falling out,16,3
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,Bought for fun and one of the plastic strands has already fallen out without much use. Okay for the price.,20,4
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,"They are fine brushes as far as performance goes, and for not being metal. No real complaints there. But they don't retract very well at all. Every time we try to push them back down, no matter how carefully, it shaves off part of the brushes, so that kind of sucks. I assume that after a while it won't be so bad, but hopefully this doesn't lessen the life of the brushes. Otherwise, they sound fine and work fine. The black and blue colors look cool.",86,5
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,Decent quality. Doesn't sound the same as a metal wire brush but is definitely softer on things such as a cajon or such.,23,6
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,they are brushes...and they are cheap...thats about all I can say...,11,7
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,Can there be a zero star category? These brushes are cheap and terrible!  They sound awful and arrived bent. I do not recommend purchasing them at all!,27,8
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,"Pretty cheap plastic, pieces broke off first time I used them, but what do you expect for the price",19,9
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,4.0,positive,Helps keep the noise down for my kids. They are definitely a cheap set but that is what I expected for the price. My 5 year old loves them.,29,10
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,Only got one brush when there should have been two.  The brush did not retract.  Over all - very cheaply made and not worth the time or money. I returned the item and ordered from another company.,37,11
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,2.0,negative,"Okay brushes,  but order only comes with 1, not a pair.",11,12
Musical_Instruments,B017YOQ5JY,1.0,negative,The bristles are very weak and break too easily. They have an interesting sound but they're not going to last more than a few hours. I broke two bristles off in the first five minutes and I'm not a heavy hitter.,41,13
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,"If you need a product to amplifier your music this is it. I love the BIG knob, the headphones jack, and the 3 usb ports. I love it, I use it for my computer to play video and music works well for me.",43,0
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,"This was a very disappointing purchase. This unit seems to be the perfect solution for someone who only requires an output interface but it lacks support for any sample rate greater than 48khz or bit rates other than 24-bit. It's also very quiet; almost 25%-30% less volume output than my Firewire Solo. For the price I cannot even recommend it as a Windows interface as it would be wholly unnecessary. It does exactly what is says on the box, bu the box does not give you the whole story, and neither M-Audio's website or the Amazon description mention the sample and bit rate limitations. It's possible that a firmware or drier update could correct these issues but it honestly shouldn't have to. I cannot give a recommendation to anyone in regards to this device.",134,1
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,"Extremely disappointed with this product. I was hoping for a simple USB DA with good quality converters and a little control. The interface has not program to control parameters and only works at 44khz 24 bit. When tried to switch to 48khz 24bit a dialog pops out saying it is not supported.
It might be ok for music but not recommended for video.

P.S. I got bunch of Driver IRQL Not Less or Equal M-Audio blue screens. Regardless of what USB port I had it connected.",89,2
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,5.0,positive,Using to connect to KRK Rokit 8s to my MacBook. Works perfect with Ableton. The USB hubs on the front allows me to power both of my Midi controllers and charge my phone if needed. Great purchase for a small production studio setup.,43,3

Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,Using it as a standard hub for music production and studio monitors. Works just fine for me.,17,6
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,This is my third M-Audio piece of gear and my second M-Track Hub. I bought my second one in Jan 2017 and now it's June 2018 and this is the third unit to go bad within 18 month period. This stuff is garbage. I'm really tired of M-Audio at this point and will never buy again.,56,7
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,2.0,negative,The USB ports in front stopped working a couple months after I bought it. I like the large volume knob but it sucks that I can't use the charging ports.,30,8

Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,1.0,negative,"It worked fine for a few days and then this morning I plugged in my Akai MPK mini (like I have since I got the device) and noticed it wasn't working properly, also I wasn't getting any sound out of the M-Track. Shortly after this I began to smell electric fire...it was coming from the MPK! I quickly unplugged the MPK. I tried to plug it directly into the computers USB port, the MPK was destroyed. I decided to see if it was the M-Track hub that was faulty so I plugged an old flash drive into it, it did the same thing, so I quickly unplugged everything. It's highly possible I got a bad device but I will still be cautious of M Audio gear in the future. RIP Akai MPK mini :/",134,10
Musical_Instruments,B01BYIP4IE,4.0,positive,"I chose this audio interface because all I needed to do was connect a pair of studio monitors  in my room.
Kinda wish the volume wheel was clicky, but I also kinda like it the way it is.
The USB hub is wonderful, I only wish they were 3.0 ports.. maybe in the next model?
This is not a headphone amp so don't expect crazy loud volume from the headphone out.

Overall very satisfied with performance. Looks alright. USB hub is awesome.",82,11

I like the look and feel of the phone. The buttons are big enough and the speakerphone works good.
However, when the unit is wall mounted, the LCD display is angled down, and is hard to see unless you crouch down to look at it. Of course, that depends on how high your phone jack is, and how tall you are. I bought two of these phones and both locations I put them were too low to see without crouching down.
The other problem is that three out of our four family members complained that they could not hear the caller very well. I don't know if plugging the unit into a power jack would have made any difference. I could not try that because the unit did not come with an AC adapter, plus I have no power outlet close enough to reach.

Office_Products,B0000Y7W9S,1.0,negative,"This is my first laser printer, and at first I was very happy with it. Then the honeymoon ended. First of all, the toner cartridge is fitted with a ""smart"" chip, so you cannot refill it yourself. This is, in the opinion of many, an illegal practice, as it prevents you from using a third-party toner refill. Note that the 1250W (previous model) does not have this ""feature,"" so you may be better off with that one.

Do not, ever, try to use the duplex printing feature (print on both sides) of the 1350W. If your document ends with an odd-numbered page, the resulting output is misnumbered! Also do not do anything on your computer concurrently with printing, as the driver has a very short attention span, and forgets which page it is printing.

Many one-sided pages emerge smudged on the reverse side.

Paper feeding is fair, but occasionally the printer stops with a ""jam"" message. You must open the cover and look for a sheet of paper jammed inside, but you will not find one.

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,2.0,negative,"I bought one of these coin sorters in a yard sale and it finally gave out (coins wouldn't roll down the track) so I purchased this one.  Worked fine, tested with coins dropping into the proper coin tubes.  My old one was auto start/stop and this one has a switch in the rear.  Inconvenient but not a real issue.  However, when I went to insert the preformed wrappers that came with the unit into their tubes, the penny and dime wrappers won't fit.  The bottom of the tube tapers some - probably to make it easier to insert in the machine - but too narrow for the wrapper to go all the way into the tube (top sticking out about 1/2"".  I tried with some other wrappers that I had and they had the same problem, so I really can't recommend you buy this unit.

I said it will be good to keep by my night stand so when I empty my change it won't be much so I ll use it like that.  Still jams, you have to stop remove tubes and shake it upside down to get coins out.  It's disappointing but when you only pay about 20 bucks, you get what you pay for.  On the up side, it's better than nothing.",113,58

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,Not happy with it. First thing is the description says it includes $1 coins so I bought wrappers and it doesn't have a slot for $1 coins.

Pay a little more and don't make the mistake ordering this like I did.,69,64

All you have to do as add 1 nickel after its full in the tube, an the pennies, dimes, and quarters all add 3 after filled in the machine. I'm okay with this. For 23$, I'm happy.

It is fine for my needs - I am happy with the product.",66,76
Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,1.0,negative,"Listen to the negative reviews - this sorter jams, mostly because the coins cannot generate enough momentum to roll down the chute towards the containers.

This was a gift for my teenage son and he didn't care about the condition of the box and was excited to start using the sorter. However, it was impossible to try out given that the on/off switch was broken. Through the clear smoked plastic, you could see the on/off switch shoved back inside the machine, with no way to pop it back out. I gave this 2 stars, instead of 1, only because my son really likes the idea of it. Sure seems like we received a sorter that someone else had already returned and no one fixed.",119,80

It is basically the same product but for a bit less money except for one thing.  The original machine had a button to push to make it spin when you put the money in.  This one has a switch which is either on (continuous spinning) or off.  When it says it comes with coin wrappers it does:  1 of each type.  But banks won't accept wrapped coins any more because of too many people filling them with slugs so no matter.  We bought a second one for our boys ages 5 and 7 to learn math ""money sense.""

Office_Products,B000F8SXAQ,4.0,positive,My old coin sorter had an automatic sensor when you dropped in the coins - it started automatically to sort and distribute. This new model works great - as well except it has a manual slide switch to turn the motor on after you drop in the coins. It wasn't listed with the switch as an option and there was no mention of the switch on the advertisement. It's not a big deal except now you have to wait for the coins to go thru and then manually shut it off where before with the automatic motor sensor....you could drop the coins and walk away. (not that I did but I could be doing something else within hearing distance just to make sure it shut off.),126,99

Thankfully, I had extra containers from the old ones I'd bought and I switched old containers with the new.

Paper coin tubes drop into the machine's tubes nicely and it's relatively easy to see when it's full if you read the directions.  In sorting about $85 of random coins and jammed about 5 times (mostly user error, aka impatient girlfriend) but overall; job well done.

One thing I will mention that is important... if you don't notice when one coin tube is filled and keep loading coins they will all pill up in the chute and you'll suddenly have a major problem.  Then when you take the over-filled tube out, you have coins falling down the chute and going everywhere.  Again, easy to avoid but you do have to pay attention a little.

Overall, good price and good purchase for the casual coin sorter.",148,123

This corkboard is WONDERFUL!!!  I didn't use the stickies that came with it... - I actually attached it to an old window... it turned out great!!!  You have to use something like scissors to cut it.... heavy duty ones... not a knife or carpet cutter or something like that... So I used a pair of tin snips... It worked great, cut a straight line and the pieces fit neatly into the space of the window panes... but the kicker is I used Gorilla Glue... the one where you dampen one of the surfaces - I dampened the cork.  It worked beautifully and now I have a really cool bulletin board for my new office - adding to the Industrial Chic decor already there... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!",139,12
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,I love these cork tiles!  The dark color looks great on my light walls and I like how thick they are compared to other corkboards I have tried in the past.

She tried repeatedly to re-stick them and finally used a few heavy duty Command strips which finally worked for a few.

I ordered 2 packages of 4 tiles. I could only use 4 tiles as 3 of them broke (they are VERY FRAGILE!). DO NOT HOLD THEM ON THE CORNERS! Simple gravity will make them snap in half. I accidently broke 2 just by holding them on the corners and their own weight caused them to crumble.

The other one I held in the middle and it still broke in half. They also bring a TON of cork dust when assembling.

Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,1.0,negative,I have to rewrite my review. I gave this product more stars in the beginning. The sticky pieces wldnt work so I tried gluing the adhesive  to the back of the boards.  I used two sets and put all 8 pieces together. Within a week the adhesive pieces on the top part of the cork came loose. The cork started breaking in half and my children's artwork fell while I was gone. I had caught it a couple times when I was home and was able to stop the cork from breaking those times. I wld not recommended this product.

They left a few crumbs out of the package, but now that they're on the wall, I don't see any problem, and they look very rich with the darker colouring, as opposed to the usual, more bland corkboard squares you can buy.

The first four were every so slightly lighter than the 2nd batch, so I just intermingled them when installing to make it look intentional. The 4 pieces of double sided tape enclosed is not close to being enough mounting hardware, even the instructions said to use 6 at a minimum. I bought some heavy duty double sided mounting tape from big box retailer and used about 20 1"" squares of double sided tape per board. Any less and the board may still stick to the wall, but the parts without the tape were loose and easy to bump and break off, especially if the boards are actually used and not just on the wall as a decoration. The additional tape was especially important since this went behind a dart board, so pulling darts out with the minimal mounting tape would likely have left me with many damaged and broken boards.

Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,4.0,positive,"A little flimsy and crumbly, but overall, I'm satisfied with these lil guys.  This darker brown color was a little harder to find than the standard cork, and the material is a little different, too.  As you can tell from the picture, it's not a smooth roll of corkboard or anything.  It's more like a bunch of little chunks formed together, which I think gives it kind of a neat, textured look.  Unlike a lot of other ones I looked at, these are a nice thickness making them suitable to use alone with push-pins.  They did make a mess when I put them up, and I'm not sure how well they would stand up to being taken down and remounted, but oh well.  Still worth it.  Oh -- I also attached them with tiny nails instead of even bothering with the adhesive squares.",143,63
Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,2.0,negative,"These squares are a nice color, sturdy and look nice. The major issue is there are not enough adhesive squares included with the package.

Office_Products,B000HJB9OK,5.0,positive,"The cork certainly looks like it could become crumbly if over-manipulated, which makes the fact that they arrived (all 4 sheets) in perfect condition all the more impressive: their corners were squared, and no chips or holes. I cut them to size with a razor blade, and puzzled them together around the bar section of my apartment's walls. Really adds some much needed comfort to these white walls; looks professional, and fantastic.

The provided sticky tabs are working for me at the moment, but if they do start to slip it's no chore whatsoever to hammer in some little nails. The surface is somewhat porous, meaning little nails would be completely invisible if positioned tactfully.

The back is upright and fits right in the small of my back, providing very good support.  The height, without the lower section of the central shaft, is perfect and I love the foot-ring.

After a vigorous application of WD40 and a rubber mallet, I managed to disassemble the chair and remove the shortest of the three cylinders, which still left me with a nice tall stool and let me sit in it without needing to jump.

The Bad: This is my third Lexmark x6570! My company contracts with them so until they run out of these they keep sending me more of them. The problem with this printer is simple...Poor Design. It swallows ink! I don't even pay for my ink and i'm complaining about how much ink this thing uses! I have the settings on Draft and it still goes through ink like no other! Now the ink i can Live with because the prints are actually decent but the scanner and fax!!! Unreal! Anyone who has given this printer a good rating has not used the fax for more than a page.

No exaggeration, I replaced both my color and photo cartridges at the same time with brand new ones.  After printing 6 pages of business cards (which BTW wouldn't print straight on the Lexmark, but printed perfectly on my mono HP laserjet) the photo cartridge was empty. 6 PAGES!  That's all you get folks!  Nothing cheap about this printer except for the construction.  My only other complaint is the lack of driver support.  Lexmark does not support Linux/Unix systems!

- Copying and scanning work great for my needs (personal).
- My favorite feature: automatic double-sided printing.  Hard to find feature, and I have yet to see another company offer it at this price.  What a paper saver, now I don't feel as bad when printing.  You have to change its settings in XP in order to print both sides by default.
Also, I set the default to ""draft"" quality printing by default, which saves on ink.  I haven't had to replace the cartridges yet, and the quality is fine for personal use.

Prior to a trip to the U.S. I bought this phone which I stated that was sent to the address where I would stay me, the phone arrived the day indicated

but back to my country and install the cordless charger never does not work, not charge  the Cordless Handset

2 days after i send an email to customer service stating this situation, it's been 3 weeks since purchase and I have not received a concrete solution to my problem,

I have shown that I can to return the phone to an address within the United States, However I have not received a response yet. So now I can only say that my experience with this purchase has been very, very Bad..!!

Office_Products,B003H3HBU4,2.0,negative,"The overall product is OK.  The menus are ok, it seems sturdy enough, setup was easy...  the problem is the functionality.  The speaker phone is completely unuseable.  Even with the volume cranked to the max everyone is at a whisper and even if you yell you are a whisper to the people on the other end.  The corded (another issue) hand set sits on top of the speaker and mic and you cannot turn the speaker phone on with the hand set off of the cradle.  That right there makes this item completely useless to me.  Even while using the corded hand set you have to speak louder than usual for the people on the other end but the volume if those talking to you is fine.

With an iPhone 5S I have found that the unit will not acquire bluetooth automatically and the bluetooth connection gets dropped on its own.  The whole point this is so that I can leave my cell phone put in a good reception spot and not worry about calls not ringing and maybe have the spare handset by the bed.  Not comforting to wake up the next morning and the blue 'paired' light is out on the Motorola and I have no idea when the thing dropped my cell phone.  More or less useless for that.  Calls placed out from the Motorola handset are not clear - there is static and folks on the other line have complained somewhat.

(2) The intercom is difficult to use - you have to open a menu, select a handset by pressing the arrow key a bunch of times, then select it.  This is needless.  Obviously the person who designed the user interface never intended to use it themself.

The only thing which is probably true for all pens when they're new is (for me  anyway) is to give them a little tap on something lightly a few times to get the ink down and the ink starts to flow out nice and even.
The container has a variety of different kinds of ink, from glitter to florescent to metallic and pastel to name a few. I LOVE the glitter pens since they don't get clogged with the glitter as almost every glitter pen I've purchased in the past 5 years.

The rubber feet didn't even make it out of the plastic packaging, so don't count on those staying on.  This, however, is not a big deal.  What is a big deal is that the aluminum frame is one piece with a joint at one corner.  The bends are fine, but the joint is not attached to anything and the entire frame pops off.  Sounds like a cosmetic issue, right?  Unfortunately the stand is part of the frame, so if you're planning on using the stand you'll have to figure out a way to keep the frame from springing off.  I had a board I bought from a store once that had a ""metallic"" finish that was also a dry-erase/magnetic board, but unfortunately I can't find it again.  Guess I'll have to keep looking.",145,13
Office_Products,B0052QOTGI,2.0,negative,"I bought this for displaying my band magnets at my merch table, and liked that it had an easel back.  I won't be able to use it as intended, and would not buy it again.

This board is white and magnetic on both sides (something cool I wasn't expecting) but it is cheaply made.  The complaint in the other review about the little plastic feet coming off straight out of the box is accurate for the one I received as well.  The metal frame around the board will not stay on--and it won't even pretend to.  It's like it's spring-loaded to pop away from the edge of the board.  Possibly these problems can be fixed with a little gorilla glue, but aftermarket consumer repair should not be necessary.  :-)

It also either came dented or dented very easily when I was taking it out of the package.

I was at Target after I had already ordered this item, and saw larger magnetic boards there for less money.  It would make more sense to me to buy one of those and set it on an easel stand of its own than to buy this particular board again.  That is probably what I'll end up doing.",204,14

Perfect for to do lists or whatnot. Writes and erases nicely with the Expo brand pens I have (not the pen it came with, which doesn't write well).

Cons: The marker that it comes with is cheap and completely cheesey, so you'll definitely want to get another if you plan to use this a lot. Also you'll need an eraser because it just comes with a tiny one on the cap of the marker which doesn't do the job. Also, the tiny black feet on the stand of the board have already fallen off (straight out of the box!), leaving a sticky residue in their place, and need to be glued back on.",138,15

The extender slide is positioned where my thumb won't accidentally activate it during use.  The blade is short enough to allow the package to be braced on a table to make it easier to cut.

So...this is something I feel fills a definite need. And although I'd like it better with a bigger, sharper blade (like an exacto knife), it was able to open most of the packs without problem (those very thick plastic casings didn't work very well). I think it's good to have around for general use, definitely helpful, but it may not work for -all- of your needs.",106,10

Why do companies think they need to package products like that? It's a waste.

So the safe cut package opener is supposed to take the pain out of opening those tough packages.

I tried it a few times, and it does indeed make those packages easier to open.

It doesn't work just like magic though. You've got to put a bit of effort into getting it to slice through the packaging and you've got to make a number of slices across the packages to get them open.

Possibly more safe, because only about 3mm of the blade sticks out and hardly does any damage. It is basically a worse version of a box cutter. The mechanism to slide the blade in and out doesn't even lock. So much for safe. It also does not cut through tape with any relative ease at all.

The refillable blade fell out while I was cutting which wasn't an ideal situation by a long shot. The blade is very small and not the best for thicker packaging. The plastic piece that held the blade wasn't as substantial as I would have liked. The best part is the design which makes the utility fit quite snugly and firmly in the hand.

It eventually worked on all of them.  But in all cases, a plain scissors would have been easier.  I even had trouble opening the DVD. But once a cut is made on the DVD plastic you can easily rip that open.

Cons:
I pinched my thumb skin while sliding the top button back to retract the blade.
Because the blade is so small, you need to exert some pressure on packaging materials to make sure it cuts deep enough.
The sharpness of the blade can dull quickly.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,4.0,positive,"I'm still in the process of installing two of these solar fans in my sailboat hatches so I can't vouch for their efficiency.  But, I wanted to advise new purchasers that the hole required is NOT 4.5"" or 5"" as stated in various comments here.

The instructions that come with the fan say cut a 4.5"" diameter hole using the template provided.  The template measures 4.25"" not 4.5"".  I cut a test 4.25"" hole in a piece of plywood and the fan fits perfectly with just enough slop to allow for some expansion of the fan from heat.

So, don't order that 4.5"" hole saw and mandrel for $50.  I used a $7 adjustable circle cutter that I got at Harbor Freight.  It worked fine.

I am replacing the Plexiglas hatch lenses on my boat so I have the luxury of doing this work in my shop.

The only other comment that I have about the fan is that the SS cover is not nearly as shiny as the photo indicates.

I have quite a condensation problem in my boat so I am going to set one fan to draw air in and the other to exhaust.  I'll keep you posted.",201,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000BYNGLU,5.0,positive,"This solar vent was very easy to install, and can potentially replace one meant for a 3.5"" hole.

The light is not enough to read by, but will help you see the other switches in the dark. The fan direction can be changed, and batteries are included that are solar charged and can be switch on to keep te fan running at night.

A helpful neighbor recommeneded this product & we are AMAZED at how well it worked!!!
We sprayed about 12 hours before it rained; I seriously wish I had some 'before & after' shots...within just a few days, ALL of the weeds were gone from our yard!  It was AMAZING how fast it worked!  I mow the lawn weekly on the riding mower-I am the one that does all the yard care-I sprayed almost 2 months ago & there are STILL NO WEEDS!!  Also-I can tell exactly where I sprayed, because the grass in those spots is SO green, healthy & grows beautifully!!

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000GRNOS2,5.0,positive,"When moving into our new house we didn't notice the lawn had not been kept up very well for most of the summer. The yard was full of dandelions and crabgrass. Fortunately this Ortho Weed-B-Gon is effective for killing dandelions and crabgrass. I sprayed each weed numerous times and used up one bottle on the entire lawn. It is killing the weeds and not the grass, except for the crabgrass. From the time I sprayed this weed killer on the weeds to the time they started to die was about three days. At first the plants looked wilted and then they started turning brown. I dug out all the big weeds once they started dying. This weed killer is great for when the weeds are still very young. It kills them fast and they just sort of disappear into the grass. The crabgrass seems to die a bit slower and probably needs more of this weed killer to do the trick. I'll be buying another bottle soon.

After a few uses the hook snapped.  It is made out of really cheap metal.  You expect that in a fight between the metal hook and a branch, the metal hook should win, but not so with this pruner.

You are not going to be able to take it out with you everyday to make a living or to cut down a 5"" diameter limb. But if you need something a couple times a year just to keep your property looking good, it's worth every penny of the $32.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the lock on the extension clamp. The clamp works great but you need a screw driver or pocket knife to pull the lock lever over a raised notch to loosen the clamp. I just don't like having to have a tool to operate another tool.

I was iffy about ordering them from all the rough reviews, but I'm very happy I did. Yes, they are on the ""smaller"" side, but they're working just fine at this point.

The only reason I knocked off a star is the quality of the welds. While they have held so far, they seem much more likely to break than my coated ones.",90,45

They are a thin wire and I broke a weld when I was cleaning up the garden area this fall, but that was my fault.  I used these on my tomatoes and they worked really well.

I ordered two packages when the price was lower than normal.  I am glad I paid less than the average I've seen because the build quality was suspect at best.  Several had poor welds or breaks in the wire.  One package had the three vertical supports secured at odd places leaving a huge gap on one side of the cage.  I would not recommend these.

-Great Price
-Perfect size (Same size as all tomato cages)

Every one was bent and the metal is so pliable that trying to stick the cage in the ground causes more bending. Some of the cages had bad joints that had come loose.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000NHSKRA,2.0,negative,"I am sorry to say I have to revise my review below. All 4 of the supports continued to bend under the weight of my beefsteak tomato plants, despite being tied together at the top. My cherry tomato plants did not bend the cages, but probably didn't need the supports anyway. A few of the wires broke. It is possible I didn't have enough soil in my raised bed to support the buried wires. I will try again next spring after I straighten out the spokes and use framing wire to hold broken wires together.

They did the trick. I found it helpful to 1. Make sure soil is deep enough to cover legs to the first circle for strong ""base"".  2. Tie together upper circles of other tomato plants with string to provide more sturdy support. I found that without doing these two things the supports actually bent forward on my raised garden bed.",155,135

NEGATIVES:

I do not advise getting these cages for tomatoes but great product and cheap price to support smaller plants.",84,187

In my opinion, it looks nice & for me, it is in with Irises & looks nice (you can't see the rebar) for something that can be visible by others. However, for practical use, if you only use one section of the pole with the gauge, it may just work but I'd be skeptical.

This looked nice enough so I thought I would try it out.
Well sadly this is just not that great.
One main issue is the stake it is on should really be one single piece to make it last longer.
However it is not one piece but you have to assemble it and hope that it will fit together.
Mine took a bit of work to get it to fit together right. This should not be the case with a new item.
As a result it actually did not even stay up the other day in a bit of wind and rain.
So I would say maybe not the best one to use. There are better ones out there.
It did make it during a couple rains before this last one and seems accurate.
Just did not last in the last wind we had it. Got knocked over where it connects together on the stake and cracked.
Maybe if it had fit right to begin with would not have happened or better yet if the stake was a single piece.
Not something I would suggest to anyone to get.",199,92

Attractive polystyrene cylinder holds up to five inches of rainfall and is scaled for both inches and centimeters. Shatter and crack resistant. A spiral circles the tube and adds to the look. A metal, adjustable stake holds the tube up to a height of 36 inches. I have mine in a large oak barrel planter on my back deck so is safe from being knocked over. I think, however, that placed in the ground at the 36-inch height, it might be vulnerable to being knocked over. It is rather cheaply made, and the tube sections are somewhat wobbly, but it does the job and looks nice in my planter. Despite the fragility, it is attractive and accurate enough for my needs.",138,98

However before I registered a complaint, I decided to check with my neighbor who happens to be a meteorologist. He explained that the gauge was correctly marked.

This product does not work. It does not generate electricity.
It does not even start.
The Generac XG10000E I bought online, only to avoid sales tax, was DOA.
Nobody wants to carry a 'brand new' 300lbs generator around to get it 'fixed'.
I don't either.
Apparently many of you will receive a generator that will not start.
And when this happens, the only thing you CAN do is to file a formal dispute with your credit card company.

After having repeated problems with ~4 gallons in - I added another 3 gallons of gas and it started right up.  I can't yet comment on its performance and reliability.

Following the directions set up was easy enough, although battery installation required some effort and correct sockets, etc.  The generator started right up.  Turns out there was a brief power outage the following day that served as a dry run.  Sandy hit the following month.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B0042L21B4,4.0,positive,"Pros:
1. Has a hanging loop.
2. Reads temperature accurately enough; room temp within 1 degree, boiling water within 4 degrees.
3. Highest temperature is reached fast and according to specs, in 15 to 20 seconds.
4. Has stainless steel tynes.
5. Auto feature works.
Cons:
1. Backlit light does not remain on; will require a flashlight to see temperature when cooking at barbecue..
2. Auto feature is too difficult to use because backlight is off, fork does not beep, and backlight does not flash when target temp is reached. Instead you must look for a tiny arrow to flash.
Comment
This is a state-of-the-art device. Unfortunately, the autofeature does not work as stated in the directions rendering it useless. In spite of this, the fork serves my needs, being sure fish and poultry have cooked to a safe temp. I do not need the auto features.

Everytime I've tried, at least one or two crickets would escape.... until we bought another product called Lee's Kricket Keeper. The Kricket Keeper comes with 4 tubes that the crickets naturally want to hide in so when you pull a tube out, you can get a lot of crickets at once. We now just use the tube to fill the cricket feeder then quickly close the rock.

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"I like the idea behind this feeder.  It feels substantial.  It looks good.  But it has significant flaws.  The stopper doesn't fit, and requires modification to make it useful.  Probably best to just get an appropriately sized rubber stopper at the hardware store.  But the biggest problem is that it does not have a means to lock it closed.  This may not matter too much with smaller lizards, but our full size adult bearded dragon figured out where the crickets were the first time it was used.  Why sit there wondering if there are more crickets when you're a dragon?  Just shove the rock until it splits and then you get all the crickets at once.  (Never mind that calcium and vitamin dust go everywhere in the process).  So while refrigerated crickets are easy to load into an opened cricket rock, warmed up crickets are even easier to get out (if you're a dragon) by kicking the rock open.

Add a reliable locking mechanism and a stopper the fits and I'll be a customer for life.  Otherwise, buy with caution.",180,8

Every morning we place 3-5 large/small crickets inside  (covering the peep whole every time we fish out crickets from their storage container).  After turning the rock carefully upside down and shaking the rock side to side in a gentle manner, they get fully coated with the calcium.  The crickets play inside for a short bit while getting coated with the calcium powder. The goastly looking crickets come out fully white playing peek-a-book for a short bit (while the dragon eyes the whole patiently waiting for its future meal to pop out.  It makes for a very happy ""and healthy"" dragon at play with his/her food.  Baby bearded dragon also likes to climb on the rock and rest a bit.

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"I purchased this item thinking that it would make it easier to feed my baby beardies but it definitely made it harder. Usually I purchase about 200 crickets and keep them alive by giving them the orange cubes, but for whatever reason they started dying quicker. The very first time I used this to powder the crickets, my beardies were so happy. It was like a buffet. The only issue is getting the crickets IN and not WASTING them. The crickets were jumping out as I was putting them in, the used this to climb on top of to jump out of the beardies cage, and when I opened it to change the powder out half of the crickets were dead inside though i had only put in a few at a time. I guess for someone more experienced with this item, it could work how it is intended but for me it made a huge mess of powder and dead crickets. I wouldn't recommend it at all.",168,18

In my opinion its made upside down as you have to keep the lid (which has the logo, trademark and writing facing upwards) on the top or any movement and you spill all the crickets out.

Anyways put all 12 in, let a few escape, he ate and then i put plug back in.  Went back 2 hours later and all crickets are stone dead inside. Do not leave the crickets in like others have said in their reviews. Waste of money and time to us.",119,21

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"I bought this on a whim, and I have to say, I am pretty pleased with this purchase. It gets the crickets perfectly dusted, and it helps control the flow of the crickets coming out. My dragon sucks at hunting, so this was ideal for him. If I dropped them in all at once he would lose interest and not eat them, but some days I wouldn't have time to individually feed him until he was done. Now he sits by this rock when he's hungry and makes sure he gets every single one! Also helps with me not wasting as much calcium/multivitamin dust as I was before.",108,24

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"First off, you will need a cricket funnel scoop, Rainbowmealworms has them for 7.50, linked below.

Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,This is totally worthless. First the bottom does not hold on to the rest of the feeder. When you go to pick up the feeder you must hold on to the bottom or you will have all the crickets that are left going free. Second how do you get the crickets into the feeder? Every time I tried the crickets just climbed out. It took some time to get even a few to stay in long enough to close the lid bottom. The few I got into the feeder never came out.

After working with this gooseneck for a while having it slip off the edge of my table while drying a dog I decided a change was in order. I have a metal edge on the perimeter of my grooming table.

I removed the bottom clamp from the arm and after purchasing the correct length hex head 1/4-20 bolt I mounted the arm to the table by bolting it from the underside.

The doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker, so did that golden, it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose (my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard, would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile,)

We've already had many hours of fun with fetch and tug-o-war.  I totally recommend this product! Though it was chewed a bit, I am very happy with my purchase and plan on buying the smaller size for my small dog.  The seller also has great customer service, so that's just a huge plus!  If your debating on if you should buy this, let me make the decision for you, buy it!",178,19

It got one star cuz that was the lowest I could go.",32,62
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,My cats think this is stupid and want nothing to do with it.  They will not walk under it or even rub up against it.  The little furry ball that comes with it comes apart way too easily.  One of my cats had wads of it in his mouth within seconds.  I was afraid he was going to swallow it and have a big problem.  The catnip coating is very light and really doesn't affect the cats.  The carpet portion is like velcro and harbors tons of cat hair.  The hair embeds itself in the fibers and won't even vacuum out.  This was really just a waste of money.  I'm glad it was inexpensive.,114,63

Disappointed in this purchase.,70,107

We've had it for about a week now and neither one has shown an interest in it. It's big enough for our 17 pound cat to fit through, and well enough made. It has rubber nibs on the inside and outside of the arch to rub against, but so far no activity. We're still hopeful that in time one of them will give it a try.  If not, I'll give it to a friend who has little kitties. They'll play with anything!",108,129

It's well made, and easy to assemble. The carpet is a different pattern than what's pictured, but that's not something I'm worried about. She loves to sharpen her claws on it, and occasionally I clean a clump of hair off it. That's one less clump I have to brush, so I consider it money well spent.

This fit our puppy perfectly, and though she pulled hard to twist around in an attempt to chew on the leash (and managed to reach it, too!) it didn't unfasten. I confess I removed the little bell (as I fear it may have been alarming her) but even that was an easy process. The vest which arrived was a lime green, almost yellow. Very cute.

I would definitely buy this harness again.",135,4

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,Purchased for my Netherland Dwarf rabbit who is only 2.7 lbs. Based on reviews I got the small. However this was way too small and didn't come close to fitting under his belly. Right after removing it from the package the nylon frayed and the belt clip fell off because there was nothing at the end of the nylon to hold it on. The rest of the harness seemed ok. I will be looking for a better quality item to purchase.,81,12

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,1.0,negative,Worst ferret harness ever. This is an H-type harness but only the neck has a clip. The body section is only weak Velcro. The clip tightening strap easily comes loose and my ferret wiggles out of it in seconds. Leash is also a foot too short and the hook feels really cheap.

Yes, I actually got out the tape measure and measured the size of our pig's neck and body. Our pig has a neck of 8"" and body of 10"", which they say should fit the size M.  Nope, it was WAY too small and I had to return it. I'm debating about trying a size Large or X-large because I know my daughter would like it (I'm not so sure if the pig would actually like it though). It looks to be well made and soft, but I gave it low stars because of the misrepresented size.  I also wish you could select the color you get, rather than having them send you a random color.",133,41

I bought a red one for my male ferret and it fit perfectly, however, I bought a pink one for my female ferret and even the small was to big and she was able to slip out with ease :(. I'm not a big fan of the actual leash either. It's a sort of bungee material but it's easy to get another leash to attach to the vest. Another problem I had with the pink vest was that the ring you attach the leash to kept coming off but this didn't happen with the red one.

Then I asked if those hardest things are good for little piggies. Apparently the back bones that the guinea pigs have aren't fit for guinea pigs, hence why they also don't have running wheels like most other little animals. Even though on the package it says for guinea pigs the store clerk said that just to get the harnest's to sell, because if you've ever noticed the little hunch guinea pigs have in their back, then yeah you can see those harnest's aren't for them.",107,126

I have purchased a number of these vests to help with kitten and cat training and the tabs that go around the body of the animal were always soft so as not to irritate.  That is not the case with the extra large size - the tabs are too short and the Velcro is very stiff and is squared off and will irritate the animal as it moves.  I am going to see if I can fix this as the soft mesh material is wonderful.  I'm glad I didn't buy more.  Returning it would have been a hassle. Too bad.,110,188

The waist opening (9"") is also smaller than stated, although I could stretch it almost to 10""-again too tight for the stated waist size.

I have used a similar harness for our Holland Lop escape artist rabbit.  If the harness was the size I needed, I would be very happy with this new one I purchased.  It is not the size I was lead to believe, so my other child has a new leash for the stuffed animals. Not a total loss.",143,205

Its still a bit tight so I wouldn't get this for an animal any larger than 6lb.

Hopefully that won't be the case of me loosing him,70,218
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,I love the idea but the way this thing is designed puts the front of the harness around the animals neck. In order for them to not slip out it needs to be a little tighter too. Felt like I was choking my animal. I wouldn't recommend this design.,49,219
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,"The company that shipped the product was professional and cared a lot about customer service. The product itself was well made, and it did its job well enough. My problem is with how it was designed. The product is supposedly designed to fit both ferrets and rabbits, but I found it to fit my rabbit very uncomfortably.

I had the adjustable neck strap as tight as i could get it, while I had the adjustable torso strap as loose as I could have it. It was still too tight around my rabbit's torso and loose enough around her neck that she was able to squeeze out of it a little at one point. I think it leans a little towards fitting ferrets, rather than a rabbit. I thought that the adjustable strap would make it possible for my rabbit to grow into a little bit, but she completely grew out of it in a week because of how tight the torso strap was to begin with.

If you have a ferret, it is probably a great fit. With rabbits, I suggest waiting until they reach their full maturity before getting one.",191,220

Its too small for a rabbit (unless you have a very small breed).  Even the XL would be too tight on a larger breed.  If you want one for a larger/heavier rabbit, I recommend looking elsewhere OR simply sew on more Velcro to the straps (it works great and still keeps them secure!).

For my rabbit though, this is a great harness!  The material seems strong and has a little stretch in it for comfort.  I was worried about the neckline, but she didn't have a problem with it.  It didn't constrict her.  The slip around strap on the neckline gives me added security.  She hopped around quite happily.  The leash is short though (just pick up a longer one at the petstore or the dollar store).  I cant imagine her being able to slip out of this harness.  I couldn't beat the price or the quality.

If you have a large breed you may want to consider buying it in person at a store for easy return if it doesn't fit.  It does run very small.  But it is a very nice harness.  Fairly easy to put on and he seems comfortable in it.  He has never managed to escape from it, but is a very calm bunny and doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  The leash isn't that long, but I feel like that gives me more control of the rabbit, though don't expect to be able to walk a bunny like you would a dog.

It would work for a very small dog who can scamper up a steep incline but not by a dog which has any medical issues.,83,14

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,Wouldn't recommend because it doesn't hold stable to anything.  You have to brace it with your foot to keep it from moving while you use it.  Depending on what you are trying to do; that's not very convenient.,38,26

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,5.0,positive,This is great ramp because it is one-piece and lightweight. I use it to help a senior Yellow Lab get in and out of my car.

Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,4.0,positive,The ramp came quickly and it is very sturdy. I have a subaru outback and it BARELY fits in the passenger door. I have to anchor it with my foot at the bottom so it stays put so my dog can climb into the back seat. I probably will try to put something along the bottom so it won't slide.! It would be great for a van where the door slides open instead of just opening.,76,38
Pet_Supplies,B000T9SDHE,2.0,negative,"This ramp did not secure very well to my stairs; therefore, it wasn't safe for my pets to use.  The width of the ramp was good which was what attracted me in the first place but I had to return it because it didn't fit well.",46,39

My dog is medium sized (50 lb).  Maybe it would work for small dogs.  I would not recommend this ramp.  I ordered a ramp with removable carpet from my local pet store and it works great.",96,42

Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,4.0,positive,Most effective product I have found.  I used it on an outdoor tree that one of my dogs was found of eating.  I have both a large lab and a small Aust cattle dog.  Both were curious at first but neither were found of the smell and left the tree alone.  Product is also effective at repelling humans - I gaged nearly each time I applied it.  I did not try the product indoors thus I do not know what lingering influence it would have on people.  Largest downside I see is the need to reapply occasionally.  I reapplied to my outdoor plants once every 10 days.,107,1

I sprayed it, reset it, and resprayed all of the other ones again. This does seem to work.",77,5
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,5.0,positive,"Awesome stuff, it stopped my puppy from chewing on the molding around the floor (knawing off our paint and huge chips of wood), our wooden chairs, and anything else we didn't want her destroying. I also recommend telling them 'no, that's not your toy', and then giving them one of they're toys that they're allowed to chew on and say 'chew on your toy' to help redirect that behavior. It's natural for dogs and especially teething puppies to want to chew on things and they need to have something they can chew on, but this spray really helps to let them know what they can't touch. It's really powerful stuff, definitely hold your breath when spraying it (a mask would probably be better) because if you breathe it in while it's airborne it will linger in your mouth and it tastes HORRIBLE!!",142,6

Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,This was ineffective in preventing my dog from chewing things. I ended up buying cinnamon oil (food grade) which finally did the trick.,23,11
Pet_Supplies,B000WFL1H4,1.0,negative,"Alright so I tried this on two of my pets - a shih tzu and a miniature pig. I mainly bought it for the pig as there was a spot of carpet she had been picking at lately and I wanted to discourage it before it became a problem.

Well, this stuff arrived and I figured I should test how good it is - or rather how bad it tastes? Both pets generally take anything from my hand that I offer and then spit it out if they don't like it so for my test I tried a plain old scrap of paper. Sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu. He ate it and then asked for more. Then did this with the pig as well. Same result. They both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was I going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff. I repeated the process once more to be sure. I then put some on my finger and they both licked it clean.

Needless to say I decided not to spray it on my carpet since both of my pets seemed to love the taste.",201,12

I used to live in an apartment complex so my two dogs would play with about 10 other dogs daily, it was a dog oriented community and we loved it. Of course they got a lot of fleas within the first few days, bad enough to where there were fleas in the house and in my bed, so I had to try something. I didn't want to pay the outrageous $40 for the good stuff, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I have one dog who is about 15 lbs, and another who is about 35-40 lbs. So I got this to use with both of them. It was amazing. Within a day, if not hours, all the fleas were GONE, from my pets, my house, my bed (thank god!) and the product actually smells pretty good. An orangish, citrus smell. My dogs don't like when it's applied but I think thats because they don't like the squeezing noise when you apply it. overall, great product. It's the only thing i will ever buy in the future, plus it's a great price!",201,6

I did not use quite as much as recommended, rather gave my dog a really good flea bath and made sure she was dry before applying the product.  I haven't seen a single flea since and the dog had fleas pretty bad. I think it is important to mention I took several days to clean the house from top to bottom with borax & bleach and put a cheap flea collar in the vacuum cleaner bag in the days  immediately after recognizing I had a flea problem.  I wonder reading the negative comments if fleas infest the house if any product can be effective.

It would have been better it fit and stayed on in one place, but it goest flap flap flap.

Outside, they tend to slide around until the tread is on the top.

The only complaint I have is the measuring system.  These were an X-Small, and I measured as the instructions said to, but they are still quite large on her.

One nice touch I noticed was a pad sewn into the inside on the upper part where the velcro wraps around the leg. It makes it a bit more comfortable for him when I wrap those velcros around his ankle.

Instant Immersion is not immersion, it's mostly memorization (more so than Rosetta Stone). This is not a product you could really learn the language from. I'd say it's best use is for a student in a low level Spanish class to get a little more practice.

Also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp. for instance ""azul"" becomes ""athththul"" or ""azcar"" becomes ""ah-ffffu-cah"".

This product compares to Rosetta Stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak.  This is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list.  Perhaps that's worth the money, but don't confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from Rosetta Stone.  My problem with RS is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary.  So in that sense, this would be a nice complement to RS.  The audio CD's included in this are actual lessons, thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing.  It's really not comparable to RS at all, and any comparison is incredibly unfair.  They should take those claims off of their packaging.

I am a Spanish and ESL teacher. I have used both programs. Rosetta Stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face. You will be fluent in any language after using Rosetta Stone.

However, this ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" program does not use immersion. It teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other. You can quickly progress through the CDs without learning any grammar. How can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences?

Well after you waist $40.00 on this product and try ROSETTA STONE you'll find out what I am talking about.

Level 1 in Rosetta Stone will teach you more about the Spanish language than a few CD's in this cheep program. Why do I need 3 CD's to teach me the numbers 1 through 20? That's rediculous! Not even my four year old is interested in the program.

I honestly can't reccommend this product unless you need just very general representations of topography. Garmin offers higher-res topo maps but only for very selected areas in certain USA parks.

I would think that if Garmin was going to force us to by their maps, they would make an effort to improve them!

It is a great addition to the tools that GeoCachers use with plenty of detail. I was also surprised that many of the better known trails (especially in state and national parks) are marked on the maps. However, it's easy to get spoiled by that and I find myself wishing more of the trails were marked.

I still feel that this software will exceed most people's expectations. My state of Virginia takes up about 36MB of storage on my GPS, so to store a whole lot you'll need a GPS with a lot of room. I loaded mine with just the areas I frequent the most, and any planned GeoCaching areas as the need arises.

Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,"It wasn't easy, but I finally got my US Topo software installed so I don't have to mess with the CD's.  Garmin needs to get on the ball and make this the standard install.  Basically, you need to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all the files from disk one into this folder.  Using the ""Copy"" command from the drop down menu won't work, so you have to work around this issue. On the second and third CD, you will create subdirectories in the folder you created called ""East"", ""Alaska"", and ""Hawaii"". Once done (it will take a while), do the setup command from the folder you created on your hard drive.

I had called Customer Support for a little assistance with this issue and after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I discovered that the Customer support at Garmin SUCKS! I love the GPS, I love the software, but the customer support is a total waste of time.

If you don't need the terrain detail of the 24K series, give USA Topo a try first.

The one thing I am disappointed with is the program's insistence of having the CD in the drive to work.  This is quite annoying.  MapSource City Select and USA Topo 24K both allow you to install all the map files to your heard drive.  USA Topo should too.",129,47

This is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your Garmin unit, other software claims to work with your Garmin GPS, but they only download/upload waypoints.

When pulling waypoints/routes/tracks from the GPS unit Mapsource always opens up a new map document, you can't import into the map you have open without copying and pasting. This is probably the most overpriced, counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since MS Office.

Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,"This product is what it is. It isn't a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it. It is a basic set of TOPO maps that shows most local roads. What do you want for under $100 for a set of maps that covers the entire USA? It doesn't have every street name, the water maps are a little sparce, and some of the feature names are dated. I bought, I like it, I use it for what it is good for.

Bottom line is that this is a tool like any other. You wouldn't build a car engine with nothing but a $5 pair of pliers but you could. You can mow your entire lawn with a $29 string trimer but you wouldn't. This is a basic $100 set of maps of the entire united states, for the price you can't beat the detail.

The trail detail is that it will give you a point! I hope at least the trail is crossing it!

But one use I've found is this...some points of interest are not in the GPS V base map, nor are they in the V's City Select software.  So I simultaneously load the TOPO software, and presto, I can pick out the TOPO's points of interest...set a waypoint up...then route to it via the City Select map.
It works fine, that is unless you're finding a place which doens't have a road, but for driving to trail heads, and other TOPO type features, it's helped me.

It worked as well on the GPS as it did on my PC, and again I have no hesitation in recommending it.
Perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with United States Geological Survey topographical maps or other navigation aids, so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed.

Purchasing Garmin software used is a pointless exercise in disappointment.  If you're going to buy them, you need to buy them new.

You cannot print out just an element of the scrapbook, other than ""stickers"" without printing out an entire layout.  So, if for example you want to use one of the few borders that comes with the program, or have the time to tweak shapes into borders or mats or whatever... beware.  You must print the whole page.  And you can't export images either.  This is basically a limited, unflexible clipart program that might be good if all you want is to design for the web using the few choices of graphics they have.  Otherwise... stay away and save for a ... ""real"" scrapbook program. (I haven't tried Hallmark)  Keep scrappin.  With scissors and paper if this is the best there is out there.",143,6

Three is close, and as far back as I am willing to go, although you cannot extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages.
In four, you can create JPEGS as well as PDF's of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive. It took me all of a half hour before I had my first page done. Showing people the ropes of the software (I gave version four as a Christmas gift to a few people) took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own.

You can get a copy of four for about 20.00 more than this version and I feel it it well worth it. Many pages I have done, people think were done with 400.00 photoshop.

I've clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest.  No luck. (Even the tutorial is non-interactive). Additionally, pages cannot be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste.  Further, each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects.  The help section is also very basic.

One good feature is that the photo editor seems pretty simple to use and does a fairly decent job.  Additionally, no problem running this w/ Windows 7.

After all, you can't learn to conjugate verbs or understand the ""gender value"" (mostly foreign to native English speakers) attributed to the nouns and their relative verb conjugations if you have never heard the nouns before.  It is a very complicated thing, Russian and Ukrainian.  If it came in a pill, everyone could take one!  Too many courses go way too fast by talking about the possessive of a certain female pronoun adjective (huh?)- but this one is just the right speed- slow and simple.

If you feel you are weak in numbers, time and dates, then it is worth the cost to learn them.  I found that I'm very fast at numbers as a result of this course.  By itself, the course doesn't do much, but for the specific area of numbers and time, I can't think of a better way to learn.

I live in a neighborhood that was built almost ten years ago and in Street Atlas 2004 it still didn't have my neighborhood in it and I live near a major city.

There are some inaccuracies with the POI's as others have stated, but they aren't so far off that you couldn't find them with a little looking around. At least with them marked on the maps you get a very good idea where they are.

Web based maps are good to have, but when you have to travel to several locations in a day its impossible for me to get online to find where I'm going. With this in my vehicle I can get where I'm going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks.

Others have had this same problem, as related on the Delorme forum, so it isn't just my computer, or my installation technique. Every other Delorme product I have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem.

I have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply (after five days). On their forum I was told to follow the instructions for a so-called ""clean install,"" but when I followed them (three times!) I got the same result.

Microsoft's product is static, or ""dead"".  Connected to a GPS, it will show you where you are... but don't expect it to think ahead.  I've used it numerous times and it had been helpful because its an accurate MAP and shows where you are, but that's it.

Newer versions (tested up to 2008 as of this review) do not install and/or run well via Wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored, street-level navigation in linux.

If you want updated cartography and new, handy features, go with a newer version. All versions of Delorme Street Atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag.

Software,B0002IP3KM,2.0,negative,"Street Atlas 2004 has a problem that if the version of Windows is not English or if the user sets languages other than English as their default language set on US version of Windows, SA 2004 does not work at all.  So, I have to change the language setting of my US version of Windows XP and reboot the computer every time that I need to run SA 2005.  It was so cumbersome and I wished that this problem is fixed in SA 2005.  However, SA 2005 has the same problem and it seems like DeLorme does not care about this problem at all.

If you are a user who uses different language setting on Windows, you should try Microsoft Streets & Trips instead of SA 2005.  SA 2005 has better GPS capability than MS S & T, however, my choice is S & T for this reason.

Another thing is that there is misinformation on the product's box: it claims that Delorme includes major roads and highways in Canada, while its competitors don't. The fact is that while Delorme only covers major Canadian roads, Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2005 can generate detailed maps of Canadian streets just as what it can do about U.S. addresses. Microsoft's product can produce driving directions in Canada too, which Delorme cannot do.

3. It doesn't locate my location precisely with GPS.
It claimed that i was driving on a freeway when i was actually on a local road next to the freeway.

Oh, and if that's not bad enough, when you want to send an invoice by email, it doesn't use the invoice template you've created.  Instead it generates an uncustomizable email in plain text which looks like something from the early days of punch card computers.  Also, remember those customer accounts you created in Money?  Well the invoice doesn't pull in the customer information!  That's right, you have to use a different form to enter the customer billing information (again) for invoices.  Terrible product.

I had a Magellan Meridian before, which would only display elevation lines.  The Garmin with TOPO produces a similar appearing display, with perhaps more detail as to water features (streams, lakes, etc.).

As far as preparing to write to a Micro SD card a ""Core 2 Duo 6300"" took 6 hours to prepare a single 8 min write. ""Quad Core 9550"" more than 4 hours. More than twice the estimated displayed. Also firmware update for Etrex and 60CSX allowing a 4 gig card, not quite enough capacity for CA NA OR WA 24K. I made a special card part City Navigator NT part Topo 24k. City Navigator NT disables elevation lines when active.  California is two map files on NT (from map, hit menu, select setup map, check or uncheck NT map for your city needs). Topo 24K is a separate map file for a zillion USGS Quad maps. By the way, even the older City Navigator maps cover some roads in Death Vally that require experienced 4WD operators (Stripped Butte Valley Rd).",178,42

I specifically bought the 24K map version because it has routable trails.  The problem is that the map is missing a LOT of trails.  For example, in Mt Tam, Steep Ravine is not included.  Around Santa Cruz, all of the trails that make up the Skyline to the Sea trail are missing.  These are major, heavily used trails and having incomplete trail information really limits the functionality of the maps and the GPS unit for hikers.  I have heard that the 100K version includes all of these trails (albeit with less contour information).  I'm really pissed at Garmin and will probably be returning these maps.",126,43

Also, in Washington State near Shelton there is a campground known as Brown Creek. It shows this as being in the National Park! It is not! It is in the National Forest.. This is a big deal if you are a hunter! It is illegal to hunt in the Park but not in the Forest.  I have found many areas where the Olympic National Park is listed inaccurately.

Even on the Vista, the contours are such that I can use them for ""bushwacking"" if necessary.  I compared this to the free one that a lot of people use and there is no comparision.

Sure you can look around online for free, compatible, download-able maps from online sources but I found I couldn't always get the coverage I needed from free maps.  Simply put, if you're going to be using your GPSr for anything outdoorsy, on the ground, in the western states of Washington Oregon, California or Nevada just suck it up and get these 24K TOPO maps.  Not the 50k:1 or 100k:1 ... Get the standard of the realm 24k:1 TOPO maps.  Then learn to actually READ a TOPO map if you don't know how.

Garmin provides two, free to download, guides for using a GPSr.  One specifically covers using your GPSr in conjunction with a paper TOPO map.

How can these maps be trusted in areas one does not know? That is unless you don't mind being lost in the Forest.

Go to farm road CO123 (12 miles).
Turn right on I25 (43 miles)

In any event even with incorrect trail and a GPS you can easily see where your are going and whether the trail is leading into the direction you would like to go.

Amazon's price is much better than most others, but still very high compared to maps for GPS units from other manufacturers.

An important tip:  this will only update *one* Garmin unit, keyed to the unit's serial number.  Shortly after installing this map, my Garmin had to be replaced because I accidentally damaged the touchscreen.  A quick call to Garmin after I received my replacement unit had them reassign this map update to the new unit's serial number so I could load it into the new GPS.  Good service from Garmin!",157,28

This reminds me of the days when software publishers overpriced software and got rigid with copy protection schemes.  They stopped more legal sales than they stopped piracy.  Eventually software publishers got more friendly about both prices and second installations, with lots more happy customers for their efforts.

Garmin should have allowed me to use my $60 map update on both Nuvi's (or made it cheap enough I wouldn't feel so ripped off).  Now I am just ticked off.  Next time, I'll try Tom-Tom.  (Or wait for a decent Iphone app.)",153,29

With a GPS puck (not included), MS MapPoint becomes a great GPS for salesmen, delivery men, and others who need to map out their day in order to visit several points in an efficient manner.  Most GPS devices fail in this regard (they work great from point A to B, and could include a detour, but forget about going to ten locations).  It would be great if MS had a self-contained GPS device (not a laptop) which could be programed with the information generated from MapPoint (by using a PC as the user interface, it makes data entry far easier than a small touch screen).

We do not need the wayfinding function, so having that is of no value.

We use the territory function to highlight market areas by County or ZIP code.  That works okay, but is a little cumbersome.  I also find transferring a map to Word or PowerPoint documents to be more difficult that it should be.  SmartDraw is easier and it isn't even a Microsoft product.",131,7

The improvements on MapPoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor. Pushpin management has been overhauled, and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from. Map Settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation. Also, you are now able to import / export .gpx files, making for easier data sharing. If you need new features like these then by all means, I would recommend purchasing MapPoint 2010.

What worries me considerably is that Microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application - Bing Maps. This application is only available direct from Microsoft, and the cost varies with the number of seats you license.

That makes me wonder how long MapPoint will be available, and whether Bing Maps will be a better program.

I have been a Quicken user for my personal account since their inception but I am greatly disappointed in the  Mac product. I assume that this is due to not selling as many Mac versions and therefore less time and money were spent on developing it.  There are extra steps necessary in the Mac products more so in Quicken than in Quickbooks.  The reconcile is also an example of an inferior product.,91,20

When I customize a report, and save it, the report column widths are not saved.  So, each time I run the report, I have to adjust the column widths.  Also, when entering a transaction in the register, if the payee exists, the details from the last transaction will automatically be copied to the current transaction.  If there is no detail to the transaction being entered (i.e. no split), it's not intuitive to go into the check itself to check that the memo line has not been overwritten by a detail memo line transferred from a previous transaction.  The result - incorrect memos on checks.

Along came one of my good friends and colleagues with a gift of my very first MAC a MacBook. I went from total despair to ""why the heck didn't I do this years ago"". Anyway I am know 100% MAC. Luckily Intuit has understood that migration from PC's to MACs is an ongoing phenomena which will not slow down. I started using QB for MAC as soon as it came out. It makes bookkeeping sooo easy, neat and quick. I should know, I am an accountant by trade (CPA). I've used heavy duty systems and other light versions. QB MAC is, hands down, the best!!

First to upgrade my Home and Business Data to Quikbooks PC, and then the PC files could be imported to Quickbooks for Mac. This did not bother me, but after running Quickbooks on Mac for three years, I am totally frustrated. The program does not operate with anything close to the ease and convenience of the PC version. I Have purchased every new upgrade, and yet, nothing has addressed the issues I have with the software.

Software,B003YJ8WFE,2.0,negative,"QuickBooks is the standard, right? So I followed the crowd and upgraded every couple of years despite the ""They want HOW MUCH?!"" expense. The only problem is that the every version is worse: It's more confusing, does less that's obvious and easy for someone whose skills are NOT in accounting, and the Mac version never did want to sync with my bank or credit cards. The end result is that I used it as little as possible, and thus my small business' accounting data was perpetually out of date.

When I started my new solo company, I signed up with FreshBooks instead. It updates things immediately, it stays as simple as I need, and the data is up-to-date without a lot of effort. See ya, QuickBooks. I won't miss you.",130,228

While you don't need to have formal accounting training in order to use this program, it probably wouldn't hurt to have access to a real accountant if you're completely without experience.  We thought we were doing a good job our first year until it was tax time and our CPA made us aware of possible problems/issues that needed to be resolved (by no means a result of the software having been faulty; just improper use/understanding of its use on our end).  It took a good couple of weekends for us to get everything straightened out and we did end up hiring an accountant for a few hours just to help give us some guidance and direction moving forward.

I don't know any Spanish and this software is a perfect starting point for us.  The games are fun and even my 4 year old can play all by herself.  I love the speech practice where it records your voice then plays it back in a word by word comparison with the word spoken correctly.

I have no idea how good an application this is yet.  But I do know that if a CD ROM is required every time I run it that I will not use it.

So in case publishers have not heard, most mainstream laptops do not have built in CD ROM Drives anymore.  Requiring a drive to install is understandable.  Requiring a drive to run the app is not OK and has not been for several years now.",117,45

The first 8 CDs were pretty good. Then you heard Spanish people in different conversations. I got nothing out of the last 8 CDs. The speakers spoke so fast I could only understand a few words in each sentence. To their credit they did they did repeat the sentences, but this approach did nothing for me. I listened to the entire course 3 times, and still could not understand the speakers. What made it worse was that they spoke the sentence very slowly in English, but then said it so fast in Spanish that it actually makes you angry that they do it this way.",138,63

I bought this package for the pure fact of listing to the cds while I am driving to work.  I have only listed to the first half or about 10 cds.  I have not utilized the DVD's nor the second half.  However, I wanted to let you know that you either need to write down the vocabulary and verbs so you can learn the words and listen to the cd again.

Overall, it's not bad for a software under $30. If you take full advantage of all the discs, I believe you should be very pleased. My only complaint would be the case. The CDs are all stacked upon one another in a plastic case. They're also very difficult to get out (or at least on my set, don't know if everyone is the same).

It is the very model of awful software engineering.",87,169

I just started and am only at the beginning of Level 1, so I can't say how it does in higher levels. I love being able to go in and do word practice over and over until I get it and the review games are fun. I am anxious to let my 4th, 3rd and 2nd grader play along with me also.

That being said a family trip was planned for Mexico and I didn't want to look like a complete tourist while wandering the streets with a dumb look on my face.  After checking out Rosetta Stone's website I just didn't want to invest a week's salary on learning a new language.  This product provided me enough to get around without bogging me down with too much information.  It took me a few times of doing the same exercises but I had figured it wouldn't be an instantaneous fluency.  I did download the MP3's on my Ipod but found myself skipping over most of the lessons and my mind wandering about a minute into listening.

Also, customer service was terrible.

Cakewalk needs to spend more time trying out their own software, with various computers and operating systems, and looking for problems, rather than focusing on the art of rigid programming rules.  Musicians don't want to waste time with programming.  Musicians want to create.  Cakewalk should either fix these problems or TAKE A WALK.  Do you get it Cakewalk, I was _____ with this software.

I have used earlier versions of Cakewalk and know a thing or two about computers. But this program just is a constant headache.

Plus, all the samples and clips that come with it are trash. They are all House and Electronica type stuff.

All I wanted was something that could let me lay down guitar, vocals, and drums in separate tracks, I have a Xenyx Q802USB Behringer to manage my EQs, and I don't care much about MIDI so that whole part of the program is useless to me....This is the first recording software I've ever tried outside of Audacity, and I was kinda expecting that since I was actually paying for it, that it would come with a decent manual and do a good job handling my recording.

The manual is a bit light and would have benefited from a competent technical writer.

It wasn't difficult to jump in and start modifying and editing clips, most of it is just drag and drop. Cutting is easy, moving samples around is also very easy. There are a huge number of transitions, effects and ask that will either make your movie great our very kitschy. Less is more. All of this happens with almost instant and continuous rendering so you can get a hint at the eventual product.

The usual capabilities exist: adding audio, recording voiceovers and so on. In spite of this, the software isn't that cumbersome on system resources.

I was most interested in the Live Screen Capture feature, but it was a bit difficult to find.  Users are required to look for it in Program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it.  Despite that small flaw, Live Screen Capture works well most of the time.

That's what I thought After the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems I had with Studio 17 and being charged to get support, I just gave up. There are so many other programs out there that are far superior than Pinnacle Systems. I would suggest going to your local Best Buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person (no charge) to compare programs to your needs.

I work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no, I do not need to get bogged down in every file I ever processed each time I want to create something new. The learning curve is steep on this - the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly.
And as others have noted, be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating. I'll keep at this for another month or so and update if something changes but as of now, this is too frustrating for all but the most die hard video editors.",180,9

Sure Premiere Elements let me run automatic adjustments with lighting, color corrections, and scene transitions.  But when I wanted to get fancy, this software became limiting.  With Pinnacle Studio I am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than Abode, more scene transitions, and I'm able to tweak my videos in ways I never could before.  So far I'm really enjoying this software.  After 3 weeks I'm still discovering more that it can do!

Some people noted the difficult installation.  I wouldn't call it difficult.  I would call it time consuming.  But this I expect with any professional level video editing software.

Certainly won't compete with a $500 mountain bike, but it's great for riding around my somewhat hilly neighborhood. Bike has a good appearance, comes shipped in double packaging for protection. NOTE: the factory installed the handlebars at an incorrect angle. Nothing in the instructions said to fix it, but you figure out pretty quickly that you need to rotate the handlebars for the gear shifters to be in the right position.",80,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,2.0,negative,"First off, I was happy when I noticed the dual-boxed shipping that was done to help keep the bike from getting scratched.  Then, after pulling the bike out of the box, I noticed some nice scrapes on the fork of the bike from where the handle bars were hanging when it was shipped.  Also, on further inspection, I found some other paint scrapes on the back of the body as well.  Also, after placing the front wheel on and checking if it spun straight, I noticed that it was way off.  Basically, it wobbles. Fixing this either requires a trip to a bike store, or purchasing a spoke wrench to fix it myself if I understand correctly.  This shouldn't have come like that in my opinion.  This may get shipped back to amazon at this rate.  Also spent an hour trying to get the shifter adjusted so it would work in all 21 gears.  I appreciate that most of it was preassembled but come on.  At least do it right.",170,1

After I finally assembled it (on pure instinct), the front brake was difficult to adjust - but I managed. The back brake is broken and needs to be replaced - I think. The shifting unit was not factory assembled properly. I had to take the shifting unit apart, as well as take the back tire off of the bike, and re-assemble it for it to even function. Now that it is functioning, I am trying to adjust it to shift properly. I guess that was too much to ask, because it is still not working properly. However, the bike looks awesome.

As an example, the front wheel spokes were so out of whack on receipt that the wheel looked warped. Whoever boxed it up at the factory should have noticed it was that way.

I rode it about ten miles a day for the past 4 to 5 months. The brakes are very difficult to keep adjusted and and also the gear shifter. The rear tire keeps coming loose from baering house and the bike is very heavy. I thought by buying a bike for a little bit more money than a k-mart or walmart would of done me good but in all i should of spent the money on a hi end bike for what i needed.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,"This bike is impressive looking, unfortunately, unless you are an expert bicycle mechanic you probably should look elsewhere.  The components of the bike are fairly cheap and getting the bike to work out of the box will consume many, many hours of time getting it operational.  The brakes used on the bike are of very low quality and should be replaced before operating.  In addition, the gears that come with the bike are also of extremely low quality and will need major adjustments in order for basic use.  Other than the brakes and the defailleur's, the other components are of average quality and perform as expected.

Bottom line is the frame and tires of this bike what you would expect for a bike in this price range.  Unfortunately, unless you are very experienced at adjusting and/or replacing brake mechanisms and derailleurs, there are simpler higher quality choices available elsewhere.",149,30
Sports_and_Outdoors,B0007ZF5JO,1.0,negative,"oh I feel very bad of buying this bike. I bought this bike during the amazon thanksgiving deal for 60$. The bike came in a very heavy box and I moved the box into the living room and started assembling. Damn, there is no manual which says which part goes where. The product description says ""requires only minimal assembling"" but even to do that you at least need a manual. I unpacked it and had no idea on how to put things together, got very upset, so I put the things in the box again and moved it to a corner of my living room. It has been sitting there for a while. I saw lots of screws and small broken parts in the package. I have no idea what all these....

totally wasted 60$. So only if you have a complete bike assembling kit, have patience to spend at least 3 hours and of course able to assemble it by youself without having any manual, then go for it.

Amazon shipped the bike quickly and it arrived within three days after the order. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the handlebars, wheel, seat and pedals need to be assembled. No big problems except for front brake adjustment - they're cantilever brakes, so just take them apart, make sure you put the wheel in center, squeeze and tighten. It took me a while to adjust, but if you've assembled bikes before, it'll take less than 30 min.

WTF?... something fell off, pedals loosed, the ride stopped... now sadness, anger, rage.... damn!

What happened is that the Rear Derailleur (SRAM 3.0) simply broke for no reason. I'm a 5'7, 185 lbs non-athletic couch potato and there's no way I could have caused this breaking by just pedaling. Check the images I uploaded of the broken derailleur. (Customers Images)

This is definitively a case of bad quality plastic components used in an expensive product. I've seen cheaper bikes at local retailers (WMT, TGT, KMT) with better Shimano components.

However, I want to add that it is totally a misrepresentation to describe this as a ""power computer."" It doesn't really compute power. What is does is take your speed and run it through a simple equation that derives your ""power"" as a function of your speed.  If you are expecting a device that does anything but give you a rough approximation of your power output by placing your speed into a quadratic equation with some regression coefficients derived from who-knows-where..this isn't it. Very deceptive product description..good thing it's cheap.",104,10

The mounting bracket doesn't hold the computer firm enough so when you press the display button the computer goes flying off the bike.  The battery only lasted 3 months.  The display turns rainbow colors at about 60 degree F. BUT, you get wattage and all other vital info for your workout--so you NEED this thing.  My Kurt kinetic rock-n-roll trainer is bomb proof.  I love it.  However, this computer is the biggest hunk of junk I've ever used in my life.  Everything about it is of the lowest quality--but you need one, so buy it.

The biggest benefit is that they easily clip around your neck when you are not wearing them, making it easy to pop them in your ears just before you grab for the saw or the nail gun. Construction equipment is loud and running it without hearing protection damages your hearing. And let's face it, unless it takes about one second to locate and put on your hearing protection, it's not going to happen. Some of the other reviewers mentioned durability. I had a pair for a year before they broke, and just bought two replacement pairs. They are a few bucks and easy to replace. Also the gel ear inserts are comfortable and easy to clean.

I got these for yard mowing because my outside-the-ear ""earmuff"" hearing protectors became hot and wet with sweat.  I have an older pair of ear plug protectors that have an adjustable stainless steel band and a blunt type of oil filled ear plug, and they are more comfortable.  It would help if a blunt type of ear plug was offered.

These would be good for short time noise exposure.  The most comfortable hearing protection I have found are the cheap foam ear plugs that you compress by rolling between your fingers and then press into your ear canal.",151,35

2nd. this is very loose compare to other thigh shaper; not tense enough to shape legs. like a grandma/ wanabe thigh shaper

The bands are useful, but you may as well buy them elsewhere instead of in this package. Note: the bands are short and are made to wrap around your ankles; they are not all-purpose resistance bands.

The padding is also insufficient and the hinge is fairly loose, so does not provide nearly the difficulty it should to be beneficial.

Overall, a very disappointing product, although it does work.  If you were quite new to exercise and needed little resistance and were at least about 5'8"", it might work alright, but you would soon exercise past it's usefulness and need something sturdier.",121,52

BUT.

This device is constructed with EXTREMELY flimsy material.  The plastic in the middle that covers the spring gaps and pinches when you squeeze.  Most annoying of all, however, is the fact that the interior wire does not go all the way around the loop.  If you look at the picture, the interior support wire only goes about an inch down after it makes its second turn.  The rest is just foam.  This means that pressure isn't distributed evenly and you end up with one end digging into your thighs.

I also wrote several times to the company to ask them about this and they never responded. So all in all, don't do business with Freestyle. How Consumer Reports rated this pedometer a Best Buy is beyond me.

I have not been even remotely disappointed in my tracker. I find it to be spot on accurate, the design and feel of wear is sound, and with the price, it was the absolute best I could have hoped for. I wear it daily, tracking my steps and calories and distance into my fitness program.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000M5SM7Q,2.0,negative,"I bought this pedometer so I could do the 10,000 steps program.  I ordered it around Christmas, so I expected it to be late.  The invoice had the pedometer highlighted as well as the safety leash.  There was no safety leash.  Trying to reach customer service at Heart Rate Monitors was difficult.  I was holding on the phone at the same time I was holding for a rep online.  I must have wasted 30 minutes waiting.  It took them 3 weeks to send the leash!  Customer service would get a 0 in my book.

The pedometer itself is very sensitive.  It is very easy to somehow reset the pedometer.  If you are going on a walk and want to know how far it is, I suppose the pedometer would work fine.  But if you are doing the 10,000 steps program and wearing it all day long during regular activities, it will some how reset itself.  I'm careful when I use the restroom that I don't touch the button.  I don't wear my purse on that side so it doesn't some into contact with the pedometer.  And the thing still resets itself!

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000UU7X6O,2.0,negative,"This item is best described as a knife-shaped object. It came quite dull, and the steel is too soft to take a decent edge. I wouldn't try to cut anything with it; a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. That said, it suited my purposes as a stage prop very well, and was about what I expected given the price.

The main reason I'm deducting stars is because, contrary to the item description, no sheath was included with the knife I received. All I got was a small plastic cap for the point.

In summary, this is a good option if you want something that looks like a knife but won't be used to cut anything. If you want to actually cut things you should get something of better quality.",133,27

However, at leat 5 of the snap straps on the sheaths don't go around the handles (snaps put on too far from the end), which is annoying. Luckily I have enough leather working craft to fix them, but still. On at least three of the knives, the pommel is loose and will turn almost 3/4 turn to tighten, but won't go a full turn, so these knives have loose handles/blades and feel sloppy/wobbly. Disappointing. But, they were cheap, so there you go.",111,42

The cheap wood handle does not align at any point with the guard or pommel. Looks like they used a wire brush and a rock to finish it. The lacquer was stuck to the plastic. The blade is misaligned with the guard. The leather (?) sheath is thin as paper and the stitching was do loose you can see an 1/8 inch gap. Overall, it was a complete waste of money.

I don't know what the other reviewers' experiences were, but my case came in one piece nicely packed in a box with multiple inflatable packaging around it. The frame itself is great and just the right size for displaying a comic book I recently had signed. It's made of very sturdy plastic. I think I would have to work at it to break the front. The back is a piece of black plastic that doesn't seem as strong and is probably the part that the other reviewers were claiming broke. I can see how that could happen with neglect, but it's definitely strong and sturdy enough to hang on the wall.

On the other hand, I am big into the outdoors and if you want this for camping, it is cheap and will not insulate you to any degree of comfort. Don't be cheap with your sleep, get a good pad....this isn't it. It would be ok as an added layer of foam, but that is about it.",103,40

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,"This is probably the cheapest of cheap sleeping pads there are.  As many have stated, this is little more than a piece of foam shipping mat. I purchased it to take for my dog to sleep on during a backpacking trip. I bought it because it was cheap and light weight.  When I received it, I couldn't believe how thin and stiff it was.  Doesn't even compare to a thermarest or any other camp mat for that matter.  I cut it down to fit the dog, and brought it along.  I felt terrible for the dog for making him sleep on it, and it's never coming on a trip like that again.  Spend the extra money.  This seems like something more suited for an arts and crafts project or use as packing material than a sleep support mat.",138,50

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,The picture is a bit misleading. The actual product is a large rectangle of what appears to be a packing foam of some sort.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,"not what I expected - It's only a thin piece of foam - no good for camping.  The ground at my camp site was not rocky, but it was hard.  It hurt my hip bone to lay on my side.",40,54

I wouldn't recommend this for anything, as other companies make a sturdier, thicker, and more cushioned material.  This is more like packing peanuts in a sheet.  The product sent was also not the Coleman brand, but a cheaper brand.",54,56
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,This pad is much thinner and seems more temporary than what I expected. I definitely have buyer's remorse. Not worth $10.,21,57

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,5.0,positive,"It was just as I ordered, and it is going to fit well in the sleeping bag, it is the right size, thank you!",24,61
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,"Pros:  It's cheap in price, yet feels solid and provide adequate cushion.  Rolls up and fits on my pack.

Cons:  It's bulky when rolled up and on the pack.  The color is pretty weak, unless baby blue is your thing, but hey, it was 9 bucks.

Size:  This is sized to match the average sleeping bag.  I'm 5'10 and 175 lbs, and I fit on it nicely.  No overhang, but not too much extra room on the sides  It does, however, have about 3-5 inches of room at the end I'm planning on shaving off to reduce the size.",99,62

If space is an issue during packing for a camping trip, this will definitely be the 1st thing left behind. Doesn't provide enough comfort to justify the amount of space it will take up.

Like other reviews state, this is basically packing material. The advertised photo makes it look like a higher quality pad than it actually is.

I only added it to my cart to get a $20 discount, so it wasn't a loss for me. However, I'd be upset if I actually spent $14.99 on it. Should be sold for $5.

Just spend a few extra bucks and get something that is actually good quality.",120,68
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,"I was hoping these were the same material as the ""classic"" blue sleeping pads, just without the straps.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,2.0,negative,"I'm not a big camper, so I didn't really know what to look for. But, I have a bad back so I wanted some sort of padding. If you just want something between you and the ground, then this is good for you. If you're looking for any kind of comfort, this is not for you. In the end my tent-mate had an air mattress, so I don't know what this feels like to sleep on, but I can say I was not looking forward to trying to sleep on it.",91,70

I usually love to shop at Amazon, but while I was researching if this is the same pad we already have (IT'S NOT-- THIS IS ONLY 3/8 OF AN INCH THICK), I saw it on the Coleman site for $9.99.  Was surprised to find a lower price.  SO-- While I DON'T HAVE THIS PAD-- I gave it 2 stars-- based on  getting it cheaper somewhere else, and believing that our pad-- which is nearly an inch thick-- is GREAT-- and 3/8 of an inch must really leave something to be desired!  I guess if you are a hiker and are space-conscious, it's better than nothing-- but if a few more inches when rolled up doesn't cause you inconvenience, I would look for the thicker pad!",147,72
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,4.0,positive,"If this pad had been a few inches longer it would have gotten 5 stars from me.

It's not super cushy, so you need a flat and smooth place to lay it on, but it does provide some cushioning against the hard ground.  We got this to use as an isolation mat, not for its cushioning, and it does that job exceptionally well.  It's wide enough to easily fit a ""thick"" adult on it, from shin to head (I am 5'10"") and keep the ground from sucking all the heat out of you.  The bottom side of me was the warmest side of me while laying on this mat, and that was in 35* nights, so I would guess that even at cooler temperatures it would do a good job of insulating your body from the cold ground.
For the price, it can't be beat for its insulating properties, but if you are looking for a ""feather bed"" affect, this isn't the mat for you.",165,73
Sports_and_Outdoors,B00168ZJWY,1.0,negative,"This is essentially packing material that is being falsely advertised as a sleeping pad.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,"i bought this tent at an army surplus store for a big game hunt. have yet to use it for that but ive spent numerous nights in it outside. i'll admitt its a little tricky to use right out of the package but once aquainted with set up its bliss to sleep in. keeps rain, bugs, and uneven cold ground out of the equation. you'll need extra rope for the main supports, string for the canopy support, and youll have to store all but the smaller gear underneath the hammok. also a pillow, not for your neck but for under your knees, the curve of the hammok stresses them a little. hope this helps.",114,0
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,"OK. This hammock does require extra rope to even set up.  It may seem ungainly at first, but if you are patient with it you will be rewarded.  I reccomend using a very sturdy rope to set up the wight bearing portion of the hammock.  I just use fishing line (a spool of it would seem useful in a backpacking situation anyways)to hold up the netting and top tarp.  It is sort of scary to get into, but if set up properly, and entered with care, is actually pretty comfortable inside.  I think it's great for backpacking or camping where you need to be off the ground. very light and takes very little space.  Be smart and you'll have no problems.  (BTW, I weigh about 220 lbs. and have no problems with it.",133,1
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,"We bought this hammock in March 2010, and did not even take it out of the box and use it until August. I would give it ""0"" stars if I could. After one use, the seams of the straps that attach to the ropes began to pull apart from the body of the hammock, making for a very dangerous situation if someone were not to inspect and notice it before climbing in. The one person who used it that one time was far under the weight limit the manufacturer rates the hammock, so that was not the issue.

This is an extremely dangerous product. Granted, for the price, you don't expect the quality to match the best on the market. However, that's entirely not the issue. At any price, you have the right to expect safety if used within the guidelines the manufacturer sets for the product. If someone were to climb in and the straps were to snap, a major back or other injury could result. I notified Amazon, and they stated they have had complaints about this item. I guess not everyone takes the time to write a review. I can only hope they remove it from their inventory.",201,2
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,1.0,negative,"I bought this ""hammock"" for local hiking trips and maybe an overnighter. Like the other person stated, it is a pain in the neck to set up. Yes you will need extra line to set it up and it is not wide enough. This thing is better suited to be set up as a ground based mosquito proof shelter. Why would you do that? If that's the case then just buy a net and save on time, money and the added extra weight of this junk. I do not reccomend this cheap alternative to buying something better like a hennessy or other quality name brand hammock.",106,3
Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,2.0,negative,"Pros:
-Not much
-It's cheap and has a mosquito net attached.
-Zippers, seams and stress points are relativley sturdy (though I've only used it twice so far)
-Less bulky than carrying a sleeping pad and tent

Cons:
-There are no directions on how to set this hammock up.  Normally it would seem like a no brainer as most hammocks come out of the box with the suspension ropes intertwined/braided into the actual hammock but this hammock doesn't. You get the hammock (the canvas,net,nylon) and seperatley the rope and metal rings.
-You need an additional 30 feet of rope to suspend the mosquito net and nylon roofing
-No way is this rain worthy as is, you need to get an additional tarp plus ANOTHER 20+ feet of rope
-Heavy, especially with all the additonal rope and tarping.
-Pretty narrow on the inside, especially with the net zipped up and inside a sleeping bag",152,4

Do you know why there are signs before bridges that say, ""bridge freezes before road'?  Well that is because there is cold air going over AND under the bridge, thereby making the bridge colder.  Same thing happens while sleeping in a hammock, it's COLD.  Furthermore, if you move in your sleep (and I mean at all), you will wake up constantly trying to reposition yourself.  One time I woke up, and the entire hammock had shifted to where I was laying on the mosquito net portion of the hammock.

TIP - when you string it up, put all the weight/tension on the bottom ropes.

A lot of people complained about not being able to close the zipper once you get inside...You need to hang the netting using 1/8"" bungee cord NOT ROPE. this allows the tent netting and canopy to FLEX. The only issue I had with this is that we camped at 11000 feet during a really cold and Rainy week. I brought a small tarp with me to cover the hammock that kept me dry but when the wind blew it got COLD specially underneath it. The answer to the problem was to use an EMERGENCY BLANKET to keep the wind from penetrating my sleeping bag. The other issue was finding 4 trees spaced right to hang it.

We set it up (hung)and it did not come out looking nothing like the picture.  The bottom didn't lay flat like the picture shows it was all bunched up and not very wide at all and when attempted to get in it, it was very hard to do since the zipper is on the edge of the bottom and when I finally was able to get in it . It flipped.  So we tried to set it up like a ""tent"" since it shows that you can do that to well it did set up kinda like a tent.  If you peg the bottom down to the ground tight like your suppose to forget getting in it that's for sure!! And then if you get it loose enough to get in you have to crawl on the ground to get in since as I said before the zipper is on the bottom edge.

its easy to carry around
has a decent mosquito net

Cons: does no tome with rainfly shown in some of the pictures.
The side netting tore little
they do not come with ropes to set it up and the entire thing is just uncomfortable.
its extremely narrow on the inside
its not fully water proof

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001ASEJSU,4.0,positive,"As long as your under 6 foot and 250 pounds, this Mosquito Hammock is fine when used with a rainfly over the top.
Yes, it takes a few hangs before you get it right. Remember to tie it up high but straight across.
Use the roof only to block sun. A rainfly is needed as with all the topend hammocks out there. it's a must have.
You have a canvas bottom, which means less chance of a mosquito bite from below. as compared to a nylon Hammock, a bit heavier but still packable.
Not very wide, but for the normal size person you can lay flat or on your side with no problems.
A pad and a sleeping bag makes this a winner. works pretty good on the ground as well with  cot or bottom cloth.
It does everything the big boy hammocks do at a MUCH cheaper price.
ofcourse you can't brag you spent $300.00 on your hammock..but do you really want to? :)

Sports_and_Outdoors,B001F0O3B6,5.0,positive,"Good for square body Chevy trucks with sliding windows, as the window is too short for many metal gun racks without drilling.  The rack works and looks good.  Stronger than you'd  expect, holds two shotguns without bending.  Personally, I like the plastic racks.

If you are worried about getting the finish on your rifle or shotgun scratched, I HIGHLY recommend this rack.  It is plastic, so if the rubber wears off it won't scrape off blueing.  Made in USA which is a nice plus.  The plastic racks were popular in the 80s on Chevy trucks.  Does the job well.

For those who want old school WITHOUT drilling, this is the rack for you.  Don't toss 'em behind the seat when you can keep them nice and clean on a rack.",130,61

Some times when placing a gun on it one may completely come out.  Also the adjustment is only to the distance from the top holder to the roof so you can't adjust the distance from the bottom nor can you adjust between the j holders.  Foget about using the bottom holders if your seats have any type of head rest too. They maybe ok if your using it for an 80's truck or older or maybe on the back side glass of a suburban.,112,89

The page numbers have always been on the lower left, but in 25 years of using Pantone books, I can't say I've ever noticed, or needed to use the page numbers.

I can see where organizing by color would be more user friendly for new users, but for the majority of us, it's a huge pain.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B00005AKZT,2.0,negative,"I learned that with tools you can buy something on the cheap and it gets the job done the first time, but if you ever need to use it again and again, it will end up being very inconvenient or simply quickly breaking on you and you'll find yourself spending money again. This set falls into that category. I've been using these at work for some minor jobs here and there and even for that they've proven insufficient.

First, the case is very cheaply made and it's almost impossible to remove/return pieces back into the molds. You pretty much have to hammer the dies in/pry the taps with a screwdriver.

Second, there's something not right about the tightening mechanism of the tap handle which makes the taps loosen after a couple of turns and therefore lean to the side during a cut.

Third, and most importantly, the dies are brittle! We have 3 or 4 pieces with missing/snapped teeth.

A good tool not only gets the job done, it is also a pleasure to use. This tap & die set is neither.",182,7

The larger one is not much better. The pieces don't fit into the slots in the box very well. I don't use this set very often, but I dread when I do have to use it.

My first project was to tap mild steel with the 4-40 tap, probably the most difficult test. I couldn't even get the tap started -- it was terrible. I thought my tap hole was mis-sized (but it wasn't). I used the #41 drill which is for 50% thread depth (larger than the 75% thread depth option). I went to the hardware store to buy a 4-40 tap and that one worked without any issues. My guess is the rest of the pieces are equally low quality.

Even with much care and cutting oil, I've broken the taps with little effort. The handles to hold these are a total joke, and a serious pain to use. It does not securely hold the taps or dies securely, and makes it tough to properly align or start them into the piece you are trying to thread.

Tried re-tapping one single hole on a motorcycle fender and followed their directions for pre-drilling size to a T and the tap snapped off in the hole.  This was a monumental problem as the steel is hardened well beyond that of any drill bit, making it essentially impossible to drill it out.  I ended up having to grind out the entire nut that was welded in there and welding a new nut on, which had the lovely side effect of burning the paint on the other side.

Unless you absolutely positively don't care about the item you're tapping, don't use these.  I understand that it's a cheap set, but I'd except it to at least work ONCE without breaking.  The cost savings isn't worth the potential hassle.",129,68

The screw driver magnet broke in the first few uses, crescent wrench is useless.

Spark plug sockets came in handy but then I remembered that the bike came with a spark plug tool which worked better. But one of them was used to remove the front wheel from a 2005 R6 with a pair of vice grips to hold in place.

Finally after 2 years of service the ratchet gave out, which means I need to get a new one. I'll most likely get a new Craftsman set from Sears since their warranty is excellent.

I don't know if this is a complaint or normal with these types of tools (because this is my first) but the tap wrench becomes loose and must be tightened several times during a tapping event.

You must realize this tap&die set is for very soft materials such as wood, aluminum, brass, copper, etc. You must go very very slow and not force the work piece.

There is a vague stamp on the taps with a number but it is too hard to read or know what it means so I matched the taps with dies by simply screwing one into the other.
The packet it came is was different. There was a decent PVC pouch for the Die tool but the Taps came in a separate disposable bag without compartments that was not resealable so I will need to find a suitable pocket / miniature container to hold them safely in.
It is possibly not enough for a professional but I would not know. For amateurs and beginners I think it does a great job and I recommend it.",159,12

If you can get both your hands up there then it might work.  But with one hand it's nearly impossible.

The only positive of this wrench is that it is quite large, so it can work for nuts that are 2"" and larger.  Other wrenches I've tried were much too small for a 2"" nut.",104,1

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,5.0,positive,It is hard to find a basin wrench that is big enough to turn that big nut that holds the single handle faucet to the sink.  This one does it and is inexpensive too.,34,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4.0,positive,"Every once in a while, you're confronted with a 1 1/2"" to 2 1/2"" nut holding a sink faucet.  This is usually tucked up behind the sink well, and the only way to get at it is a with a basin wrench (or some very tricky maneuvers with a set of adjustable pliers!)

This large-jaw basin wrench solves the problem, nicely.  More typical basin wrenches will work up to about 1 1/2"", after that you've got to improvise.

The extended upper jaw on this unit allows you to work with nuts up to 3"" in width, which covers the majority of 1 1/2"" to 2"" sanitary pipe fittings.

You don't need it everyday (unless you're a plumber) but when you do need it, it's nice to have.",127,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,4.0,positive,"Pro: build to last and can fit up to 4"" nut.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,1.0,negative,"The only thing good about this purchase is the stellar customer support from Amazon.

The tool has no spring as every other basin wrench does so you have to try and hold it closed with the free hand, reaching up behind the sink which defeats the purpose of the 16 inch handle. The seller doesn't return emails but Amazon stepped up and refunded the purchase price.",66,6

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000FH86VI,2.0,negative,"I got this to remove a rusted on (single hole) kitchen sink nut that a standard jaw size basin wrench was too small for. It didn't work. I tried Liquid Wrench, I tapped on it etc. I put Vice Grips on the shaft to increase the torque as the ""T"" handle is rather small.  In the end I just cut the nut off with a Dremmel. I should have done that in the beginning.

The 1 3/8"" nut  I used it on seemed to be at the small end of it's grip (don't get this tool INSTEAD OF a regular jaw size basin wrench). The jaw is not ""spring loaded"" to help it grip the nut like my regular basin wrench is. New kitchen sink fixtures don't seem to need a tool like this for installation.",136,9

The lack of spring didn't really make it that much more difficult as I could reach my hand up to the nut but in certain circumstances if you can't get your hand near the nut without the spring you may be in trouble. Is saving another 15 bucks off a higher quality wrench worth it? Hard to say, how often will you need to use it? I'm confident even without the spring you'll figure out a way to make it work. Once it grips it's super easy to tighten the nut. My kitchen faucet no longer moves thus I'm super happy...",121,12

The screening material was easy to find at the local Home Depot, but the tabs where nowhere to be found.  These have worked well with the charcoal colored screens that I used.  I'm not particularly ""handy"" with DIY stuff, but these were easy enough to use.  It just took a bit of work to figure out which side of the screen to place them (opposite the side where the spline is located) and you need to work it a bit as it does make inserting the spline a tighter fit.  I used a 0.140 spline with a standard screen.  The tabs make the insertion and removal of the screen much easier and so far they held very securely.  Time will tell if they will get brittle as they age.  The one negative is that since they are a solid black color, they are noticeable.  My previous tabs were clear, but then, they got brittle over time and just broke when I tried to remove the screen.",183,6

The rack was twisted.  One screw was loose, another had the nut laying in the bottom of the box.  I took the punches out to fix the loose screws and discovered the rack had been twisted so far out of alignment that one of the punch holes had been torn.

The final discovery was when I tried to put the loose nut onto its screw.  It wouldn't stay so I decided to replace it.  I pulled the screw out and discovered it wasn't threaded.  Apparently whoever assembled the rack was more interested in getting it shipped then quality control.

On mine, the metal carrier is not very well aligned (the middle support shelf is not welded exactly parallel, but the top and bottoms are).  The size of each punch is stamped or etched on the top which is nice.  This set is made in China.

Concerned that this may be a cheap imitation, I contacted the Fowler corporation and was told that this is indeed a Fowler product.  I made a few punches into cherry stock and the tip showed no sign of wear.  The punches themselves look well made.

I had to buy a new hose to replace the old one along with a new shower head. after a while the connector between the shower head and the filter broke, since it was plastic.

Then I moved to the midwest where I found the hardest water in the U.S. It clanks as it comes out of the tap. You have to use a chisel to remove the residue from your counters. It leaves my hair dirty-looking, stringy, dull, and flat. Water softeners don't do a thing to help. Even moving to a neighborhood with so-called ""city water"" is no improvement.

I tried every type of shampoo and conditioner, tried rinsing my hair in rainwater I collected in a barrel (that worked a bit though it can be quite a shock in the winter), and concocted a vinegar rinse. Finally, I purchased the Crystal Quest with its super-duper filter. Not only is my hair soft and manageable again, but my skin feels much better, too. It was easy to install and works great.

I could tell a night-and-day difference between this bulb and an ordinary incandescent. It's (very) noticeably dimmer than the energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs I have around my house.

So why do I like them? Well, an ordinary incandescent bulb might use 60 watts of power and this thing uses 3. Even 60-watt replacement compact fluorescent bulbs use about 17 watts of power, so these bulbs even make other ""energy saving"" bulbs look like power hogs by comparison.

The key consideration before buying is where you think relatively dim bulbs might make sense for your needs. For me, I have a porch light and two lights on either side of my garage that run all night. The light is enough to illuminate that outdoor area well enough, and since the lights run all night, using these light bulbs saves quite a bit of juice!

If you are familiar with compact fluorescent bulbs then you may notice the wattage equivalence is not the same. There is a difference in light output between a 7 Watt fluorescent and a 7 Watt LED. On the whole, you will need many LED bulbs to replace incandescent or fluorescent bulbs in the same lighting situation. A typical light in a living room, for instance, may use a 150 Watt incandescent bulb. In order to get somewhere near the same amount of light, that living room need three LED bulbs to replace the incandescent bulb.

The light is dim enough so that from ten feet (three meters or so) I can't really distinguish colors of things. However, the bulb may actually be a bit too bright as a nightlight if your nightlight is close to your bed.

This is the good part: this bulb is cool and easy to use. If you need a nightlight and suspect you may forget to turn it off, then this is the perfect light for you. At only 3W, it won't run up your electric bill. There's no glass in this bulb, at least as far as I can tell. The bulb is plastic, specially designed to disperse the light uniformly.

I have been experimenting with the various bulbs for a few years now and sadden to say that no major company has steeped forward to develop an LED bulb that puts out a normal light which is useful.

These LED bulbs fit well into the fixture inside the fridge, and even though at first they looked pretty dim compared to the overly bright 120 watt total of the factory bulbs, now I really don't notice it. I think putting two 60-watt incandescent bulbs into the fridge is insane, and Kenmore should be ashamed.  What happened to the 25 watt appliance lights?

I wish the price of these LED lights was more affordable, but considering they last so long - I think it's worth it.  As long as you don't expect them to provide bright illumination that you get from old styles bulbs or CFL, I think you will be happy with them.",158,39

I previously had the 15 W bulb on a photoresist switch mount such that the light was only on when it was dark outside.  This LED bulb was NOT happy with that switch (flickers on/off rapidly), so I removed the switch mount and the LED bulb is on 24/7.  [That's still lower total power usage, so no problem.]

The bulb works well, even in sub-zero temps.  It gives enough light to find the key hole on the door, but not so bright as to attract swarms of bugs in the summer -- exactly the right mix for a porch light!

The other two bulbs are bright white.  I wrote a letter to Westinghouse and they promptly shipped out a replacement bulb with no hassle.  GREAT customer service!

We have a pair of porch lamps.  After replacing one 13W CFL with this LED bulb, my wife said, ""...Is it on?..""  Comparing them side by side, the CFL has about 4x the (visible) light output, and about 4x the wattage, so the LED seems to have equal ""eyeball"" efficiency to the CFL.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000UQ0HQG,1.0,negative,"We have recessed lighting along our stairwell, and these lights end up staying on 24/7.  Currently there are 5w CFLs installed, and I thought this would be an ideal application for LED lighting.  The CFL's are about half again too bright for what we need, so I figured the LED's might have a chance.

Not even close.  At most they cast about a 2-3' halo of light, and dim light at that.  Beyond that radius, not much help at all.  As a rough figure of merit, I do not believe they cast as much light as a candle.  They are also a very blue light-but are so dim, it really doesn't matter.

i expected some compromises with LED lighting, but these are just ridiculous. I assume that LED's that cost 10x as much as these might be useful, but at current electric rates, the payback is about 25 years.

I am hard pressed to come with an application where these might make sense.  Given the duty cycle of a refrigerator light, the payback is probably 25 years as well.  They might make a nice nightlight-except for the bulb base being a standard size.  I don't think the color lends itself to mood lighting either.",204,51

A range hood that uses 2 bulbs (1 LED light may or may not be enough). The light is white, not the warm yellow of incandescent bulbs, but I like the white light.

This can also be used in a table lamp that would be used as a bright night light that illuminates most of a dark 10x12 room, or for low level mood lighting. Not bright enough for me to read by, but my preference is for a bright reading light.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"ok, it is cheap, but I don't need to do any super-precision work, and I figured that for something made out of metal, I could get this thing dialed in. (I'm an engineer) well, it is actually pretty solid and would have potential except for one very critical component. The lower axis screw threads through and drives a small, loosely mounted threaded block made out of PLASTIC. This interface has an incredible amount of play which can not be adjusted, and if the plastic wears out (which it will!) the play will get worse, and when it breaks, you no longer can move that axis. Strangely, the upper axis threads through cast metal, and is reasonably solid.",117,15

I should have researched this tool better before I ordered it. I wasted my money.
It is too rough to be used for milling, but it does work as an oversized vice, although it might be more useful as an anchor--but I don't have a boat.
The vice came with a broken-off crank handle--not from shipping, the package was fine. The postage to return it isn't worth the benefit of a refund.

Pretty much drill bit only. Chatter is death to an end mill and the work you are trying to complete. That said, you can easily rough the work and use the end mill for plunge finishing pockets which was just as effective if not as fast as just using the end mill to mill out a pocket. Super drill press vise if you spend time setting it up. 80% receivers can be finished with patience but you aren't buying a bench top mill here. If you combine the price of a drill press plus this slide table, you can get a hobby mill that would be much better suited. If you already have a drill press, this is worthy of purchase.",147,66

In my case, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the vise, the out-of-the-box performance, and the quality of machining.  Though the excellent machining may have been a fluke, I have been impressed with this vise, for the price.

My only real complaints are: The handles are a joke.  They're floppy, flimsy, and appear to be bakelite.  And, the paint job is laughable.  The vise appears to have been dipped in a mixture of recycled enamels, baked, and then finish-machined.  There are even brass and steel chips cured/baked into the multi-colored paint on mine.",127,77

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"Total waste of my money -- the machining on this sand-cast import cross slide vise is very rough and inaccurate. On my copy, the upper dovetails are not parallel, so it's sloppy loose on one end of the travel, and jamming tight on the other. To use it, I have to be continually adjusting the three tension screws along the side of the dovetail. Furthermore, the lower and upper dovetails are not exactly 90 degrees, so I had to make a set of special tapered jaws for it to correct for the run-out.

All slides wiggle side to side.  You can clamp down the screws a bit and this helps a bit, but then it doesn't slide well.  The KILLER, however, is the lower pin that mates with the lower gear drive: it is not round and is so undersized that the entire lower stage has 1/8 of slop.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,"I purchased this to use on a bench top Craftsman drill press, to be used as a ""Milling Machine"" for many projects that I do as a gunsmith.

I do A LOT of research before I buy just about anything. I'm glad I did for this Cross Vise. It comes as others have stated, covered in varnish/cosmoline/grease. It needs to be removed. I took the entire vise apart, used a rotary tool to polish the sliding surfaces, and then cleaned everything in my parts washer. It cleaned up well! I then treated it as a ""gun"" and oiled everything as needed, added grease to certain areas and put it back together, tightening everything...I did not have to replace anything...as once it was put back together...it's almost like a $150-$200 cross vise. I say almost as there is a bit of loss in it's precision...but for what I needed it for, no issue.

Overall, once you do the work (keep in mind, you really are saving a lot of money over other models that come to you almost in the same, unusable condition)...it is WELL WORTH every dollar of money and time!",191,103
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,this vice is a great addition to my bench top drill press. i have had it for a while now and have been using it on almost a daily basis...not just for milling work but it also works well as a bench top vice to...i use this vice more than my standard bench top. this cross slide is a great buy. for the money you cant get a better cross slide vice...i have used it to mill 6061 T6511 aluminum and various types of steel as well as other materials with no hang ups....i did have to polish the surfaces that the vice slides on....{not required}...but i am picky and it was sliding a little gritty feeling at first...but after i got it polished up it works awesome now...,129,104

Im milling delrin (plastic), which is just a bit easier than aluminum. My drill press table won't lock anymore - probably because of all the plastic shavings - but the vise works perfectly.",53,107
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,Pleasantly surprised! The ways on this vise are adjustable so you can make it nice and tight. The handles have some play in them so I used some loc-tite green for cylindrical bonding to stiffen them up. A few minutes to adjust all the points of  the slides and properly lubricate it and it is a decent vise for under 30 bucks for all the little drill press projects I am going to do !,75,108

I like the little vice.  I have a machine shop so I can make things to tweek this product.  For example, if you want the vice in the middle of the table, you'll have to have an extension bar to move your y axis because the handle will hit the table.  It works and if that's all you want, then....enjoy.  If you want precision, go to Kurt.",95,109

I went to local tool supply store to check this item out and it was simply a very cheap piece of Chinese junk...far worse than I expected. Of course, the price raised that flag. So I put it back in the box and didn't buy it. Would rather spend two or three times the asking price  for something a bit more solid and accurate.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,5.0,positive,Those of you complaining about the quality of the product are probably not happy with anything ever. You need to consider that you cant even buy a standard bench vise for 30 dollars let alone a vise with an x and y axis movement. Those of you with realistic expectations will be thoroughly satisfied. Those of you who want professional machinist quality results will need to shell out 100 dollars or more. You get what you pay for.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,I expected this unit to be somewhat sloppy due to the very low price. I was prepared to disassemble and polish all the mating surfaces. The paint blobs pressed into the surfaces and crude machine work should be expected for such a cheap unit. What I didn't expect were key ways that were milled off by 10 degrees. The mating surfaces only contact at their edges which were pitted and irregular. There is no way to get a reasonable amount of slop out of it without it binding in places across its travel. It's not worth returning it due to the cost for shipping a heavy item. I'll use it as a fixed vise. Forget milling with it.,118,116

Bottom line - heavy junk, might work as a boat anchor.",64,118
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001FGAJTA,1.0,negative,"Very poor quality.  The ways were machined poorly (very rough and uneven machining with lots of chatter) and the adjusting screws were cheap.  I was unable to get the excessive play out of the ways, even after much tinkering.  There is also a lot of end play in the lead screws, especially the bottom axis.  The bottom axis on my vise slides back and forth about 1/8"" without turning the lead screw. This makes it almost impossible to position anything in the vise reliably.  After taking the vise apart, I noticed that one of the adjustment shims was drilled completely through so the adjustment screw wasn't pushing on the shim, but directly on the way itself.  I was going to bring the whole thing to my relatives machine shop to re-mill the entire vise, but I think it would be easier to build a whole new vise from scratch instead of fixing this one.

I have given the 1 star rating due to the fact that the pictured clamps, and what I received are totally different.

Update: Well I am glad that they changed the picture to what the clamps really look like. All of the plastic coverings have come off the clamps at the time of this update. I really did not expect a lot from the clamps, and my rating would have been around three stars, but with the picture being wrong and the jaw opening size being incorrectly stated at the time of my original purchase. 0ne star is about the right rating.",163,8

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,"I've had these lights for a couple of years now and enjoy watching them when I'm sitting outside. I especially like seeing them sway in the breeze. They have a soft glow and flicker randomly, much like real candles. In fact, shortly after I moved them to a different corner of the house, my neighbor called, worried that something was burning in the back yard.

These lights are decorative, they're not bright enough to light a walkway. They have withstood plenty of wind and rain.

They do need a lot of sun to charge. I've had the best luck with them on the south side of the house. But you can remove the batteries and charge them if you have a NiCd battery charger. The batteries that came with them stopped charging after less than two years. I put the lights in storage during the winter, I don't know if that contributed to their demise. After replacing the batteries, they're working fine again.",163,44
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,This item came with a missing part that the other lantern could not be as tall as the other one. It was returned and the customer service did not follow up. The item was cheaply made not like the photo.,40,45
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,Contents arrived with pieces broken off inside the light housing.  Original seller/manufacturer did not use packing materials.  Disappointing because it's difficult to find amber solar lights rather than the white lights that almost look blue.,35,46
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,"I purchased these for a Christmas present and returned them immediately. They looked very cheap, and not what I expected at all.",22,47
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,I really liked this BUT the batteries corrode.. Regardless of the type.  They light are great for pretty and not functional because they don't put off much light.  We got about 1 summer out of them before they went to crap.  Not really worth it.,45,48
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,"Love, love, love these solar lights.  They work great and look fantastic.  I will probably be buying more!  Would  highly recommend buying these.",23,49
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,I had to send them back because they were obvioulsy used.  They had scratches on them and only one of them worked.  I was very bummed because I loved the looks of them.  If they could assure me that I would get brand new ones then I would definately order them again.  I can't find these anywhere else so very disappointed.,61,50
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,a very good purchase. no problems. i enjoy watching them at night. would highly  recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying this set.,24,51
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,What you see is not what you get.  Can't tell by the picture what you're actually getting.  It's ALL plastic and very flimsy.  Not worth the money.  Get better ones in home improvement stores for same price.,37,52
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,These lights are not what they claim to be. They were fine for the first week.  Since then I haven't gotten them to burn anymore. Either of them. Don't waste your money.,32,53
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,"I was so excited to put these on either side of one of my garden statues, and they looked terrific the first night, and they haven't come on since.  I like some other reviewers also broke the flimsy shepherds hook just trying to put it into very soft ground; so I used a couple of my Big Lot's hooks; luckily they fit through the top ring of the lantern. I did see the review regarding bad batteries and may try that because they really did look like candles flickering for the first couple of hours; however, I would not buy again--not worth the hassel of returning.",106,54
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,4.0,positive,These are way cool.  Unfortunately the hanger part broke on one of them right away.  It's still useable... just can't hang it up!,23,55
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,"These are attractive when viewed close-up. Unfortunately one of my two stopped working. I tried new batteries and even charged them in my home charger. At first it came on if I tapped it but then it stopped entirely.
I do not recommend them.",44,56
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,"I have 10 of these, and might get more if I want to hook up these lights to a solar array it (panel) can be done. Easily breaks if not handled REAL CAREFULLY, but the shipper replaces them without fail and covers the shipping cost so no pain for me. The cheap plastic top when you fist go to turn on the battery would break easily as you then try to lock it in place. I learned through this breakage that this item battery while cheap the wires can be hooked (re-connected to) a solar panel to get all night lighting. You can find a good panel at any store which you can find woks allnight for thirty bucks which comes with their own lights. I have which I plan to hook up in far future. But for now it lasts about 4-5 hours in full sun and shade. and 5.5 to 6 hours in full direct sun. I added pics.",161,57
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,"THESE LOOK VERY NICE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY ARE VERY POOR QUALITY. I BROKE ONE JUST TRYING TO GET IT OPEN TO TURN IT ON. THE PRICE MAKES IT COST PROHIBITIVE TO SEND IT BACK. I WILL SPEND MORE TO GET BETTER QUALITY THE NEXT TIME.",44,58
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,These look great on my walkway on the way to the patio.  They look just like lit candles.  Very romantic looking and pretty durable so far.  I have a few large dogs and they have bumped into (and knocked them over) quite a few times and they continue to work just fine.  Very pleased with these solar lights!,58,59
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,5.0,positive,"I love this item and feel I received a good bargain.  I have put these two lights in the front by a walking path and they have really improved the look and curb appeal of the yard not just at night when they are flickering, but also during the day.  Even though the lantern part is plastic, it is hard to tell it's plastic and they have withstood a couple of pretty severe hailstorms without any damage at all.  I am very pleased.",83,60
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,2.0,negative,"I love the look of these lights but they are not amber - they are white.  I bought them because I thought they were amber.  Also, the plastic holder the stake goes in broke immediately on several of the lights (very cheap).  The lights worked okay for two nights and then they stopped working completely.  When they did work, the lights did not stay on for very long.  What I found out after only a few days of use is that the top plastic part have several sections that are glued together and the glue stopped holding and the top part of the lights started coming apart which caused the wiring to pull apart.  After trying to fix this, I was so aggravated at how cheaply they were made and how they kept falling apart that I threw three of the four lights I bought out.  A complete waste of money.  I see now that for something like this, it is important to see and inspect them for quality before purchasing.",171,61

I'm looking for some like this but tall like 6""maybe",20,62
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001JO9SY0,1.0,negative,"I have never written a negative review but I have to warn people - these are complete junk.  I buy from Amazon all the time but these were a complete waste of money.

I literally broke these in just ten minutes and have thrown them away.  Cheap quality and the plastic tops of the lamps broke just untwitsting to turn them on.  The metal stakes don't align so I couldn't use those either.

This is my personal opinion but the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon.  Save your money folks.",91,63
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,"Easiest thing I have ever setup.
Press and hold time while pressing hour, etc. Doesn't get any easier.

I got this for turning on/off a lamp.

Place in bottom outlet and you can still use the top one. Great design.

I haven't had it long so I hope it holds up for my 5 stars...",55,0
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,The timer works as advertised.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a multiple setting timer.,16,1
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,"Problem:  Amazon write-up on it when I purchased it indicted that it would handle 15-amp loads, but when I got it, I found that it will handle just a bit over one-half of that.

Advantages:  Electric (motor) timers power draw is actually enormous, overall - since that little motor in them is running 24/7/365 and you can feel the heat generated by them and they lose their timing schedule with a power outage.  This timer is all electronic and has a back-up battery - thus, taking almost no power to operate and keeps it's timing cycle after power outages.  After replacing 3 electric timers with these, a measurable drop in KWH was noted - making it a good ""green"" device.

Other:  Once you get used to the programming and over-ride sequences required, it's easy to use.",136,2
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,"The turn on/off is a lot quieter then the mechanical relay types.
The manual bypass is also a good feature.
Lite on lcd panel would have been helpful.",28,3
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,"I normally like Woods products, but what a disappointment:  This one arrived dead as can be.  The display would not operate.  It would not power up.  So I must join the chorus of unsatisfied customers here whose timers simply did not work.  Woods needs better quality control.",47,4
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,"This item just doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend it. I returned it.

Despite multiple efforts, this timer didn't work. Maybe I received a defective one but based on other reviews it seems unlikely.",33,5
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,"I had two of these, and neither could hold its programming for more than a few hours. I'd come home, find the light still on and the screen in the timer blank.  I wouldn't recommend this, even though it claims to use less energy than a mechanical timer.",48,6
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,"The first timer I bought lost it's programming and time/date within one week of use.  Thinking it was just a defective item, I requested a replacement, which Amazon sent within two days to me.  However the second timer also lost its programming within a couple of days.  I thought that maybe I needed to charge it for awhile before putting it into use, so I charged it for a day.  Same thing happened.  I've had to reprogram it about 5 or 6 times in less than 2 weeks and it consistently is losing the programming. I was hoping it would work because it has 20 on/off settings. But with it not keeping its programmed settings, it's just a worthless piece of plastic.  I'm sending it back to Amazon for a refund and will be buying a timer from a brick/mortar store that has 6 on/off settings.  I need something that I can depend on, and this timer doesn't fit the bill.",161,7

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,I have had this hooked up for over a year and it turns the lights on and off as programmed. Simple to set up. A great product.,27,9
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,"Very nice when I received it, worked fine, very easy to program but it just stopped working after 10 days.",20,10
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,I like that you have so many options for it to activate.  I set mine to turn on the bedroom light monday thru Friday.  I was really glad it didn't have only a choice for every day.  I don't want the light to come on at six am on Saturday!,50,11
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,"My old mechanical light timer drove me nuts with its constant grinding noise as the wheel turned and the big clicks when the lights came on and off.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,The user interface is quite standard and works reliably. It is a bit slow to rotate through 60 minutes. It would be nice if there was a way to decrement the minutes/hours.,32,13
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,"We've tried other timers but they often cost a lot more and have less features. Like most products mass produced in 3rd world countries, there will be a couple out of 100+ that aren't perfect.  Good luck trying to find an alternate product that has a built-in rechargeable battery backup so you don't loose the programming in case of a power failure.  20 program on-off's, daily, weekly, m-w-f, mtwtf, sat-sun.  Easy to program, easy to read and no dip switchs to loose.  For the money, you can't get a better timer.  It works great with our RedyTemp whole house no-wait hot water optimizer.",103,14
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,1.0,negative,"Bought two of these timers.  Both were broken.  One never turned on and the other, the time could not be changed.  Maybe the off chance one is defective, but two?  Product stinks.  Would have given a 0 star if given the opportunity.",42,15

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,4.0,positive,"It could have gotten 5 stars, but the directions were a little confusing.  It works fine, and the time invested in figuring out the directions was worth it.  Not expensive, and works great!",33,17
Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B001Q9EFU0,5.0,positive,"I have three of these that have been in use for several years, and I like them much better than the analog timers that they replace.  They seem to keep their time more accurately and the fact that you can set them to the exact time instead of approximating (as with analog timers) is a plus.  Resetting the time is not as easy as it could be but if you follow the instructions it's not too bad.  My only comment is that mine look NOTHING like the photo that Amazon has posted!  And I know that the part number is correct; I got it off the back of the unit.",110,18

Cons: Within 3 days, the unit malfunctioned and reset itself; losing the time/date and all programming. This unit was controlling my cat feeder, so I'm glad we weren't on vacation when this happened. The next day, the screen went blank; and I had to hit the reset button to bring it back to life.

The directions say to charge before setting the timer, but I had to use the reset button while it was plugged in to get to the setup screen.

The override settings are a bit odd, but once you get used to it, it provides a wealth of configuration options I will probably never need.
The backup battery is a nice feature and seems to work fine (tested with an intentional outage)",97,21

One appeared to be ""dead on arrival"", but I just pushed the recessed RESET button and it sprang to life. What I received is slightly different in appearance to the Internet ad (less asthetically pleasing), but has even more flexibility (20 settings/day). You can easily configure it for all seven days of the week at once if so desired (which would normally be the case). Packaging is clearly marked ""INDOOR USE"", yet I am currently trialing one outdoors. I have always used the old-fashioned mechanical timers...this seems far superior.",109,22
