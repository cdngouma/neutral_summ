All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,This cream has a nice light citrus scent and it doesn't irritate my super-sensitive skin.  I've been using it on my face and neck every day for 2 weeks now.  I haven't seen any lightening yet but I like that it is light and not heavy on the face.  I'll keep using it and give an update after about 6 weeks to see if any lightening happens.,67,2
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,does not seem to work.  no visible difference after using for several weeks.  waste of money.  does not pump well.  have to keep bottle upside down to be able to pump product out,33,3
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,Works great for lightening those liver spots and evens skin tone.  Great product!  I will definitely reorder this product regularly!,20,4
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,I have been using this product for 6 weeks now have seen a big improvement. I use it for sunspots on my hand and have seen a significant change and I'm excited to see more change while continuing using this product. I would recommend this product for lightening sunspots.,49,5
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,"I recently purchased and began using this product. Within a few days, I started to notice a subtle glow to my skin. I enjoyed that this product was not at all heavy feeling when applied. It was very easy to add to my daily routine.",45,6
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,I'm using the product and I see some lightening of the dark spots.  I'm pleased with the cream and have had no irritation or redness.  It goes on smoothly and evenly.,31,7
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,This product works every bit as good as the Beverly hills MD product at half the price.,17,8
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,Does not works!!! Waste of money!!! Do not buy,9,9
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,I applied every day after washing my face clean. I have used the entire product. Results. Zero. Not even a hint of a change in skin color. It doesn't work period.,31,10
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,"Disclaimer: I received this product for review. Opinions expressed are completely my own.

I've been using this skin lightening cream for over a week now and I must say I really like it's hydrating ability. I have a couple dark spots from newer breakouts and uneven skin and although I have not seen much change in them since using the product, I feel that with future use I will see more results. The cream itself is white in color and is a little thick. It has a light, kind of tropical scent. I find it very energizing and gets me more awake in the morning due to the smell. The cream leaves a not too heavy feeling on the face. It is very moisturizing. The moisture lasts throughout the day. I like also that the product is natural with no parabens or sulfates. The bottle is bigger than most creams that I have seen which is nice and I am excited to use the product and see future results. Overall I think this is a good moisturizing cream, that has a great energizing scent and provides long lasting hydration.",189,11
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,2.0,negative,did not tone my skin as I expected,8,12
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,"Didn't do a thing for me and I have only light ""dark"" spots.",13,13
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,"Great product, haven't seen a huge difference, but do see some gradual changes in skin tone. Makes my skin feel smooth and less oily.",24,14
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,"I really like this product. It is not heavy and feels wonderful on my skin, leaving it smooth and fresh looking.",21,15
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,"My efforts at getting a tan with liquid Bronzers,was not successful, I looked closely at my skin and realized that my face looked really patchy. I was so pleased to find a Lightening Cream on Amazon and I restored my complection. Many thanks.",43,16
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,"This works.  I'm 75 years old and I use it twice a day, am and pm.  It has lightened the spots on my face.  Light makeup now covers them.  Of course, I always use sun screen.",36,17
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,"The 1.7fl oz that is claimed on bottle is actually fraudent. The bottle has less than 0.1 fl oz.
The whole quantity of the cream fits in that little middle bottle that is fitted inside the huge long bottle. Which is not 1.7fl oz by far. That's why the diptube is that short. (See images)
The product owners lie about the quantity and for sure they are lying about the quality of their product.
Give the positive reviews a second thought.",81,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,i love these i got them to make my parents crazy and it worked,14,0
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Looks real and stays on my lip great! Almost gave my parents a heart attack when I wore it to go eat supper with them. It does stick a little if you use it on your lip because of the moisture from your mouth, also wouldn't suggest eating with one on your lip, food gets stuck on the sliding thing quite easily",62,1
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they are a little thicker than I expected but they work wonderfully!,12,2
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"They definitely serve their purpose and look realistic! Although they are not made for daily, 24 hour use, they are excellent for pictures and testing to see if you would want a piercing. The colors you receive vary, so don't expect an exact color. I got more pink than I wanted but, I was okay with that. I definitely recommend them.",61,3
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"Pretty,  came 5 days late,but nice two purple three silver.",10,4
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Just don't buy it. It doesn't look real it looks so fake and you don't even get different colors they are all silver and break at the slightest touch.,29,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"I thought I was getting different color hoops,  yet I got all silver and broken hoops. Horrible product, Very disappointed.",20,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"Didn't receive all colors only black and silver. Aside from the that, they are great.",15,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these were great and look so real but super easy to lose if you're not a very organized person,19,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,The hoops are huge and they did not come in multicolor. All hoops were purple. Way to big to wear anywhere but upper ear lobe.,25,9
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,If you wear it for to long it irritates the skin where it is and it might leave you with a scar but would buy again,26,10
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Work exactly like they say they do. Work well as a faux septum/cartilage piercing, though it was a little too big for my nose to wear it as a nose ring.",31,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"This was an amazing buy. It came in fast and nothing was broken or missing. I received three gold, one red, and one purple. I wore it around town and I had to go to Walmart and my friend saw me and asked if it was real. I didn't want to lie so I said no it's a fake and she said 'it looks good on you' I was quite surprised someone actually thought it was real. I love it, I'm going to buy more and hope for more colors.",90,12
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,I love the prodect. It came early and I love them. I got 4 red ones and 1 blue. I wear them all the time. My friends think that there real when I wear them.,35,13
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,They do not come in all the colors and I only got 4 not bad but still next time I'm going some where else,24,14
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,too big i think for it to pass as a real nose ring,13,15
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"I really like them and use them a lot! I got 2 gold, 1 red, 1 purple, and 1 pink. I was hoping for on to be black but it was fine. Would recommend, doesn't leave a mark but can tend to hurt for a while if you leave on for a pretty long time.",55,16
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,I love it! It comes with 4 and came really early,11,17
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,These left awful soars on my daughters noise. Way too tight!!,11,18
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"Arrived a week early which I THOUGHT was kinda nice until I saw the quality of the product itself. It came with only four even though the product clearly says five. And they were all blue, no variety of color there. And they're all broken, either the silver clip part fell out or is jammed open. Honestly the worst purchase I've ever made, I don't even want new ones or anything to do with these guys ever. I would only recommend these to people who want to waste money.",89,19
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"This is a great product! Shipped 2 weeks early and looks real! I got them to feel like I have piercings and to trick my friends because I'm not allowed to have piercings yet. Anyways, this is a great product that looks real! The only problem I have with the product is getting them on. They are so small that it is really hard to get it on your lip in the right place. They are so small you have to practically rip you lip off. But when on they are secure and feel great. Also, if you are like me and are sensitive to certain materials THIS IS FOR YOU I am very sensitive to certain materials and this I was having a reaction to, so be careful. But the product is great and looks real. And the color is fantastic, I got 5 rose gold colored rings. They are beautiful. I can't blame the small size to get on your lip though because it makes the product more secure when on. So overall I am very satisfied and give this product 5 stars.",185,20
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"I absolutely love them, came 7 days early and even though u can not pick the colors I received two red, two pink, and one purple sense I don't fancy pink I just used nail polish and painh the pink ones black and held them till they were dry enough to set down and then when dry I put a clear coat on and they look like they came black. I also altered purple to silver, and then to blue I just used nail polish remover and then changed the color so super simple, and I totally recommend them don't threat if u don't get the right color ",108,21
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"I just got these in today. I've had multiple piercings in the past and my skin always rejected them, so this is a great alternative for me. It came with 1 black, 1 green, 1 pink, and 2 red rings. They are comfortable and easy to use, and look like the real things, great to use as a nose ring, lip ring, or septum ring.",65,22
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,They're a little uncomfortable but they work fine for fake piercings also that you don't chose your own colors which sucks and they took a while to get here but they're good,32,23
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"They came in way before he estimated time slot and every time someone noticed it, they thought it was real. Perfect for pranks, or to see if you want to get the real thing in the future. I am very satisfied even though I only got silver, which, is the color I wanted.",53,24
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,They came in earlier than expected and they feel fine love them,12,25
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"I love these, but I ended up getting all pink. Its a good product, I just wanted silver.",18,26
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,There awesome! They look real and everything but idk if its just me but when i wear they pinch my inner lip like crazy especially when I try to take them off they hurt the inside but other than that there amazing,42,27
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,My clips came a lot sooner than expected and they're comfortable for daily use.,14,28
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,One was broke sadly and i wish i coudl of got better colors vut besides that their great!,18,29
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I got all silver which i like and they seem pretty sturdy but I'll update when i wear them more,20,30
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Very disappointed. Got 3 pinks 2 silver and a blue? Why wouldn't you give more varied colors.,17,31
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Took less than a month to get here. I got three black, one red and one green. Perfect! I am 100% pleased with my order. They do hurt slightly but it goes away after time, or either with some distraction. I am wearing mine for a septum piercing and I find it will feel better if I take it out and turn it around (so the flat silver part is on the other side of my nose). I have had them for about 3 days and so far no hole in my nose.",93,32
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"i originaly thought they would come in assorted colors, but they all came in this really nice light purple color so im not that upset. as for wearing the actual product itself, it feels a little painful when you wear it for long periods of time. i wore it as a lip piercing and it felt a little weird after an hour or two (i.e; i could talk just fine, but i couldn't drink with a straw because it would shift around uncomfortably), but the feeling's easy to ignore if you distract yourself from it.",95,33
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I wish all the colors that were shown in the picture were what you received. . .,17,34
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,most of them were broken when they came in the mail,11,35
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,You don't get 5 different colors and they break very easy not worth your money!!!!,15,36
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,Highly recommend for anyone not wanting to have to pierce! Looks real and easy to use,16,37
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"One of the worst things I've bought on amazon. Tiny rings, AND NO VARIETY. I read the reviews and they said mostly got silver i'm like oh ok, i'm cool with silver. Nope. I only got all pink..I hate pink. These are completely useless to me, don't waste your money, find another seller.",53,38
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,these hurted just a lil but I forgot about it aftrer a while,13,39
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,Just got them I can't wait to trick my dad hahaha,11,40
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they look really cool but they left a scab on the out side of my lip,16,41
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I am so disappointed in these. Not only were they only pink and white when I was led to believe there were multiple colors (Especially what I really wanted which was black) but 3 of them were completely broken and wouldn't spring shut. One of them the inner part was completely out of. Ill be going to a different sender next time...They were cheaply made and way bigger than expected.,70,42
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,Its pretty good. Just hurts after a while.,8,43
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,These are awesome! They look very real and I've been convincing everyone I meet. The only problem is that the rings really pinch your skin but you don't feel it after a while. I also didn't get much color variety. I only received 3gold and 2 black rings. Which is completely fine with me I can't complain because those colors make the rings look even more real but otherwise they're great! I also received it about 3 weeks earlier than expected!,81,44
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I bought some of these and they don't hurt and they did not put a hole on you. No matter where you put them. I wore them all day long on my lip because that's where the original piercing is. And ther was no hole left by these fake ones. The reason I wore this was because I was taking a break from my real piercing's. I was quite comfortable with these and I will buy them again.,78,45
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I only got blue and purple but other than that they are great,13,46
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Slow shipping and it hurts too much when I wear it. And its easy to lose,16,47
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"They're perfect for what I wanted them for, and they look very good. The only problem was that they didn't come in multiple colors, just five blue ones. If the lack of different colors doesn't bother you, then I would definitely recommend these.",43,48
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I ordered these and it took a month and a half and it gave me all 5 blue like not worth it. ,22,49
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Omg, these are great, I really loved them. I've been wanting to get my nose pierced for a long time but been to scared. Lol look real!!!",27,50
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,Though they make a good fake septum piercing...it came with 4 pinks and a red. Was really hoping I would get one in each color...AS ADVERTISED in the picture :(.,30,51
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"It took a while, but i got them. They are easy to use, but i guess it's too big for my lip. I use them as nose piercing. I lost 2, 1 doesn't quite work and the other 2 are the one's that work well. As soon as i got them, i wiped them with rubbing alcohol just in cade",60,52
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,They hurt a tiny bit but I love how they look.,11,53
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,Just got them today and I love them.  They gave me a variety of colors and are good quality:) I highly recommend these and the price is great!,28,54
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,They are fake they are horrible they keep falling off,10,55
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they're great! i got them to trick my friends and family. and it worked perfectly! of course i'm gonna use them for everyday use. they do pinch you for a few minutes but it stops after a bit and feels perfectly fine. i gave it 4 stars because i got four silver and one blue.. even though it was supposed to come with a variety of colors. but it's okay! I wanted silver anyway. :),75,56
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"Received 5 of them , one of it was Rusty another one deformed and looking rusty not made for the nose even to small as a use for ears or any else also they all having a dirty silver look no colored ones been packed its just looks old like they been not storaged well or been just laying around ,very disappointed and feel tricked. Don't waste your money and time. Would like to receive my money back.",78,57
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,These earnings are really cute!:) They are a little difficult to maneuver at first but you get the hang of them very quickly. The quality is wonderful for the price. I highly recommend this item.,35,58
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I was kind of dissapointed that they gave me all silver but it freaked my mom out which i wanted!,20,59
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Don't buy!!!!  Came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored.,11,60
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"I recieved 6 but they came in pairs of three colors- Pink, red, and silver. It wasn't a problem however, I wanted silver ones and the price of this was great so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra. They came in a small package, the delivery was fast, and overall I consider this to be a good purchase.",62,61
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,Just got mine in the mail 4 gold 1 silver not the colors I wanted but can easily change the color by using nail polish or markers and they fit perfectly for my nose a bit tight on the lip tho  but works great,44,62
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,All the earrings that I got were pink.... I wanted multicolored,11,63
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"I got all of same golden color, waste of money for me",12,64
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Nice! I really like it, but unfortunately, it is a bit messy when applying. But other than that, it is great!",21,0
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I did not like it my teeth became pink,9,1
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Took about 25 day to get here. I love the Cherry Red color!,13,2
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"It really lasts so I love it. It can withstand food, drinks, washing, rubbing, etc. It lasts on my lips for more than 24 hours so it's worth a shot!",30,3
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Nothing looks like what I saw in YouTube/Facebook,8,4
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Doesn't peel off well. Gets stain all over fingers. Light color stays on for few hours at most. Not worth the money. Sadly a disappointment. It did make for a funny facebook live post, because it doesn't work like it should.",41,5
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"I did not like the tint color, it was too light, the lipstick stain didn't lady as promised.",18,6
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,these are great before going out to a big event! its very pigmented and it will literally stay on ALL day! I usually apply mine with just a little lip brush and let it dry completely before peeling it off! the color lasts all day without having to worry about reapplying anything else.,53,7
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Its not long lasting at all, once you drink or eat , it just disappear",15,8
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,It wasn't a rich red like the advertisements show. Also would horribly stain my teeth.,15,9
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,The top almost popped off at first use. The applicator part had a rough piece of plastic so couldn't smooth it onto my lips. Super funny texture and unfortunately left a weird color. I really wanted to like it but it was horrible on all accounts,46,10
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I bought two different colors of these. I am that girl that HATES wearing stuff on my lips and reapplying throughout the day. These are great! I use a small lip brush to apply that I bought cheap from CVS. Make sure your lips are mosturized before using. Apply it slowly covering lips and don't close your mouth and let lips touch until dry. It will look funny but don't worry! I let it dry for about 5-10 minutes then peel off! It looks great! I sometimes put Chapstick over top of it if I want that shiny gloss look. After about 6 hours it starts to wear off for me but it will be different for everyone. I love these for nights out or events where I don't want to keep reapplying lipstick. Plus my husband loves it bc he can kiss me without transfer and I can eat and drink with no problem. Last pic I posted was after 4 hours of it on and eating lunch (cherry red was applied that day)

I recommend to all the lazy girls that still wanna look great ",187,11
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"This does what it is supposed to do. Note that if your skin is dry, peeling off this lip treatment may hurt a bit, so I just rubbed with tissue paper.",31,12
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Love the color of this product! I just don't like how its hard to get on evenly.,17,13
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"The stain did not work for me, but it worked for my mother. I'm confused on the product.",18,14
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"It worked,  kind of.. It didn't Peel well.. Was to thin to grab easy and color wiped mostly off after and the rest only lasted an hr or 2. Color was pretty and it was  cheap.",36,15
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it does what a stain does in the begging a little goes along way .  once you get to the end then its a little stickier but overall pretty good,30,16
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"It's very pigmented,.. Really hard to put on, its sticky and takes a long time to put on. But overall its really good i like it..",26,17
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Very hard to apply.  Very hard to wait 20 minutes for the tint to dry.  The tint also did not actually peel off, but I had to rub it and finally rub a damp towel over my lips to get off all the pieces.  The color was lighter than I expected and it was not long lasting.",57,18
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"It is impossible to get a clean line. The container was approximately 25% full so you had to tip the head back and tube upright in order to get the goo out, thus no mirror view because you are looking at the ceiling.

Took over a month to arrive and it totally sucked- it deserves no stars.",57,19
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,It doesnt go on easily too clumpy and stiky,9,20
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Takes to long to work, then just looks like I ate something red.",13,21
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Shipping took like a month and it does not work good, it doesnt stay that long, it taste nasty, you're better  off buying a lipstain",25,22
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Cool idea but deff not as easy to put on as we see in videos...ends up on teeth n stains your fingers....but does leave a nice stain on lips when everything else is cleand up,35,23
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"I love the idea of waterproof lipstick that doesn't get on anything, but this one does. It was soo liquidy, pretty sure that's not how it is supposed to be and the top part was torn off, but I fixed that. After a long time of keeping it on my lips, I pealed it and the lipstick didn't take affect at all. I was really disappointed. This is not how it's advertised.",72,24
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,My daughter uses this occasionally and likes it,8,25
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip. and gets on teeth when I smile,23,26
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Cute color and staun, but is really messy.",8,27
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,eh.  there are much better brands.  this is loaded with chemicals and i can't help but feel like i am doing my body a disservice.  it takes a lot of time and patience to get on evenly and just isn't worth it.,42,28
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit...this brand peels off nicely,18,29
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I bought two of these the red one is completly unusable. It's so clumpy does not go on smooth.  The taste of this product is gross. I would not buy again.,31,30
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Owmygee! My liptint arrived this morning and it's so nice. It look so good on my lips  So happy for this product. Surely gonna get another one. ,27,31
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I loved this product it works quickly and almost instantly at first I didn't know if this was the peel off one but it was and it stayed in for te whole day I strongly recommend this,37,32
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,It was in perfect condition when I recieved it and it arrived like a week sooner than expected. The color is just what I wanted and really lasts all day. I love it.,33,33
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I like the product, but I do recommend using a lip brush rather than just the squeeze tube for a more precise and even application.",25,34
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,It is super messy to put on and really really sticky. I had to apply it like every hour because the color came off very quickly and the my upper lip didn't not get the same color my bottom lip did. Very sad it doesn't work on my skin =(,50,35
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"These are not meant  for tan to dark skin ladies. I think my lips are somewhat dark, so you can barely see the color on my lips. I picked out the darkest shade too but it's still too light for a tan girl like me.",45,36
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Love the color and its final look. A little bit sticky when putting on, but easy to peel of (don't hurt at all). Highly recommended. Took 1 month to arrive.",30,37
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Don't waste your money. This stuff is horrible- it got all over the place and stains everything (fingers, teeth, cabinets). Consitancy of product is awful- has huge globs that come out. Seriously- don't waste your money.",36,38
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I love this product . It was super new. The shipping was way faster than I had thought it would be . The product got here in perfect shape. Overall the lip colored stayed on all day . I would recommend you to buy this!!!!,45,39
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Applying lipsticks wouldn't be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo.,11,40
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"This is a terrific little addition to the make-up case. It's a little challenging to use the first time but after some trial and error it works great.

First you should use a cotton swab to apply it, this gives you a lot more control which is important as this is intended to stain and does.

It takes a while to dry and you must keep your mouth open or you'll have a mess on your hands. Cotton balls under your tongue help help with the extra saliva, not attractive but effective.

You can also use a hair dryer to speed up the process, however the longer it stays on the better the results.

Interpreting it off use a nail brush to scrub your hands if you keep coconut oil on hand it works great for removal.

On average the color lasts around 8-10 hours with eating, drinking, and smoking.

I've recommended this to several friends and my sister and will definitely be purchasing more.",165,41

Will never try this product again",31,43
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I love it!!! I ordered the cherry red. It is so pretty and peeling it off was oddly fun and satisfying. It came super early and in great condition. It is a little smaller than I thought but it's worth it. The application was fairly easy and it looks kinda messy but the end result is gorgeous!!!,57,44
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Seems like it would work really well, but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency",19,45

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Too thick to put on properly. Was hard to get out of the bottle. The top is poorly made so if you have to push hard enough to get the product out, (which comes out in a giant messy blob) it popped off and stained my nails and hands. Worst mess I ever paid for. And if you get your lips wet the stain never stops rubbing off. It stains your lips but it is a dry mess. Also don't use with your favorite lip gloss. It will put the color all over your wand.",95,47
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"This product is alright. It does drain the lips.. However, it goes on clumpy and sticky, and it looks like you became a vampire and have blood on your lips.

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I'm pretty satisfied with this product. :) It is a bit tricky to apply b/c it's gooey, so you have to apply in a quick swift motion. I watched a tutorial on an application suggestion & that helped. I left it on for 10 min. & it dried with awesome results. It delivered a nice deep cherry red. It even stayed on even after eating dinner. I would buy this again!",71,49

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"It looks like I drank some cherry kool-aid and it stained my lips red. It's nearly impossibly to get it all the same shade.. it's super splotchy. Plus you cannot stay in the lines of your lips well at all, and it takes like 30 minutes to fully dry. Definitely not an on the go lip color, you need a mirror and about 30 minutes to apply and let dry. Not impressed at all.",74,51
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Overall the color lasts a long time on your lips but it takes a long time for the product to dry on your lips and after you peel it off (which is a mess) it just looks like I've had a glass of red kool-aid.,45,52
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"highly recommended , its not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil, aloe, natural fruit essence and also with vitamin E.
I have very sensitive lips so I choose the lipstick that i am using..
jeny!",39,53
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,It's thick and messy;impossible to apply properly the way you would any other lipstick or lipstain; there are much better choices.  I would not buy it again,27,54
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I love this product! I got it in Cherry Red and the finish was like a beautiful bright red lipstick, and it's a pretty good sized tube. I've only had it on for about an hour but it has not come off at all, and it feels like you have nothing on. My only issue was that some of it was leaking out of the sides, of the top, but it didn't drip on anything or make a mess when applying so it wasn't a big deal. I've been trying out different lip stains to recommend one to my best friend for her upcoming wedding, and this is definitely at the top of the list!",115,55
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"very bad product
Tathurt my lips and blood came when  I remove.",12,56
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,I got the cherry red. I really like its color. The longer you have it on the darker it gets. I really like it a lot.,26,57
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"I think mine came defective. The gloss came out of the tube extremely thick, almost like old glue. It was virtually impossible to apply. The color is pretty in the end, but the mess is not worth it.",38,58
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,So although it is messy to apply it really works and does not leave lips dry just put some chapstick after application and your lips will look beautiful :),29,59
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Zero stars. I wasn't happy with it at all. I first seen it on Facebook and it looked like something i would like, but no. I was safly wrong. Came late, hard to put on, dries way to fast, and it doesn't taste very good.",45,60
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,It provides long lasting color and safety on my lips every time I use it.,15,61

I would recommended if would be easier to apply and if it wouldnt dry fast",35,62

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"A great value and a terrific color payoff. To be honest the only issue I had was waiting for the product, because it did arrive a month late. Which doesn't surprise me since it only cost 3$",37,66
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I received it today and tried it on and live it perfect color it looks great,16,67
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Pros: works really, really well. I applied it last night around 8 pm to try it out, peeled it off and was left with a beautiful stain. Didn't bother washing it off before bed and woke up this morning with beautiful lips! And no transfer on my pillow either

Cons: it tastes REALLY bad. Like...there is something extremely bitter in the gloss before you peel it off and if you don't get all the pieces off right away it lingers on your lips and has a horrible bitter taste. But I mean, it isn't meant to be ingested or licked like a lip gloss is so maybe that was my fault.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Shipping was decent. I ordered it the 26th of December and got it on the 4th of January.",135,68
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Excellent!!! receive the product in a perfect condition,8,69

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Super disappointed with this; goes on the inside of my mouth when that's obviously not where I'm placing it. Super icky and the stains I try to clean off from inside of my mouth causes the entire stain to be removed,41,71
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,went on thick and gloppy ugh. not easy to apply at all. very disappointed. I do not recommend it,19,72

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Do not use this unless you have a very steady hand and are possibly a professional makeup artist. My sister gave me some and I thought it was lip gloss. Got some out of the lines as it were and yes, it definitely lasts. My hands and lips and in general the lower half of my face have been bright red for hours now. If you can get it where you want it Im sure it would be a lasting and lovely lip color. But you really need to get it on perfect the first time, or you end up looking like a toddler who ate a crayon.",108,78
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"It's a really cool concept. The application however is a mess. I would recommend using a QTip or lip gloss applicator versus just using it directly from the tube. The stain doesn't turn out that red once it is peeled off, it honestly looks like you just ate a Popsicle. So if you're into that look, this product is for you. Overall it requires too much time to put on. I have used it twice in the year that I have had it.",83,79
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,Does not seem to be something i would wear long time and the material doesnt seem to stay on or look a certain way,24,80

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Nice for the price!! Some of the colors are pretty much the same, so I'm giving a few away as a gift to a friend. Feels good on lips not too glossy and not too heavy. Some do have ""a shimmer"" which I don't prefer, but can deal with. They did come early in mail, but still took 3 1/2 wks to arrive. Overall, I'm happy with purchase.",68,1

The orange and red are almost the same and ll the pinks are similar. I don't know which is which. Oh, and I received two 08's. They didn't come too clean. Like the caps had a bit of lipstick residue on them. They are really small. They're not drying though, they are creamy. I just hope none of them break when applying.

The lipsticks are creamy and soft on my lips and that makes me happy. They were all pretty colors, but I guess because I'm dark they don't transfer so well but whatever! I'm happy to have them either way. They aren't super pigmented when applied, but that might be because of my skin. The colors I wore were 10 (first pic) and 13 (second pic)

Edit: I've concluded last night that some are more pigmented than others (aka the light pinks)",104,27

I was repairing cat claw punctures in a dark reddish-brown leather chair, and I think this repair won't be noticeable, as the damage is lower on a chair leg.

It is pretty darn close to perfect in fixing leather, though it would be nice to be able to dull it up a bit as it leaves a fairly shiny finish.  I've also used it for fixing plastic, rubber, etc.  It dries like a latex finish and can be peeled off carefully if you mess up.  Using a paintbrush to apply it in small spots works well too.  The only complaint I have is that I believe the kit should have twice as much black as the other colors because it gets used up too fast.  Otherwise, it is a great product",106,26

In my own case, it was a torn leather jacket.  I followed the instructions and wound up with a fix that was functional but looked cheesy and rough.  Part of the problem is, it's nearly impossible to get the color matched seal to look good if the repair is large.

It looks much better than the holes did, but if you inspect it, you can see the repaired places.  However, no one looks at my stuff that closely.  Had to send another kit back I ordered by another maker. Their repair stuff was dried up.  Appears all of this kit was good.

It comes with an empty container to mix your colors in, and a mixing guide. They're so easy to mix to get a good color match. The instructions are easy to follow, and work perfectly if you do.

I covered the cut, let it dry overnight, covered it once more, and cleaned the area after it dried.

The jacket was a $2,000 John Varvatos and I trust this stuff on it. It will do just fine!",91,107

It was originally about a 1 1/2 inch tear in a bicast leather couch and it was growing daily. If you have a rip in a bicast couch you need to stop it asap because it *will* keep ripping. Also, I put on about 4-5 layers of the goo over a 3 day period and it's held amazingly strong. It might even be stronger than it was before.

I received the kit, followed the simple instructions, and 30 minutes later voila! no more tear!

Gives about a 2"" x 2"" patch of leather along with a patch the same size of a cloth you put underneath.  You use up the cloth with pretty much one small hole (needing at least 1/2"" overlap in each direction.  You cut the leather to fit the hole & thus can possibly use it on numerous holes with another generic piece of cloth (I haven't tried tho). The hardest part is mixing the paint to match.  They have instructions for basic colors (ex: tan), but to get it to be the color you want is not for the faint of heart.  They might say, mix orange, yellow, white and brown.

Don't waste your money on this product if you have a leather couch with a couple of fine tears in it. That's what I have and this was a waste of money.

The patching pieces (sub-material and the leather) were just too big to fit into the holes I have.

Using a normal, soft dishcloth, wet and well wrong out, no cleaning product on it at all, just plain water, I lightly wiped off my barstools, and there went my new shiny polkadots. All the leather repair rubbed right off like thin plastic. The best thing I can say is that the claw marks are still there and I am right back where I started.

*Plenty of colors of compound are provided, ensuring that the correct color can be mixed. Also I will be able to use this kit again if necessary (though I'll need to provide my own patch next time.)
*The materials are easy to work with if directions are followed.

Now, this doesn't look perfect on my leather chair. We had a large rip (about 4 inches.) I can see where the rip is. But our chair is a burgundy textured leather. Neither the color nor the texture is uniform, so there would be no way to use a kit like this and have the repair compound blend perfectly with the leather.

I could not call this a serious sewing kit. The size and brittle nature of the its plastic construction would make it a poor choice as a travel kit, and I would be very leery of giving this to any child due to the number of small easily swallowed accessories it contains.

If you need to buy a gag gift for someone then this will work for you. The rest of us might want to continue shopping around.

It finally broke down due to old  age and much use, so when I saw this one, I was excited to be able to replace it.  This is not the same; it just looks the same.  It is a scaled down child size version of the real thing.  The outside slot in this one will barely hold a slim note pad.  In the original, the outside slot was big enough to hold 1 or 2 full sized sewing patterns.  The spools of thread in this one are teensy toy spools, just enough thread on each one to sew on a couple of buttons.  The original held full  sized spools of sewing thread.  If you want a stocking stuffer for a child, fine, but anyone who has any sewing acumen will scoff at this ridiculous gimcrack being called a sewing kit.",155,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B001MX6GA2,5.0,positive,"This is a CHEAP sewing kit. but that is EXACTLY what I wanted. I love how there are so many different colored spools. The scissors aren't that sharp. but either use them or use your own pair. I love how it folds up for easy storing (however when you go to close it and lock it by sliding the little tabs, be gentle I accidentally slid mine right off and had to fight with it to pop the tab back on.) I adore all the cute little compartments for organizing. Perfect for every once in a while sewing. I would not recommend getting this if you are a high end sewing person or like to sew a lot.

That being said, this is great tape! Bonds to itself well and seems to be extremely tough. It has a rough, cloth-like surface as opposed to a more traditional duck tape ""plasticy-ness,"" and it's rather thick.

It glows a bright, strong green, and does so for a long time! It won't shine super bright for very long (if you hold it up to a light), but it does have a low glow that lasts for an hour or more, which is totally perceptible in the dark.

Would highly recommend! They also sell a regular sized version, if that's what you need!",123,58

I got the three corners on - bottom two corners and the rear corner on the top - and then lubricated the metal frame (at the front/top) with Wesson Oil. I then used two adjustable wrenches to pry and lift the final corner over the metal frame. I used small adjustable wrenches and used the bottom of the wrench where its flat and round and smooth so there was no concern about poking a hole in the fabric. I put one wrench bottom over the top of the frame and the other over the side of the frame. Inserted them into the fabric and slowly lifted and pulled the corner fabric over the frame. It went on the first try. Not sure if it's because I had heated and stretched it already or not but it worked. I'm going to wait until next weekend to do the other side.,203,16

Pros:
- The fit is pretty good, and installation wasn't TOO hard.
- zippers do not jingle like the Smittybilt, due to the zipper pulls being cord and not metal

Cons:
- The windows are wavy at the top, which distorts your view out the sides.  I don't see any reason that they have to be wavy.
- One zipper has broken on each window in only 3 months.  Luckily there are two zippers so I can still close and open the window.

When you first unpack these skins and hold them up to the frames, you'll say ""no way"".  I almost gave up and sent them back a couple of times.  Finally I heated them with a hair dryer as I was stretching them over the frames, and they finally slipped into place.  Note - get a partner to hold the hair dryer while your stretch - it's much easier.
The gentleman at Rampage explained why they are so tight.  It seems Jeep made two sizes of door frames those years (97-99 I think) so the skins were made so they could fit the larger frame yet not be too large for the smaller frame.  Not sure if that's the case, but it sounds logical to me.

I expect that as I get more practice this will be a non-problem. The book is very wordy, but That's because the chapters are each very complete -- I think it's not to hard to skip forwardc and then go back for the finer details.  However, the library copy came with a CD, with nice music. The edition Amazon sent has a DVD which seems pretty useless. Each topic seems to be about 6 second long and they slide into each other. It's not easy to watch two people dancing for six seconds and pick up  the footwork -- especially when the segments are not labelled on the screen as they come up, and  have of them are a bit blurry, which may be to indicate speed or to give the scene a dreamy look.

It is true that the use of flashbacks and dream sequences makes it more complex than a conventional linear-time story, but I found that the shifts in perspective were very artfully used, providing a contrasting perspective that forced me to reinterpret events at key junctures.

She gets a scholarship from Cornell, goes on to Harvard, earning a doctoral degree.

 Oates is a wonderful writer, and even though I wasn't sure at times if I wanted to finish the book, I am glad that I did.

But the reader might like to know once in a while!  There are many examples of themes and plot lines left hanging in the breeze, such as a gruesome murder that occurs in the middle of the book that is never mentioned again.

The sound quality is VERY similar to what you get from the 71SLs (which is lower bass than the 51s, but much more clarity), but the earhook design of these 81LPs overcomes a MAJOR design flaw of its forebearers. I've had a huge problem with the earbud coverings flying off into oblivion when the plug was pulled out on the othermodels, rending the unit unuseable until I found the extra buds (infuriating when they're in another state).

The earhooks on this one ensure that won't be a problem and are thus infinitely better for use at the gym and elsewhere. Of course the sound quality and clarity on all of these is excellent and although you won't get any directional audio, the plug design locks out surrounding sound like a champ, fuctioning just as well or better than any noise-cancelling headphones in this price range.",185,2

What a deal!
Do yourself a favor before buying: consider my experience with SONY repair. I mailed in my bum buds - the second pair that failed - but I objected to SONY's pricing. Surely they have a better deal to offer? Nope. SONY shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap.

Also, the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while I use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses.  It's doable, but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears.

Finally, the white color goes well with the white iPod models, but after a few months, they tend to show the grime all too well.

In the past I had used these earbuds while lifting weights. Under such circumstances, the experience is awful. Not only do they come out of your ears when you perform any slight movement, but since the wire is meant to hang around your head (and thus, behind your back), good luck trying to lie down or sit back against anything. AWFUL!

For the first time tonight, I decided to run with my mp3 player. Every few minutes, I had to fidget with the ear piece so the buds would stay in my ears. No one should have to endure this BS from a product that is meant to enhance their listening experience. Enough is enough. I'm getting new earbuds. DO NOT BUY THESE!",181,48

I have never written an online review in my life, but for the sake of your health, do not use these headphones. The plugs work by literally being placed fairly deep into your ear canal. With enough perspiration, this rubber cover can come off. Unfortunately, when I removed the earphones, the rubber cover did not come with it, and the gray cover stayed in my ear. It not only impaired my hearing, but caused a good deal of pain (and headaches) for a few days, until I just got my physician to pry it out!! Even as I write this, i'm laughing a bit since it's somewhat humorous that something so absurd can happen...but I'm only able to laugh because it's out of my f*&^ing ear! You've been warned...they are snug, but could be hazardous to your health! Thank god it came out...I'm going to stay away from plugs in general, especially when I used for running.

Now they sound fantastic!

With the three sizes of earbuds included you should be able to find a size that fits your ears.  Make sure you try all three sizes and place the earbuds as far into your ears as possible before you decide if you like the sound on these headphones.",117,55

These earphones come only with a 90 day warranty from Sony.  Sony will replace them with a refurbished pair for about the price of a new pair - $29.00.  Previous reviewers have noted the same problem and suggested that Sony respond to this.  They have.  They have discontinued the product.",108,69
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"I loved this headphones. They were the excellent iPod headphones replacements. They have got fabulous reviews. But just do a google search typing ear buds hear. All serious studies done by different universities and doctors are concluding that that due to how close the ear-buds are present to the eardrum, they effectively magnify the sound by between 6 and 9 decibels compared with traditional over-ear headphones. Unlike headphones that go around the ear, these go inside the ear canal and can be louder because you're projecting that sound into a much smaller cavity with the ear speakers closer to your inner ear where we have a delicate system of sensory cells that are responsible for initiating the hearing process. Those cells are very, very sensitive to noise damage. Earbuds allow sounds in the environment to leak in, often causing the user to turn up the volume.",146,70
Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"I bought these because I travel a lot and like to listen to music, books, etc in the plane. The sound on these are good for the money. When inserted into the ear, they do a good job of muffling most of the ambient noise. One complaint: the silicone earbuds will become dislodged and can be lost easily.

Recently I lost one of the silione earbuds during a flight. Could use the earphone without them but it was very uncomfortable. Sony charges $8.95 for a SINGLE large earbud and $6.95 for a SINGLE small or medium.

That's a little on the ridiculous for a small piece of silicone that costs mere pennies to produce; not to mention you don't even get a pair. They are hard to find also. I found a company called Audiocube that sells a pair for $10. Better than $14 Sony wants but still expensive. Shipping is $7 in US so you're out $17 if you want a pair for backup.",165,71

Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"I bought these earphones based on the Amazon rating, and have unfortunately been very disappointed. I wear them primarily at the gym with my iPod Nano.  While the sound quality is very good, unfortunately they do not stay put, and I am constantly having to fiddle with them to stay on.  The ""loop"" is just too big for my ears, so when I put the ear bud into my ear, the loop part sits way above and outside my ear; not snugly fitting.  There is no way to adjust them, unfortunately, and it only gets worse when I sweat during a workout because then they are sliding off!!  I also paid full price for them at the time (January '06), and now they are discounted, but even at that price, they are of no use to me.  I'm now in the market (again) for a set of earphones with good sound quality that are also a good fit for me.  Any suggestions are welcome!",164,77

It is worth every penny. You can get better noise cancelling headphones but they are bulky and north of 100 bucks.,54,80
Electronics,B0007N55LE,2.0,negative,"The sound quality is tinny. The treble range is fine, but the bass response is absurdly bad. To listen with these things is like  leaving out entire instruments.

Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"The sound quality is excellent, don't get me wrong.  These earphones put out clear treble, deep bass (without washing everything else out) and have a well balanced tone that I have not found in most other headphones I have used.  The backround sound cancellation from the in-ear style is not perfect, but does a better job than most earphones.  My biggest problem: the fit!  I opted for the over-the-ear style because I thought it would be better for an active lifestyle, and this would be true if they actually fit me where my ears are.  The length of the earpiece is not adjustable so if your ear varies at all from the size they make, they simply don't work.  In my case (others may have different a experience) the actual ear piece almost hits my earlobe - almost an inch too far down for these to fit right.  Huge mistake not making them adjustable Sony.  Bad Bad Bad design.  It is a real shame because the sound quality would have made these some of the best headphones I have used.",180,82
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"I am not an ""audiophile"" - I just need headphones that do a decent job of isolating me from external sounds and that are very mobile.  So I can't comment too much on how perfect the sound is from the Sony's.  But my amateur opinion is that they sound great!  The sound isolation is not too bad, but not too great either.  I'd say they attenuate incoming external noise by about 50%.

I own a pair of Etymotics ER*4 MicroPro Earphones (cost: $300) and the Sony MDR-EX81LP's a have much deeper bass response. I use the Etymotics correctly (i.e. press them ALL the way into your ear until your feel that sucking feeling...), and when I do so I can barely hear what's going on around me.  So the Etymotics are much better than the Sony's for sound isolation.

I haven't had a problem with the cords or durability, but I've only used the headphones about 10 times (no visible wear so far).

I love them and am glad I bought them. I prefer to use them when total sound isolation isn't necessary.",183,83
Electronics,B0007N55LE,5.0,positive,"Great fit and sound.  Does not work well with a cell phone adapter (2.5mm to 1.5mm).  Do not buy for a cell phone, but only for a device that uses 2.5mm.",31,84

Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"These earphones are awesome. They are far superior to anything you would get OEM with your MP3 player or other audio device. It takes a little time to get used to these earphones and getting them to fit comfortably, however, once you do they don't fall out and sound great before, during, and after workout. The only disadvantage seems to be the shorter cord to the left ear. This is designed so that the main cord goes down on the side of your body rather than your chest, but takes a little while to get used to and to hide the cord away in your clothing.

I wish the cord was shorter like with other Sony earphones so that I could plug it into my in-line remote and not have a 2.2m long cord, but without a remote these are a great length for just about any type of use.",150,86

Electronics,B0007N55LE,4.0,positive,"Let me start by saying that I'm pleased.  These phones definitely have improved bass response compared to the last ones (61's) that I had from Sony... but they have definitely sacrificed some of the clarity you would expect from the stuck-in-your-ear type earbuds.

The pros: The carrying case (after i figured it out) is very cool.  The over-ear hooks are nice.  They fit very good and block out a lot of the outside noise.  Decent Bass repsonse.

The cons: The technology that Sony has implemented in these earbuds definitely improves bass response, but it comes at the cost of some clarity.

There are three options for the pads, so you will find one that fits. I was concerned from the picture that the bar that hangs down and connects the ear hook to the earbud was too long.  It's not adjustable, but it isn't an issue.  The design makes these very adjustable and comfortable.  Also, if you have only heard your Ipod on the standard earbuds, you are in for a treat.  The sound out of these is just fantastic, so much better than the original earbuds.  The price I paid was about the same as buy.com but Amazon was shipping for free, so this is a better deal.  I strongly recommend these for anyone who wants comfortable earbuds, with a marked improvement in sound at a very reasonable price.  I can't wait to hit the slopes with them!  Enjoy.",156,101
Electronics,B0007N55LE,1.0,negative,"First, I bought these because I HATE earbuds inserted into my ear, so I thought the over the ear feature would be great. However, the sound quality from these is very weak. The stock iPod earbuds have a much fuller and richer sound. To get any usable sound, I have to pretend these are ear plugs and shove them as far into my ear canal as possible, which is exactly what I hate. Even then, the sound is hollow and tinny.

Second, the over the ear feature doesn't work for snot. I cannot get the freaking loop to fit over my ear and have the earbud in a comfortable position in my ear at the same time. Plus, this is a non-adjustable element. I think my ears are a pretty average size and shape, but I can't use them. I guess it doesn't matter anyhow, since  the sound quality is so poor.

The sound is great from these headphones although the volume the headphones produce is lesser than what my iPod earbuds produce.  For the most part this is OK.  The only time this is an issue for me is when I am on an airplane - announcements from flight attendants and from the cockpit drown out the volume even when my iPod is at the highest levels.

The only thing I do not like about these headphones is the earpieces have different length cords before reaching the single cord that goes to the mp3 player (or whatever you are listening to).  This is picky I know but it makes it difficult to wrap up the headphones and requires that I strap my iPod Nano on my left arm when I run.

For the gym: They don't sit in your ear very well if you're running, and you need to push them back in when they are getting loose.

If you're just sitting around, they are ok, but they still seem to fall out. The flaw in the design is that the piece that goes behind your ear is non-conforming. This means that it retains the shape it had when it came out of the box. When I bought these, I thought the could be bent to stay in a certain shape, but that didn't hold true.

If I wear them as they were intended, inside the ear canal, then the ear piece sticks out from my ear where it serves no purpose.

My current favorites are some inexpensive ones branded Phillips (though I have seen other company's names on the same model) but I have been unable to find them recently, so I got these Sony's to try.  Big disappointment.

The sound is really quite poor.  It is tinny and high, almost piercing at higher volumes, and totally lacks bass.  Plugging my old earbuds into the same device without adjusting the volume and comparing it to these Sonys just underscores how poorly these perform.

The fit is also lacking.  When running, there is nothing which breaks the revery of hitting your stride like constantly having to shove an earphone back in your ear.  They hang over your ear like overcooked linguini. I could even excuse the poor sound quality if they stayed put for more than 1/4 mile of running.

But if you use them alot, they quickly fall apart and break (and thats from daily use, not from abuse). The cord is made out of some fabric that, as another reviewer said, almost seems to dissolve. It's like a stretchy form of rubber that quickly splits and rips.

And where the cord meets the actual rubber that goes behind your ear, the cord rips and breaks off from the earbud, and the only thing keeping it intact is the wire itself.

First off, you need to stick this in your ears properly else you won't get good fidelity.  Sound is generally well-balanced.  Bass is not booming (this is good), but treble is still a bit overemphasized which leads to crackling (typical of cheap 'phones).  Volume is lower than most cheapos -- which can mean a lot of things -- but still acceptable.

Ergonomics are good: the buds fit in the ears nicely, provides good isolation to outside noise.  I don't know how comfortable these are for sports, since sweat inside the ear canal gets annoying.  For other things they're pretty good: though you're not gonna forget you're wearing them, it's like wearing silicone earplugs (which I do for swimming for a prolonged period of time, so it can't be that bad).

Overall, a good value, but not quite there yet.  I'm not spending $100+ for the Shures, so I'm just gonna keep looking for my whale.  I'm giving it 5* because it fulfills my expectation of what $30 can get me.",187,149

They just kept falling off, which would jerk me awake as I was drifting off to sleep. Since they slipped off after five or so minutes when I was sleeping, I cannot imagine how awful they would be if used during physical activity. I found the sound quality to be fairly abysmal as well; there was an omnipresent tinny sound that I constantly heard over the three days that I used them.

In addition, the remote isn't too fancy, but the unit has excellent controls accessible from the remote for controlling things like picture size, jpeg playback, etc.",125,8
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,"We have been very pleased with our purchase.  I found reading the previous reviews to be accurate and very helpful.  Very easy to hook-up, will work on old television sets, DVD and VHS work well, VHS is more noisy when rewinding.  We bought this for our children to watch movies and just use the most basic features, so it has suited our needs well.  If looking for all bells and whistles would probably choose higher end model, but if looking to stay simple and basic I would choose this model.",90,9

Electronics,B000EBPJFG,4.0,positive,"I really haven't had this unit long enough to give an in depth evaluation of this product. For me it was somewhat difficult to set up. However, I have always had problems setting up VCR's throughout my VCR buying history. After consulting with a knowledgeable friend on how to kick this thing into gear, the unit appears to work very nicely. Once you understand the total setup, it is quite easy and simple to operate. I gave this a 4 star rating because I believe this VCR/DVD combo will do just fine. The only negative is that it will only record to the channel you are watching. For the price however, I can live with that.",116,11
Electronics,B000EBPJFG,2.0,negative,"I bought this product to replace my old Sony SLV-D300P dvd/vcr combo thinking that it would be more compatible with my Toshiba TV than the Sony. This was not the case, as the remote that comes with this dvd/vcr combo DOES NOT CONTROL THE TV AT ALL! There is no way to program the remote to control anything other than the dvd/vcr player. If you buy this product, be ready to use your TV remote or put in some extra money to buy a universal remote. In addition, the user interface of the player is horrible - much worse than my old Sony. I returned this the day after I bought it and exchanged it for the Sony SLV-D370P, which includes a remote to control the TV and has a great user interface. I gave this 2 stars because for the few minutes I used it, the audio/video quality was fine and the product has DIVX playback compatibility, which was one of the reasons I bought it in the first place.",171,12

I see a lot of people complaiining about the volume and not being able to hear it. I do not have that problem mine is extremely loud and I have to keep it turned off the maximum because it is blowing me away.

Electronics,B000P3ZPC0,5.0,positive,"I got this GPS unit last week, and for an entry price range unit, I was really blown away by the performance and functionality of this unit.  This unit only takes about 5 to 10 seconds to acquire satellites and locate my position, and I love the ability to select major road as a route option and the ability to navigate by higher level view or zoom in to local streets.

In the high level view, I really like that every street is named so I really know what's around me, and I can really see where I'm going.  When I pull off route into a McDonald, the GPS recalculate my route in seconds when I get back on the road. I haven't tried out the MP3 player or the photo viewer yet, I am sure it work fine but I really don't need this unit for those function anyhow.

I've owned and use other navigation products from the Tom Tom One, to Mio C220, and even the Garmin Nuvi 360, I like this GPS unit the best.  This product really exceed my expectation, so I highly recommend this product.",190,4

I DON'T KNOW!...WHY DO YOU NEED THAT?...and they say, OH, I NEED TO PUT IT IN MY GPS AND THEN THE TOWN OR WHATEVER,....please, ARE U KIDDING ME?....nobody has time for all of that, and besides I work in a lot of different places so half the time I wouldn't know the damn zip codes.....Now with this wizard of a tool, by default your city is already in there unless your changing it but all you do then is throw in the street name  and then the street number, it then gives you the list of all the towns in alphabetical order and you just pick it out and it goes!!!!!....NO ZIP CODE NEEDED!!...This is every bit worth the cash and more!",174,5

I said I understood that they were no longer required to repair my unit for free...I was interested in what the cost would be to repair it.  NO SUCH OPTION:  they said after the warranty expires, Nextar does not accept units for repairs.  If I wanted to try to get it fixed, try local computer repair shops in my area.

However, I would have to say buyer be warned. I had mine for a year and just short of the warrantee it died. One day it worked the next it would not go passed the splash screen. I would say it was my bad luck but in researching it online I found quite a few others had the same problem, some shortly after they purchased it. Nextar has a lifetime exchange program but the price is about $140 which is more then I paid new. They originally told me they would fix it but the supervisor turned it down because I lack a good reason. Standing by there product is not a good enough reason.  it is also my understanding that even under warrantee Nexter requires you to pay for return shipping on your repair both way.

No map updates - my maps are over 4 years old and Nextar has no plans to update.

Unit also locks constantly - have to keep pressing the RESET button in order to get it to half-way function.  Buy something else - I would purchase this unit if it was $5 dollars",112,12

It's off my camera and I won't be putting it back on.
I would not recommend this product for purchase.",98,0

No, I never have liked silver cameras, but I got it from my sister, so it wasn't entirely my fault. I mean, its almost better than nothing... Anyway, I got this ""armor"" not to protect my camera, but because it looks a whole lot better than bare silver, granted it doesn't make the camera awesomely black, but at least I can say I tried without braking the bank.
It does add to the grip a bit as well.
So if you liked silver, then found out after the fact that it wasn't really ""in"", this is a good way to cover your mistake. Trust me there are not a whole lot of people out there dying to buy your silver camera(or trade for black), so go head and at least try it.",144,3

- in installing it one rubber piece snapped because it's really skinny and was extended too much as I was fitting the body armour on my camera. It's the piece that goes between the flash and the dial, it's really skinny and fragile
- Overall the armour is not snug enough, I was expectibg it to really be a snug fit arond the camera body. It's not the case, it's a little too loose and you feel you don't have a good grip of the camera because of it
- the bottom piece holds to the rest of the body armour with rubber tabs. These tabs keep coming out and I have to constantly put the tabs back in place.
- Feels really cheap but it's inexpensive after all
- The lens hood protector pice does not fit a 77 mm as advertised
- The bottom pice has to be completely taken out to replace the battery

SO yes inexpensive but you get what you pay for",184,4

Electronics,B000ZLULOY,1.0,negative,"I purchased the Camera Armor through Amazon for my Canon XSI last year, at the same time that I bought my new camera.  I have been very disappointed in the Camera Armor.  It does not fit my camera well.  The Armor makes it difficult to operate some of the features on the camera. The extensions on bottom piece easily slip out of the slits in the main part of the Armor that are intended to hold it in place; the bottom piece of the Armor falls off easily.  This is aggravating!  The part that would protect the lens is bulky, and I have not been using it.  Some areas of my camera, specifically the LED screen and the pop-up flash, as well as the buttons and dial, are not protected at all by using the Armor.

So, get to know your camera's buttons a little before putting on the armor. The lense hood is too small for my Canon 28-135 USM lense.  The only surprise was that I have to remove the base covering to replace the battery.  I'm thinking of buying a second one for future use because i plan to keep my T1i for a long time.

 However, it's not going to hold EVERYTHING. The description says ""up to 12 rolls,"" but I was only able to fit 8 large size rolls of wrapping paper. I still give it five stars, though, because who really needs more than 8 rolls of wrapping paper?

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"This has been a life saver for closet organization. I was able to fit 10 rolls of wrapping paper(5 each side), multiple gift bags, lots of tissue paper, rolls of tape and even leftover favors in the many pockets.",39,36
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,like it a lot.  Doesn't use floor space in the closet and can hold quite a bit of different wrapping material.,21,37
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,Awful. This doesn't even work. Don't waste your time or money.,11,38
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,Only fits smaller rolls of wrapping paper so not very practical for what it's intended to do.,17,39

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"I love this thing. I had a whole dresser full of ribbons, bows, cards, gift bags and wrapping paper that I packed into this thing (minus one bag of bows...but seriously, I had waaaaay too much). Now everything is easily accessible and visible, so I know NOT TO BUY ANY MORE BOWS and can easily wrap a present. My favorite part are the dedicated scissor and tape pockets on the side because I was always scrambling for these two tools.",80,41
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,Really like them. I used 2 to. Organize wrapping Iarea. Works well. Would  recommend it,15,42
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"Love this! Works perfectly for all my wrapping needs I have it stuffed with paper, bags, cards,  bows, etc. No problem with it trying to tear or fall. Hangs neatly in my closet and helps keep every thing organized.",39,43

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"Helps me to organize my wrappers, ribbons, gift boxes, gift cards and small bags... in one space hanged behind my door. However, I don't really like the quality of the sewing and the way the compartments are designed... They don't seem to close properly due to the bad fitting and workmanship. Things may fall out... So I would say this item is overpriced due to its poor workmanship. But idea wise, I m sold. I love to organize.",78,47

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,It is amazing how much stuff you can get in this organizer.  And hanging over the door of a spare room closet really makes the best use of your space.  I will definitely buy another one in the future,39,49
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,Doesn't hang straight up and down with longer rolls of paper. Great for short rolls. I wouldn't recommend.,18,50
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,I am not crazy out it...quite flimsy and does not hold very much.,13,51
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Horrible, only 6 rolls in and it hangs lopsided! The Velcro straps don't even come close to holding the rolls in as they are located towards the bottom half. Poor design and cheaply made. Even the hanger is cheap, so thin, waste of money",44,52
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,I bought this and its companion (Gift Bag Organizer) to get my wrapping out from under my bed and hang it up in a utility closet we have. It worked great! I don't have a crazy amount of wrapping paper rolls though. I would say it maxes out at about 4-6 depending on the diameter of your rolls?,58,53
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"The product arrived on time, but there was no built-in hangar even though it is described as such. There is a series of snaps at the top where a hangar could be placed and removed, but the snaps couldn't fit around any closet pole and I don't have a hangar wide enough to fit the whole top width. Then the compartments shown in the middle of the organizer are just cheap plastic walls with no white finishing stitching/fabric as indicated in the picture. The result is a much cheaper design than what is pictured and described when purchasing. there is no way to secure those compartments closed and no stiffness to the plastic to remain closed themselves. I will likely be returning this product.",124,54
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"Good idea, but it doesn't hold the longer rolls ...",10,55
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,I was very disappointed with the gift wrap organizer. The plastic was cheap and flimsy. This product is just poorly designed. I placed 6 rolls of paper equally divided and the whole thing wobbled and hung lopsided. Even the hanger seemed like it was strained from my measly 6 rolls of paper. I plan on returning it.,57,56
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,One thing to note as that depending on how much paper you include the holder does not stand up straight in the closet.,23,57
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,works great ! we needed to clean up the disorganized mess we had.,13,58
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,as advertised.  made my closet more user friendly!,8,59
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,It was terrible and cheap. and it did not even come with a hanger to hang it up with. It went in the trash. Easier than shipping it back,29,60
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,It ended up in the trash... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,11,61
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,Dont wste your money.  Too small and extremely poor quality.,10,62
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,Didn't hold as much as I was hoping.  Jumbo rolls are too tall but it is nice to have it hanging out if the way.,25,63
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"It doesnt come with a hanger. We tried using one of our hangers but it was too.heavy, hanger would break or bend. We tried putting 2 hangers to support the weight but the buttons won't close. A sturdy thick metal hanger should be included with this product.",47,64
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,Once you put wrapping paper rolls in the side pockets they fall forward. There needs to be a rigid back to this thing. It's really junk and does not work at all.,32,65
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"It does an OK job holding the paper rolls although its a bit unweilding to get in and out of a closet.  The pockets on the front are, virtually, useless.  Pick another product",33,66
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I really like this organizer and I really like how little space it takes up.  It is about as wide as a hanging shoe organizer.  It sits in the back of my hall closet and I like that when I pull the whole thing out to get what I need, it doesn't dump anything out of its compartments.  The compartments are spacious and numerous and I like that I no longer have a crumpled mess of unusable wrapping paper or a hard storage system taking up space under the bed or closet.",92,67
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"I received another brand as a gift at christmas and could not find it to order another, so I ordered this one.  The snaps constantly unsnap and it falls in the closet from the weight.  The other one I own does not do this.  Would not buy this one again.",50,68
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I love wrapping gifts and making them beautiful for the receiver, but I have always disliked having to store wrapping paper and supplies in awkward containers that hide under the bed or in the attic. This works well, hanging from the door in my home-office where it is easy to get to and out of the way. I like having everything I need in one place and not having to worry about the kids getting into it or it taking up valuable office space.",84,69
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I wish I would've read the reviews... I wouldn't have paid more than $5 for this if I'd seen it in a store and here I paid 20. It is so cheap I didn't even bother putting anything in it. I just just printed out the return receipt. Other than it being cheap, it definitely shows a hanger at the top yet when I took this out of the package I saw it folds down at the top and snaps with nothing to hang it on. I'm extremely disappointed and mad at myself for buying it.",96,70
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,This is not the highest quality product (the plastic is very thin and flimsy) but still functions and is very useful for getting organized.,24,71
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"it was cheap, and I returned it. there was no way to even hang it, and the material was not up to my expectation.",24,72
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,I haven't hung it yet but it appears that it will serve it's purpose well. It is smaller than I expected but that was reported by a previous buyer so I was not disappointed.,34,73
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,I would not recommend this gift wrap organizer.  There are pouches behind the place where you would stand your tubes of wrapping paper that don't seem to serve a purpose and the front pouches for bows and such would work better if they had velcro to keep them closed but they don't so it all falls out.,57,74
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Terrible! It fooled me because it looked like it was a pretty awesome product. But I put two medium size rolls in it and it fell over. It a silly design, it would need to have wrapping paper spots on the other side to even it out.",47,75
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"At first I really couldn't tell if it was worth it . But to my surpise it holds all my ribbons wrapping paper boxes, and more ! Great work horse",30,76
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,It's ok for everything but the wrapping paper.  It leans forward like the paper is going to fall out of it.,21,77
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,I did not request a refund or return this item in fairness to the seller. This doesn't work at all. The pockets don't hold stuff at all and are really terrible. It doesn't sit up-right like it shows and I really wish I had not ordered mine. I would never ever had done so and I hope that you will take my advice!,63,78
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"This item looks much better in the picture than in person. The unit arrived without ""built-in hanger"" as advertised or any instructions. Very disappointed because I specifically purchased to hang in a closet.",33,79
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Very flimsy, cheap material. I don't even use it and sadly took too long to return it. My bad. The picture presents a highly organized tool, but the reality is that it barely holds anything and everything droops. Hideous piece of junk.",42,80
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,The description and photograph showed a hanger at the top.  There was none. I returned it and found one elsewhere to meet my needs.,24,81
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"There should be a place to put wrapping paper on the other side, too, for balance, but there isn't. Seems common sense? How are gift bags supposed to equalize the weight of wrapping paper tubes? Not very intuitive. The areas for storing ribbons and bows are flat and shapeless. It doesn't protrude like the picture. If you store this in a full closet, your ribbons and bows will probably get crushed or wonky.",73,82
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"First of all, mine doesn't have a hanger.  It has velcro, which means it hangs horizontally and takes up way too much space instead of thinking I could slide it in as if it were clothes.  Secondly, it's not secure - just flimsy open spaces that don't close so things just fall out.

Don't waste your time and effort trying to organize with this.  It's not functional and costs too much.",71,83
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,Love love love love this! Good quality plastic. Strong enough to hold all my wrapping supplies. I am finally organized!,20,84
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"This is actually the second one of these I've owned. I don't remember where I purchased the first one, and after many years of use it broke.  The plastic on this one seems a little thinner, but I still think I'll get  extended use from it. The storage is arranged very well. There are pockets on the back where I store tissue paper and gift bags. There are side pockets just behind the wrapping paper rolls where I store gift tags and shrink wrap bags. It even has special pockets for scissors and tape.",94,85
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"Great to have in the closet for all my present making supplies. It actually fits alot inside, more than I thought. Definitely worth it.",24,86
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,This is perfect for all my wrapping paper. I liked the back pockets on the unit as well. Between this and the gift bag organizer from Jokari everything has a place now.,32,87
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,This is a waste of money. Made with cheap materials. When I got this home it was already ripped.  I should have read the comments before purshasing. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!,31,88
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"I was in such a rush to get the gift wrap supplies organized that I bought the one organizer that I thought would fit the bill. I received it today and preceded to fill it up. I am surprised that Amazon would sell something so flimsy. Disappointed in the poor quality of the cheapo plastic. Smaller than the posted photo and does not hold much at all. I have a feeling that it may start to rip on its own, as it hangs there, I will then return it.",89,89
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I does not match up with one I previously had (it wore out). This one has no place for long rolls of paper, and I find those pocikets are about useless for anything.",33,90
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,I love this!  I only wish there was a larger pocket at the top like the 3 at the bottom.  I also wish it carried more wrapping paper...only 12 rolls:(,30,91
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"This organizer is just right for the average family. There's room for multiple rolls and spools of ribbon, with slots on one side for bags and small boxes. Unless you're a real pack-rat, this organizer should suit you needs.",39,92
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,Daughter wanted it for her birthday. She had picked it out. She hasn't said that she doesn't like it. Nice,20,93
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I was surprised at the quality on this. The hanger is not plastic, and it swivels easily. The compartments are roomy enough for about eight rolls of wrapping paper. I love the fact that I can hang it in the back of the closet where it's hidden away. I figure if it tears a little over the years, I'll just make pretty flowers out of colored duct tape to strengthen. I think this is perfect for my needs. Highly recommend.",80,94
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"The hanging gift wrap organizer is wonderful. I have it hanging in a closet and it's very handy to go to when looking for gift wrap, ribbons etc. I think I'm going to get a couple more for x-mas paper.",40,95
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,Barely holds anything without squishing it and it leans over taking up more space. Would not recommend. Don't waste your money,21,96
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,This gift wrap organizer is a little on the flimsy side but there are no tears or rips in it and it is convenient to just being hung up in a closet when Minot in use! I do love it because all my wrapping needs are placed within this organizer,50,97
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"Buyer beware.  When I finally received this via the mail, it was jammed into a mail slot and appeared much smaller than it does in the picture.  It is very cheaply made and the reinforcements you see on the middle pouches (the white strips on the openings) are not present.  I will be inquiring about a full refund for this item.",61,98
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I really use this alot.  I wish it had more space for tissue paper and gift bags.  It would be nicer if it had snaps on the ribbon
pockets.  If you don't have everything distributed properly it hangs forward.",39,99
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"This picture looks great however this is made of the same plastic that the throw away bag it comes in is...  The best thing I can say for this is that it was returnable, even though I lost shipping money.",40,100
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"It seems sturdy enough so far,  I like the different pockets.  It was a little difficult to figure out where everything goes.",22,101
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I wasn't able to put ANY wrapping paper in this organizer... its mainly meant for gift bags, bows and smaller items. I was upset since the picture advertises that it can hold wrapping paper, again it is made out of cheap plastic but it at least can hold some things.",50,102
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,I hate it when they send a similar item. I did not get same item. FIrst it was black and second it did not have a hanger built in on top. It has 5 button snaps instead. Annoying.,38,103
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"It has enough room for most of my gift wrap materials, and it doesn't take up much space. I like it!",21,104
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"This item is cheaply made. The plastic is very thin and flimsy. The opening to the areas to hold ribbon is a cut in the plastic. After use, I am certain this opening will continue to rip. Additionally, the area to hold the rolls of wrapping paper is not adjustable. Therefore, the rolls fall forward and make the entire organizer fall to one side. I would not recommend this product- especially at this price point. I have since purchased another at half this price and it is made with thick plastic and compartments with zippers.",95,105
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"Made from really cheap plastic. Really really cheap plastic. The hook hanger head isn't curved long enough,  so when you hang it it may fall off your rod. This will work better if hangs flat against a wall. If you have tall wrapping paper....this won't fit in your regular standard closet. It could work on the back of a door.",60,106
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,2.0,negative,"It does what it's supposed to do, but it's very flimsy, and most of the compartments are not as roomy as I was expecting. Definitely not worth 20 bucks.",29,107
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"If you're in the market for a gift wrap organizer, I encourage you to move past this low quality item. DO NOT BUY. I would barely pay $5 for this organizer, it was so incredibly cheaply made and NOTHING like the picture suggested. It's TINY and the pockets won't hold anything because they have these gigantic slits in them (presumably for easy access, but they don't hold ribbons and other wrapping accoutrements well because everything just falls out!). Very poor design and another cheap ""made in China"" product.",88,108
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I'm trying to organize my space and this item was a very big disappointment. It fell apart upon trying to fit items into the areas as displayed in the photo-packaging. The organizer was easily torn and did not balance well with items loaded as displayed in picture on package. The retaining straps for the vertical rolls of paper were too long and droop allowing the paper rolls to fall forward and pull out of the organizer. The areas for bows allow bows to fall out. The area for rolls of ribbon are difficult to fill and the material is easily torn. Actual use of the item is difficult; replacing items after use tore the ""assigned"" compartment even more.
I'm looking for another storage solution, this one did not work.",129,109
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Very disappointed in this product. Cheaply made and very flimsy.  I pulled this out last night, excited to start organizing and saw that 2 of the front pockets had rips across the plastic. Wouldn't recommmend wasting money on this item!",40,110
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I purchased this to organize scattered Christmas wrapping supplies.  Unfortunately, this looks a lot better in the picture than it does in real life.  It also doesn't work well at all.  Once you put wrapping paper in the side areas that hold wrapping paper, there is no real way to secure it tightly so that it doesn't flop around.  The hanger also can't take a lot of weight on it.  I tried two medium wrapping paper rolls on each side and some tape and bows in the middle section. It wouldn't stay up and hung kind of lopsided. Right now it is laying down and barely holding it's contents. I'm going to have to switch to a different wrapping paper organizer.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. :(",128,111
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Very disappointed. I bought one of these exact style of organizer over 10 years ago for $11.00. It had served me well for this long and just recently the plastic began to tear. So I felt that It would be a good value to get another one. This one that arrived...that I paid twice as much for is so cheap and flimsy that I doubt it will last two  years.  The plastic is so thin that it won't even stand up straight enough to support rolls of wrap...and this is while it is hanging, I have to tie a scarf around the whole thing to keep the rolls of wrap from hanging in all directions. The slide pockets in the back are oddly small and I cannot even fit my sheets of gift tags in them. This was a complete waste of money and I wish I had not bought it. Keeping my old one for when this one falls to pieces. Don't waste your money.",166,112
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"Maybe I wasn't realistic purchasing this item.  For the price I didn't expect it to be attractive or super high quality, but I didn't expect it to be as cheaply constructed as it was either.  It's a very thin plastic that rips easily.  The ""pockets"" that are designed to hold bows have the opening on the front...sort of like a portable tissue pack, so you when you hang it they aren't on the top and the bows can fall out.  Plus, the weight of the wrapping paper rolls (and I only loaded in 5 it wasn't like I tried to fill it) pull the entire thing forward when it's hung so the plastic starts to tear and every time you touch it things fall out.  Great idea, poorly designed.  Don't waste your money on this one!",136,113
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"This is a great thing for getting wrapping paper contained, along with all the other things that go with it.  The organizer is two sided so you can store on both sides and hand it in a closet and access either side!  Such a great idea.",46,114
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,The hanging gift wrap organizer works very nice with everything you would have for wrapping packages.  Very neat and more sturdy then expected.  You still have to be careful with the plastic compartments.  They hold just about everything you can think of very well.  Saves space too.,47,115
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"I just received it today. I was able to fit in 5 rolls of wrapping paper that I had, all my cards, tape, LOTS of bows, few rolls of ribbons I had, scissors - everything. There was space for everything. It's hanging in my closet and everything is accessible easily. Since I just got it today, I don't know about the longevity. When I first opened it, I thought the front pockets had tears in them. But actually that's the opening to access the pockets.",85,116
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,"I used to have a tall plastic container for my gift wrapping supplies. While it was slightly better than storing all of my wrapping items in paper bags, it left me more frustrated than anything. Extra long wrapping paper didn't fit, bows got squished... You get the idea. I have just organized all of my supplies in this hanging organizer, and I am so impressed. It holds everything, even that too tall wrapping paper. The mountain of gift bags that I have acquired now have a home on the back of the organizer. I used a 3M hook to hang the organizer on the inside of the coat closet door. I plan to check out other organizing items from this company.

1.19.14 update
Looks like the reviews are quite mixed about this product. I've had mine since early 2011 and it's still working great. I think that hanging it as described in the initial review really helps decrease the wear and tear on the item. I agree with other reviewers that the materials to make this product could be improved upon (maybe something canvas?), but I'm still happy with it as is.",192,117
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"I had the previous model. It wery well made with fabric netting, and I love it. Needed one more.
Found it is now made only in plastic.
Ordered it, Amazon sent it quickly. The thing looks and feels like a cheap thing. I would need to use a hair dryer to soften the plastic compartments into shape ( or hang it outside on a hot day).
BUT HERE IS THE REALLY BIG PROBLEM.
 IT IS MISSING THE CARDBOARD STIFFENERS THAT THIS CHEAP VERSION NEEDS TO MAKE THE PLASTIC COMPARTMENTS HAVE A USABLE SHAPE.
Yeah, assembly is required. BUT THE STIFFENERS ARE NOT IN THE PACKAGE.
So I notified Amazon I needed a replacement. The new one arrived lightning quick.
IT HAS NO STIFFENERS EITHER.
The item is useless and I have had it.
So I am just returning it for a refund. I cannot see re-ordering the item. Obviously a batch of these things was shipped without the needed pieces.
I am not a happy camper.",166,118
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"Item shipped extremely fast ~ Great item for organizing gift wrap stuff (which was what I purchased it for) ~ would be even better if it could hold more than 1 roll of gift wrap on each side in their respective pouches.  Other than that, a great product!",48,119
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,This product met all of our needs.  The storage is extensive for the size of the product and it's organized well.  The fact that you can place this in a closet and have it take little room is just great!

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,5.0,positive,Get rid of the clutter and get this awesome thing!!  I had one of those under-the-bed rubber maid things before buying this and it was awkward and clumsy and everything was always a mess inside.  I LOVE this item!!  You can take it out of the closet and lay it out on the table or bed and everything is easily accesible.  You can take it anywhere you need to or just leave it in the closet (where it takes up minimal space) and access what you need in a snap!  There are pockets for everything.  BUY IT.,97,121
Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I bought the Jokari gift wrap organizer amid much scorn from my family for my consumer habits.  But now everyone at my house is so pleased I went ahead and made the investment.  This organizer is similar to one of those closet shoe organizers, only this one works!  It is flat, made mostly of clear plastic, and hangs off the integrated hanger to fit in your coat closet.  The front of the organizer is flat, with two long vertical pockets on either side which hold about 4 rolls of wrapping paper each.  Between these two wrapping paper pockets are three small pockets which hold  ribbons,  gift tags, cards, scissors etc.  On the back of organizer are three somewhat larger pockets, which you can use to hold gift bags and similar larger flattish items

 All of our Christmas and birthday wrapping items are stored, hanging flat, in an easily accessible closet.  The translucent plastic ensure that you can easily find what you need.  If you have a coat closet that can handle one more thin object on a hanger, and are looking to store 6 to 8 rolls of wrapping paper,and wouldn't mind some related items with them, I highly recommend this hanging organizer.",203,122

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,1.0,negative,"This product tore the moment I took it out of the box. I read all of the reviews that warned of similar ease of tearing but thought I'd simply be more ginger with it. It practically ripped to the touch. It was impossible to even unfold it, let alone put anything in it, without the plastic tearing at the folds, or the pockets or velcro tearing away from the piece itself.
It's too small for my purposes, as well, but that's subject to personal needs. I will say that the center compartments for storing bows and ribbon are too stiff to open enough to fit bows in without crushing them.
Overall, the primary and pretty much the only necessary thing to mention is that it didn't last a half second upon arrival. $20 down the drain.",136,124

Home_and_Kitchen,B0001Z8SB2,4.0,positive,"I really love this product, and if I could give it 4 and a half stars, I would. I wish the material was more eco-friendly, but I bought it anyway.  The only real problems are: lack of accommodation for large (tall) rolls of ribbon, the tape compartment fits only the smallest tape dispenser (doesn't fit a normal 3M Gift Wrap tape dispenser), and the ""card"" pockets are too small.  Otherwise, the design is great and I like it much more than the Rubbermaid giftwrap bin we used previously.

The first time I used it I noticed the lid didn't fit properly and was deformed. When I picked it up by the handles a big piece of the left handle broke off in my hand.

I also use it to make casseroles, and it's great for that. The pan is well balanced and the heat evenly distributed. The glass lid is vented, which is the main reason I bought it.  The pan itself cannot be washed in the diswasher but the non-stick surface makes it a breeze to clean.  You can wash the glass lid in the dishwasher if you prefer but it 's not that hard to wash by hand, either.  The price is also reasonable and after my nearly $200,  electric, top name, skillet started malfunctioning after less than three years, I decided to replace it with this one and I'm so glad I did.",139,4

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"This is a very thin and light weight comforter.  Much thinner than expected, but the price was right.  Looks very nice on the bed.  It takes a few weeks for the wrinckles to come out.  Shams are standard size even with the king set.  Good buy.",46,2
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I was hesitant to buy these at first when I saw it in the gold box. But then I said why the heck not. My hesitation was due to the fact that I had way too many comforters. However, these were the first that I ever bought for myself. The other ones were given to me as gifts. This comforter is extremely warm and yet light at the same time. I still need an extra blanket as usual since I can get very cold but it's a lot better than my old comforter. Like some other reviews said, the pillow shams are pretty small but it's fine for smaller pillows.

A word of advice: most likely, your comforter will arrive extremely.. and I mean EXTREMELY staticy most likely due to the lack of moisture in the box. The solution I have found is to sprinkle some water on the comforter or to spray some febreze on it. Not only would it help to make it smell better but also gets rid of a bit of static electricity. So be careful when taking the comforter out and enjoy!",187,3
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I bought this comforter in the olive shade & it's GORgeous! It's also soft, light & very warm 'n cozy! The hubby 'n I LOVE it! Sadly, however, the cats (at least one of 'em) don't!  This thing is LOADED w/static!  If you touch it in the middle of the night, you can see blue sparks! My lil furry guy was acting all weird & didn't want to jump up in bed w/us per usual.  When he finally did, he stood @ the edge of the mattress.  I unknowingly pulled him against me on the blanket.  Welp, blue sparks flew off him & he went a-runnin. So, sadly, I can't really use this blanket unless we're purposely trying to keep him outta bed (if ya know what I mean LOL). ;o)",131,4
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I bought this as a deal of the day special for $39. For that price, it's OK, but I would never pay full price. The pillow shams are too small, and the king size is too small for my king size matress. I can use it as an individual comforter, but then I'll have to dry clean (preferred) or launder it more frequently. The cover does not come off the feather/down insides - it's one piece. That makes it a pain in my posterior.

The cover is very soft, and the chocolate color beautiful. It is nice and warm and very comfy. It is quite lovely to look at and touch. For that, plus the cheap price, I'll give it barely 4 stars. For the undersize and launder problem, i should give it no more than 3 stars.",138,5

I can't say I'm unhappy with the purchase, the other reviews were real clear, I went in eyes wide open.  It's a decent value and it serves it's purpose nicely, but it's not a comforter you're likely to fall in love with when you pick it up.  (Those cost way more.)",115,17

The first thing you notice with this product is the sound. It ""crinkles"" and sounds cheap. The sound is akin to cellophane and not at all pleasant. Then you notice the big fault: it won't stay stuffed. From the time we first received it to now this comforter must have lost 50% of the feathers. They are everywhere. It makes the product look dirty when it sits on the bed and it pokes and prods all night when in use.

Horrible product. I have no choice but to keep using it and cleaning up a few feathers here and there each morning until enough of them poke out to where it will stop...at least that is my hope, if not I will have to shell out real money to buy a quality comforter from sears or macy's and chuck this one in the trash where it belongs.",156,32

The feathers inside are poking through the material on both sides which not only makes it uncomfortable to sleep with due to the quills coming through but makes a mess because of all the feathers on my floor.

The cost to have this cleaned professionally was the same as buying a new one so I did what I could to clean it myself. Since the blanket was too big to really get clean in the washer and micro suede will melt/burn in the dryer; I washed this in the bath tub and hung it to dry. It was so hard to ring most of the water out and so heavy to move to hang. The other thing I didn't like was the feathers came out of the blanket so constantly that it was never without a lint covered look and there were always feathers everywhere to clean up. You live and learn. I now have a different blanket that is not filled with feathers.",141,57

I would suggest this blanket for a guest room that's for show and doesn't get much use.",76,58

I felt like I was on the set of a horror movie, REVENGE OF THE CHICKEN FEATHERS! It felt like a million needles were sticking me, and it was impossible to clean up. I had to move to a new apartment, and recommend my old apartment to bird lovers only. There is no way that bedroom will ever be feather-free again, there are just too many feathers everywhere. My maid, Rosario, cursed and ran out of the apartment when she saw what had happened. This comforter will ruin your life.",113,60

I'm not just saying a couple here and there I'm saying this thing is a feather factory which puts out a handful of feathers daily. If your goal is to make your bedroom look like a chicken coop then you will succeed if you purchase this blanket set. If you trim pine branches outside and go to bed without getting all the sap off you will wake up looking like a bird man!

Once it's washed, it's done for. I used to pay my sister to ""de-feather"" when it comes out the drier because there are feathers poking out everywhere. You don't want a comforter with feathers. You want a down comforter to avoid this.

I bought this about 9 months ago for $35 when it was on sale. At first I was really impressed with the comforter.  The cover of the comforter (microsuede side)felt wonderful and it kept me plenty warm.  After a bit of use and washings I noticed more and more feathers escaping right through the fabric side (no holes just right through the fabric).  Also my comforter only has X's and doesn't have the full sewn boxes like more expensive models to keep the down in place so the down and feathers end up in the edges of the comforter while you lay under the middle. I would recommend you save your money and buy a better comforter.  Personally I'm tired of having to pluck myself each morning so into the trash this one will go.",144,143
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I bought this comforter last spring.  I was looking for an inexpensive comforter and found this one.  The microfiber top is nice and soft.  It is rather light, but is good for the warmer months.  It washes up nicely.  My only complaint is that it sheds feathers.  The blanket I have under it usually has feathers all over it.  I only  paid 35.00 for the king size, it is hard to find any king size comforter for that price.

I haven't had any problems with the feathers moving toward the center or poking out, and my husband is a big guy also. The only bad thing about it is that it is not that big.

It's comfortable, soft, very light and breathes better than you would think.  I have it on top of one of my very fluffy down comforters and another micro suede comforter, a little fluffier than this one, so this is almost like the cover of the bed.

The color is what I consider a true brick color: deep red.  The color was exactly what I wanted, so the shams are very useful.  The comforter itself, not so much.  I have it folded across the foot of my bed for color rather than function.",88,164
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"It's not as ""thick"" as I prefer my comforters to be and it is 'noisy'.  Meaning, whenever you turn you can hear the cover rustling around.  Not good for very light sleepers.",32,165

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,2.0,negative,"It is very pretty, but needs more bulk.  Also we see quite a few feathers come out from the comforter.  But the price was cheap.  You get what you pay for.  It's okay for spring or early fall, but don't expect heavy duty warmth from it.",46,167
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"I have a Ralph Lauren down comforter that I've had for a while but needed something a little lighter for the summer - this comforter was perfect. As a precaution, it is pretty thin. This is not a winter comforter, but it does keep you warm. The materials are semi high-quality. You get what you pay for.

My only problem with the comforter is that the feathers tend to come out through the material on occasion but that is expected with a down comforter for the most part.

Overall, I was happy with the gold box price I paid for this set and would reccommend it as a good comforter under $100",112,168
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,There are two reasons I didn't give this product 5/5...it sheds feathers like CRAZY and is dry clean only.  Otherwise a nice comfortable lightweight feather comforter.,26,169

Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,1.0,negative,"When I first unpacked it, I thought it looked like a very nice comforter, especially considering what I paid for it. I  soon realized that looks aren't everything. A day hasn't gone by where I haven't had to dispose 8 or more feathers. At this rate, it is going to be nothing more than an empty shell. Even at $35, I feel I paid too much for this. I would avoid buying this unless you are needing some feathers for a Donald Duck costume you are working on, but this would even fail at that as there are about half a dozen different kinds/colors of feathers inside thing. Only 15% of its' content is actual down.",116,171
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,4.0,positive,"This is not a fluffy down comforter, it more like a down bedspread.  I purchased the king for a queen size as I want that look.  It does have a nice feel to it however, you do get a few feathers which are noticable on the black colored microsuede.  I love the feel of the microsuede and will also get some sheets in it.  People have commented that it does look very nice I paired it will so high quality white sheets and some black satin pillow shams, yet to use the pillows sham that came with it as I did get King size pillow shams with my set.",109,172
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"I purchased this on a Friday special sale price and received it for only 29.99!! It is very lightweight and comfortable, and the pillow shams were king size, not standard as in the other reviews. I have a queen size bed and ordered the king size, glad I did, because it just covers the top nicely and has very little on the sides. I am diabetic with neuropathy in both legs and feet, this lightweight comforter is replacing another that was too heavy on my feet at night. I reside in Florida where you don't need a heavy comforter, but because I also have the microsuede throw that I ordered last winter, I can attest to the fact that they are also very warm and comfortable, while remaining lightweight! There was no bedskirt included in my package, which was also fine with me, because my bed is adjustable, the bedskirts don't work well anyway. Definitely a 5 star product for the money, the microsuede is very soft also.",168,173

It's definately black and when I first opened it, it didn't look like it would be too thick, but it just needed time to air out. It seems thin, but it is extremely warm and the under part is almost like a vinyl, so it keeps you cool also. Overall, very satisfied. I recommend this.",77,175
Home_and_Kitchen,B000LPJ3HK,5.0,positive,"This was in the Gold Box, and the customer reviews were very positive so I bought the queen/full set for my guest bedroom.  I'm very pleased!  It's light weight, looks nice, it's warm, etc.  I found the range of color choices kind of icky, but the ""Camel"" is sufficiently bland to blend with any decor.  Additionally, it should withstand getting dirty easily.  It weighs nothing, and it does not smell at all!  Apparently people have had odiferous adventures by machine washing it??

I was thinking I was getting a sheet, comforter, and pillow cases because of the ""set"" but this set does not include the sheet.  I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks and it works well.  I tend to get a little hot with this comforter but my girl friend loves it!  It's really comfortable, soft, and has no weird odor coming from it.  Additionally, you can machine wash this comforter but it is recommended that you dry clean it.  One really annoying thing about this comforter is how the down stuffing all ends up at the bottom or sides of the comforter.  You contently have to shake the comforter to get a nice distribution of the stuffing throughout. The reason this happens is because the squares/pattern on the comforter doesn't completely enclose the down stuffing.

The lids are a nice touch because they stay shut after trash items have been dropped inside.  I realize that the lids are a bit costly (about the same price of the trash can itself), but I think we need it in our office environment because they look much better than just having an open trash can.  I have it four stars because of the price is higher than I would have preferred ($31.84).",130,2
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,1.0,negative,"I ordered a replacement lid 14 1/2 X 14 1/2.  I received the ""Slim Jim"" instead.  The company took no responsibility for sending the wrong item and I had to pay return shipping.  Very unsatisfied. I will never deal with this site again.",43,3
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,4.0,positive,"Not worth the full street price, IMO, but I'd still keep mine.

The plastic is surprisingly thin and light, and mine did come with the jagged flashing as another reviewer photographed. The rods were shipped loose, as was expected and as I suspect they are supposed to be shipped.

Installation tip: DO NOT attempt to take the doors out of the frame to install the rods. Instead, push the rods between the door and the frame, then loop around from behind to pop the rods into the doors. Another reviewer's trick of using a sturdy hook or S-shaped tool works great. I just used my fingers.

As for the doors catching on the plastic liner, that is solved by buying the correct sized liner such that it is stretched taut over the mouth of the trash can. Buying too large a liner inevitably results in ballooning or bunching of the bag, which invites the door catches getting caught on the excess plastic.",162,4

As mentioned in some other reviews, the swinging lid sometimes gets caught on the plastic can liner.",88,15
Industrial_and_Scientific,B005KD3AJU,2.0,negative,"This lid will not stay closed. Once I put trash into the garbage can, the lid swings open and then hangs there. I have to manually grab the flap so it will swing closed, or I have to try and jostle the can a bit so the lid will swing closed.

Those metal bars when not in their track properly, which is impossible to do, fall out.  Some of the lids came with the metal bars in their track properly.  Most of the lids did not and the metal bars fall out constantly.  I own a childcare center and purchased these for the classrooms to use for food disposal.  But the doors are suppose to close.

My son loved the ball and does use it, and I love that you can clip it onto things, however I am only rating it 4 stars becuase my hope was that I could clip it to his belt loop so he woudn't lose it at school, but it's too heavy and too big (think sized for adult hands).

It is much too large for his hand.  The plastic feels oily.  I don't know how to describe it other than that.  I was hoping he would be able to ""squish"" it.  He has lost it already.

With this style of flute you are essentially making your mouth be the mouthpiece.  The technique is not unlike getting a tone when blowing into a jug or glass soda bottle.  Your mouth needs to change shape some for each note as well.

I like this flute and take it with me when I'm out and about. By itself, or in drum and  hand instrument circles it sounds quite nice. I got applause from the other musicians last time I had a little solo with it. This flute can be surprisingly expressive.

The tuning on this for the low C is good, but the minor pentatonic seems a little off as you work your way up the scale (and is exacerbated in the higher registers), so I think some of the Pythagorean intervals could use some work (or maybe it's just my western ear).

Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,2.0,negative,"Pros: It's the most portable and the least expensive USB MIDI keyboard out there.

Cons: It is very difficult to use for recording music. The ""keys"" are built like a laptop keyboard. It's difficult for entering chords, playing melodies. The keys don't provide the proper feel when playing. They squish when you press them. It's hard to explain.

Its Ok for entering in melodies one note at a time. I can see how this could be very useful for the traveling composer because it is extremely thin, but that portability comes at a price: usability. I should have bought the Akai LPK25 instead.

Normally, I love Korg products. They make some of the most amazing, innovative stuff (Like the KAOS series)it's just that this product does not provide the tactile feedback of a real keyboard and it is too difficult to enter chords for me.

Verdict: This keyboard is extremely portable, so it's a good 2nd keyboard for the traveling composer, but I would not recommend using it as a primary keyboard in a home studio, as it only provides very limited utility.",183,9

Enter the Nano Key. It does everything I need for entering MIDI data into the DAW, it's velocity sensitive, meaning the harder you hit the key the louder the note sounds.

Only drawbacks are expected ones because its such an entry level device. The keys have no pivot point and feel like computer keys rather than piano keys. The keyboard itself is scaled down significantly so playing chords can get quite squashed. Also the pitch bend tool is a button not a wheel so you have no control over the speed of the bend or the inflection amount.

For a basic cheap MIDI controller it is fantastic and does the job very well. I use it primarily for input into Finale 2010 via the speedy entry tool and it works perfectly. Takes up very little real estate on my desk which is a bonus!",133,12

Never played the keyboard before and purchased this one to create simple chord progressions (one octave only).
Very limited space between keys and very bad sensitivity: unables you to make nuances or to make accents decently.
Very good to ""on the go"" music because of its size, but not rugged enough. Keys started to fall apart around two months after purchase.

SOFTWARE
Very good software included and easy to install too.
Tested it in CUBASE 3,4,5 REAPER and various VSTs : the key mapping is almost perfect in every case.

Musical_Instruments,B001J8INY2,1.0,negative,"I've gone through three of these in the last two years. I guess I don't learn too easily.

The first one broke because the USB connection cracked. I opened it up to see if it could be repaired, and realized the only thing that had been holding the connector to the circuit board was a tiny blob of solder. The second one lost several of its keys because I had it in a padded laptop bag. The slightest amount of pressure will cause the keys to fly off like springs, and they're designed in such a way that they can never be put back on correctly.

I'm now on my third nanokey. a few keys have popped off this one as well. I've glued them back on with silicon, but this affects the action. But even in new condition, the key action on this device is no more playable than a computer keypad. How such a product ever got past the R&D stage is incredible.

You know how when you depress the edges of black keys that you slide in depressing the far inside part of the white key? Well, there is no far inside part of the white key; it doesn't exist, which makes chord entry very slow. Four-note chord with any black keys? Forget it.

It is OK if you take care of it, but useless when you have to throw it away.

Akai came out with the LPK25, which is the same concept, but looks more like a real keyboard.  It is about the same width and depth as the Nanokey, but is over twice as thick which may or may not be a factor for you.  The LPK25 adds an arpeggiator, but drops the pitch-bend buttons.

The worst part of it is that after about 3 or so hours of using it, the handle slipped right off of the metal wrench part. Seems like very cheap glue was used to secure the two pieces.

I tried it again, recently, and was disappointed to find that the formulation is exactly the same as it used to be. Firstly, the lead is very light in color. You can barely see it, when writing on white paper. It's really more of a light pink, than a red, as well. Secondly, the lead is very brittle. It breaks constantly, even when writing with a light touch. I can barely write a few lines, without a breakage. Given this fact, I don't think this lead is useful for anything more than making check marks on papers. I certainly cannot do any serious writing with it. Lastly, it feels very strange to write with it. Granted it is not a graphite lead, the feel is still unusual, like trying to write with something made of wax.

Lots of cool features like the little antenna lights up in colors when it rings and several different ring tones.  You can even assign different colors and rings to different callers.  One thing I don't like too much is that there is not a typical sounding ring tone to choose from.  There are no problems with signal strength or range of the phone.  I have one handset upstairs and another in the basement and haven't had a problem with either one.  The phone is pretty easy to program, but I did have to read the instruction booklet.",143,13
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,"Super!!! If you have any type of interference from your computer dial up conection this is the phone to have!

Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,4.0,positive,"This cordless phone has the best reception of any cordless telephone we have previously owned so far.  We like the feature of conference calling between three handsets.  The paging option for the handsets is another great feature, to page another handset during a call to include another person in the conversation or to contact another person near one of the other handsets instead of yelling down the stairs.  The flashing lighted ring around the top of the antenna makes it convenient to locate the handset in the dark when you are receiving a call.",94,16
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,"You can't go wrong with this phone.  I've always been a fan of Panasonic phones.  I've still got 3 old Panasonic cordless phones that just won't die.

Pros:

Feels solid and comfortable in your hands

Sound quality is good - even at a good distance from the home base

Speaker phone is clear and callers can hear me well

Blinking light on antenna for voice messages

Black & grey color is attractive and looks good almost anywhere in house

Cons:

I wish the keypad had a backlight

When you scroll through calls, the name and number are not on the same screen",102,17
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,lots of good features.unfortunatly the most important feature of a phone is clarity and this phone system does not deliver. Hard to hear your conversations.,25,18
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,After having tried two other systems I found this one really worked well.  The handsets are very functional and the sound quality is excellent.  The speakerphone capability has proved handy.  I didn't think I would use the intercom feature much but it turns out to be very handy given it comes with three handets we put all throughout the house.,60,19
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,Where to begin... Very difficult to hear - even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear.  Missed call feature does not account for calls received on any of the other handsets.  Programming is not as easy as many other brands.  Those are just a few of my concerns.  I'll pick a Uniden model next time!,57,20
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,"I have had these phones for a week now and at first they worked great and one week later you can hardly hear the person on the other end.  This is my second set, I returned the first set for the same problem n hopes that it was just bad phones, but the second set is just as horrible... Dont waist your money..",63,21
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,"Overall, I really like this phone - great features, etc. However, like some of the other reviewers who've posted here, my phone began buzzing almost immediately- so badly that I couldn't hear the person on the other end (they could hear me fine). Since I have digital phone service connected to my DSL modem, I followed the owner's manual tip and bought a noise filter. This worked fine for about a week, then the buzzing returned. I bought another filter, thinking the first one had crapped out, but the buzzing persisted. I even had a technician from the cable company come out to check their equipment, which was in perfect working order. I was assured by the cable company that their system would support this phone. SO..... after much frustration, I'm returning this to Amazon today (luckily, it hasn't been 30 days since delivery yet).  BEWARE WHEN CONSIDERING BUYING THIS UNIT!!!",151,22
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,5.0,positive,"I bought these phones on the recommedation of a family member, and I couldn't be more thrilled.  These are the best phones that we have ever used.  The sound quality is unbelievable and they had all the features we were looking for.

Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,2.0,negative,"1. There was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when I tried multiple jacks for the base.

2. Phone features worked as advertised. but the Voice Enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse.

3. It was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset.

I returned it mainly because of the buzzing.",62,25
Office_Products,B000F49ZHU,1.0,negative,"At first I thought this phone had everything - and it is loaded with features, and has a good range.  However, after using it for about 5 weeks, I now have a very, very loud buzzing noise on all the handsets - it appears to come from the base and it is so loud I can barely hear the caller.  I have tested this base on other jacks (still same problem) and I have tested other cordless phones from the existing jack, and they work fine with no buzz.  I'm convinced it is in the base unit of the Panasonic phone.  But after multiple email customer service attempts at Panazonic, I have not yet heard anything from this company.  I'm scrapping the phone and buying a much cheaper, but more highly rated AT&T.",133,26

Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,4.0,positive,"I've had the pad for roughly 18 months and it is still quite functional.  I haven't had any major problems as I gently use for my keyboard and mouse (no mouse pad needed).  I really like the size on how easy it is to keep clean (a simple wipe does the trick).  Another thing I like about it is that it - at least in my case - is resilient to scratches, scuffs and dents.  However, the glue and stitching it poor is some areas - especially, when the humidity is high.  That being said, it serves it's purpose very nicely.",101,5
Office_Products,B001PMC8T8,1.0,negative,"Cheaply built, filled with cardboard, and split at the seams right away.  Glued it back together and serves the purpose, but way over priced.",24,6

Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1.0,negative,"First, at the 11 x 17 size, this is item is floppy and flaccid and won't work for the purpose of supporting your papers while writing on them. It will only work to clip papers together and hold them in place. Very disappointing.

Office_Products,B001PME1DO,2.0,negative,"Served its purpose well for about 3 months until it slid off the desk and the whole corner chipped, rendering it almost unusable.  I would concur with other reviews that this product needs to be a little heftier for good, durable field use (come on, it's recycled plastic; it's not like the raw material is too expensive).  Given its short life and cost, this item is too expensive for what you get.",72,6
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,1.0,negative,I thought I was getting an 11x17 clip board. not a 11 3/4x12 7/8.....useless I did not think there would be fine print to read on this product as well.,30,7
Office_Products,B001PME1DO,5.0,positive,"Works great, plastic is bendy when compared to a regular clipboard/hardboard material so if you need a ""rock-hard"" platform to do your work, look elsewhere.

I am not sure why everyone says they go through batteries, I have had my pot 1 year and just replaced the batteries for the first time. I turn it in almost every evening through the summer/fall while out on my porch. I added clear aquarium glass rocks to the bottom of my pot to give the base weight in the breeze and it has never tipped nor does it interfere with the color, actually it gives some pretty dynamics to the colors. I love this pot and would definitely recommend it for some fun lighting.",99,1

She loves gardening, etc., and I had to install batteries before giving the gift, so I got to see how it worked.  Really great!  You may want to consider putting a small already-potted plant within this pot, but the color changes were so beautiful, would make a nice addition to anyone's garden area, or to be used inside.  Haven't heard any complaints from who I gave it to, and that was in July, it's November now, so I think it's safe to say everything is working just fine.",107,2

It is not unusual to see thermometers hanging around people's homes and it looks just like any other thermometer. It easily fits two keys (I only put one in there) and it snaps right together.

It's even saved my husband and I a time or two! Easy to screw in (nails or screws not included) and hides two keys safely inside.

If I park and leave her in the car (in appropriate weather), she will get to the front seat by squeezing between the doorpost and the front drivers seat. No problem.

When the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down.  They like to take turns leaning on the center console and  would slide forward when stopping.  She sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the Giant and he tries to escape to the front.  Not good, nor safe.

The metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof, they would hit the glass of sunroof.  Those  seem to be semi-permanent.  Whether that is because take up to much room to store, or to hard to install and remove I do not know.  All don't buy decision makers for me.

When I discovered Kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs, IT DOES!

Easy to install and remove, even folds and slides back into storage bag easily.

Dogs were happy they could still look over headrests and we're all riding safer.

We're happy and have already recommended to someone in the parking lot!",162,59

He is a major shedder and likes to leave imprints on the car windows with his nose. This device was difficult to attach. It took a number of tries to find a way to fasten the lower parts. Biggest problem, however, was the ease with which our dog found ways to go through the barrier when we left him in the car. It worked well to prevent him from climbing onto the center console while we were driving.",104,61

Pet_Supplies,B000F71DF4,4.0,positive,"The Kurgo Backseat Pet Barrier is remarkably effective at keeping my 40-pound, very enthusiastic Portuguese Water Dog out of the front seat.  This was critical to me, because my car, a Saab, has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats, and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as I was driving--a rather unnerving experience.

As soon as she saw the barrier, my dog didn't even try to wiggle through.  It sent a clear message, and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet.

The barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat, while simultaneously barring access to the front seat.  One caveat--the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror, so I'm planning to remove it. (It unfastens easily.) This product is a great value and will probably last a very long time, owing to its sturdy construction and strong materials.  I've owned it for about a month, and couldn't be happier.",182,65

my only complaint is the installation.  it was a pain and difficult to understand and i'm not sure if it's installed correctly.  instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat.  other then that, it's not as tall as i had expected/hoped.  my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive, but at least he's contained to the back seat.",145,67

I wrapped the sisal rope around the entire cat tree and secured the rope with a hot glue gun here and there.  Then I sprayed the rope with a very strong catnip spray and now my cat loves it.  Cats are naturally attracted to sisal rope, and I hated of the idea of wasting my money since the cat wasn't using it prior to adding rope.  Another bad thing is that this scratching post is very lightweight.  If you use it in the upright position, when the cat scratches it will fall right over.  So I only use mine in the laying down position.  So unless plan on modifying this, don't waste your money.",139,0

They wrestle with it & scratch their chins on the edges of the bottom piece.  They love it & laying flat there is no problem with them scratching the heck out of it.  So it may not appear to be as sturdy as a wooden stand up post, but if you are creative (actually the cats tipped it the way they wanted it) & just tip it on its side, it works great.  I would buy another. The carpet is a very tight knit indoor-outdoor type carpet & does not fray like the stand up rug posts.

Pet_Supplies,B000OSDK64,5.0,positive,This post is great for cats who like to scratch the carpet or furniture with the heavy upholstered weave. It's not for all. I have sisal rope post that cost 75$. The best quality made and my cat barely touches it. He loves this one. It is not heavy and is best wedged between something or under something so it gives them a sturdy hold when they scratch. I love the raised curved edge as I prop it beneath a chair and it's the perfect length so it fits secure and my cat can stand lengthwise if he pleases on all 4's to scratch.

That is, it became a webservice instead of a standalone application, but they forgot to notify vendors about this, who still sell it as the latter. And this makes it a plane rip off.

TuneUp is amazing for making your music library more presentable, which is great for iOS devices, because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better.

Software,B01COADLXG,1.0,negative,"Not user friendly, didn't even work at first because of something with the graphics card and needing to download a different version. By the time I got it working our project was almost over and the software was so difficult to use. I want my money back.",47,2
Software,B01COADLXG,5.0,positive,I like it. It has a learning curve but works well. I am trying to figure out how to make the roof go over the porch but I think it is because I added the porch after I built the house. Still working on it.,45,3

I ended up upgrading to the next higher version though, as I didn't realize until afterwards that you are unable to do sloped terrains (for walk out basements and such) with the essentials version.

I had tried several other house design software programs both online and over the counter and was very disappointed with them, This is the only one I could use without any difficulty at all. I was great to be able to give my builder an exact drawing and layout of what I wanted without having to use an architect or sketching something up on paper. Then, when he was done it looked exactly like it did on the computer, inside and out! It was almost anti-climactic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you will probably find out that the ""standard"" program is a little lacking and you will need to upgrade (for extra $$ of course) to a better version, still it's well worth the money and a ton cheaper then hiring someone.",151,16

When I was his age, thanks to my grandfather being retired military, I was given my first pair of boots similar to these because I too was very hard on shoes.  Having this experience already I figured to do the same for my son.

He has worn them for a eleven months now, which for him is amazing.  The leather is still in good condition, the nylon has held and there isn't a single stitch that has been worn out by constant use.  However, I'm a bit disappointed with the soles because they have worn quickly when compared with other brands.  I myself have been wearing the same pair of Wellco Jungle boots for 3 years every day and the soles of mine, though worn do not look anything like his.  His literally have gouges missing on the heel and the toe is almost worn smooth.  Still for an active child whose hard on shoes, when considering the price I've got to give 5 stars.",185,5

The other reviews are correct you should order them one size smaller than you normally wear. I did not and am having to return them. When I contacted the seller they replied promptly and with courtesy. I will be buying other merchandise from this seller in the future. The boots did look like they would need insoles.

They are comfy.  With a bit of break in, they get very soft, and really don't offer much protection against rough and tumble environments, but.... they are a pleasure to walk in, fairly light, give fairly good wear (ie, they last ok).

I've had boots that were top shelf, costing several times the price of the Rothco boots.  They lasted longer.  They were a bit tougher.  No lighter as I recall.  I can't say the top of the line boots were as good a value.

I'm rather rough on my footwear, doing outdoor/jobsite work most of the time.  I can use these, not worry about my ""expensive"" boots, and they pretty much take the abuse until the soles wear thin.

Five of them had been completely snapped at the neck where the cup meets the stem.  If I needed more than 5 of them, I would return them for refund or replacement.

Of the 7 that did make it in one piece, they are what you would expect for being so inexpensive.  Plastic throughout, with some inconsistencies in the manufacturing process so there are little blemishes here and there.  And the necks do seem solid for something so small/cheap, so it's kind of surprising that 5 of them came broken.  My recommendation is that if you need 12 of them, order 2 dozen or find a different option.",142,14

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,2.0,negative,"I love the design of this lighter. It's built solid enough to use as a weapon, holds lots of butane and points an LED light at whatever you're trying to light at night - perfect for campfires. The dual flame type for wind resistance also burns the fuel more efficiently so it doesn't leave black smudges on glass or metal surfaces. It would be a great lighter IF it worked!! #1 worked for about a week before the LED light quit working, the switch stopped ""clicking"". I didn't send it back for repair, instead I cut back the rubber to jam the safety button to make it light easier, then ordered a new one. #2 arrived empty and 4 attempts to fill it failed with a hissing sound at the refill valve. This one I sent back to Zippo for warranty repair. #3 arrived today - they sent me a brand new one - but the LED switch doesn't click at all so the light doesn't work.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,4.0,positive,"Got one for Christmas.. works well, though it does require a little effort to hit the 2 buttons in sequence to get it lit.  I got it down but my wife hates that part, which probably makes it child and accident-proof.

The instructions mention that this is a windproof lighter.. at least if you keep blowing it out it will relight.  That doesn't mean it will stay lit in high winds, but it will relight when the wind dies down as long as you are still holding the buttons.

The windproof-effect has something to do with 2 flame outlets.. the main orifice has a small glowing grille, next to it is a tiny hole where another flame comes out.  The flame itself is not a jet but like that of a candle.

The built-in LED light works OK and the button for that is easy to operate.  The black rubber handle only seems to add bulk, but it won't slip out of your hands.  The carabiner clip is probably useful.

I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the double-button push required to light.",185,1

The reason I'm bestowing Five Stars on this tool is the combination of quality and price.  I'm biased toward Zippos anyway, because they're simple and they work 99.9% of the time.  Most things in life work 75% of the time, and not always that.

For what I paid in plastic refillables with triggers in the winter of 1999, I could have bought two of these.  So I'm going to buy another now, and another one yet for a gift.

Comes with a nice key ring for hanging it up.  The drawbacks are 1.  The fuel level window is so small, and doesn't go through to the other side of the lighter so I can't see the level, and 2.  You have to push two buttons at once (child proofing) to turn on the flame.  They are quit stiff because they are covered with a rubber shield and hard to depress together.

They way over do it with the safety feature its so good that nobody can get it working. Wish they would just do away with the safety button.

Sports_and_Outdoors,B000WN4Z3I,1.0,negative,"I was very excited to get this product because I am tired of the cheap $5 lighters that you get from the supermarket. However, when I got this I was horrified by the performance. The first thing I noticed when I tried to light it is that the flame is pitiful. It barely comes out the end (yes I adjusted the knob at the bottom all the way up). The flame is also very easy to blow out. I was trying to show my kids that it would relight, so I let them blow on it, but it would go out with even the smallest puff (from my 2 year old) and it would never come back.

The LED light also takes stupid watch batteries so beware of that.

I topped it off with butane, set the flame adjust to maximum, and double checked that the batteries were installed properly.  Still nothing.  After many more frustrated attempts to engage the very difficult to use safety and ignition buttons at the same time, it finally produced a flame about an 1/8th of an inch high.  Wind resistant?  A baby could blow out this flame.  By the way, it is not actually manufactured by Zippo in Bradford Pennsylvania.  According to the package, this item is ""manufactured in China to Zippo Quality standards.""  Zippo should be ashamed of itself.  This is an expensive piece of junk with their name on it.",142,19

Out of the box, I thought I had a defective product. The batteries that the product came with were dead. When I put my own batteries in, I had to spend a while switching them around and rotating the bulb assembly, when it finally lit up. So if you think your light doesn't work, just fiddle with it for a little while longer.

So, with brand new high output batteries, this light is barely brighter than a 7w bulb in my oven.

I do not feel safe using this as a signal light on my back for riding my bike on the road at night. I would not recommend people use this for that purpose at all, at this price point their are other options.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,1.0,negative,"This was quite a disappointment. My first order arrived with the stone broken in three pieces. This wasn't a big deal as Amazon was awesome and replaced it with no trouble. When I received the replacement and started trying to use it, however, it's kind of a piece of garbage. The stone has inconsistencies that cause audible clicks while sharpening, and has a visible bow to it from the factory, causing grinds to be slightly convex on the rough side and concave on the fine side, which increases the work of sharpening by a lot and reduces control of the angles. There is also a raised burr on one end of the stone on the fine side which you run the risk of slamming your freshly honed blade into if you're not attentive and careful. The honing guide has a flat spot on one of its wheels, causing the blade to wobble while grinding. In the end I'm going to have to replace everything here with better products except for the oil, which I've already mostly used on the stone. I'd recommend you skip this and go for something better, this one doesn't even do the job as a cheaper entry level sharpening stone.",204,35

I just started restoring an old plane and though this would be an easy way to get started. The honing guide is very inaccurate as the plastic piece that helps determine the angle is quite loose and not precise.  You could hone two different times and start honing a different angle from the initial time.  The stone also go clogged easily and soaked up quite a bit of the oil on the first use.  It's also a bit too narrow for a plane.  It will work, but a larger surface would be much easier.  Spend a little bit more money and don't waste your time on this product.  It might be good for other projects like small knife sharpening, but the honing guide is a paperweight now.",151,36

Tools_and_Home_Improvement,B000KFTDSK,4.0,positive,"This has worked well for me for it's intended purpose. It's not the best quality, but it is good. As a carpenter, I've used it to keep my chisels and plane blades sharp for the last 4 years. Using the guide seems like a hassle in the middle of a job, it can be a little tedious to square, but it really does give you a better cutting edge when you can keep the blade angle perfectly straight. The only improvement I'd like to see on this is a guide to help square what ever blade you're putting in it. If you aren't sharping blades all the time you really don't need the guide but what I paid for this was about the same as the price of a decent stone and small bottle of oil anyways so I basically got the guide for free.

The gauge I don't use as it seems clunky and just seems easier to do by hand. The oil soaks straight into the stone so it provides very little lubrication. I ended up getting wet/dry sandpaper of varying grits and wrapping it around the stone to sharpen my chisels. The surface is flat which is the only thing I really like about it.

I notice this even though I try to make it really tight. I didn't notice this as much with my hand plane blades. I do like the built in angle measuring function. It's really handy and makes changing your angle easy. That is kind of put to the side though if things shift too easily. There are markings that are supposed to help you keep things straight but they aren't incremental enough for the common chisels that I put in (1/4, 1/2, 3/4 & 1-1/2). I am admittedly new at this with a honing jig so perhaps I just need more practice. I spent a couple of afternoons cleaning up some old blades and there is a large improvement in sharpness. I do wish there was a way to ensure that the blade is hitting the stone more flat so that it does not create an angled bevel.",172,61

As we use then we hold a chisel vertical and either drag it towards or away from ones self.  Good boat guys learn to push it away but I lack the acquired strength and drag it towards.

Blades and chisels are also not held firmly, resulting in rounded corners.  Finally, the stone itself is adequate for rough sharpening only and blades will require finishing on a much finer stone to be usuable.

The combination stone's grits feels to me to be in the neighborhood of a 250/600, but I'm just guessing since there was no nomenclature defining grits provided in the kit. The white oil leaking slightly on-arrival, and worked fine for it's part in the sharpening process. There is probably enough to recover three to five significantly damaged 1"" chisels.  But, I didn't buy this kit for the stone or oil, I bought it for the guide, which for me, was a waste of my time and money, especially since I built a simple jig similar to the one in KWB's posted pictures.

I've read articles and watched videos on sharpening plane blades. I tried to use this guide but as stated in many other reviews it is virtually impossible to get the blade square in the guide. Then once I got the blade into the guide it was a huge pain in the a** to get it out of the guide. The cheap plastic pieces that the adjustment screws go into are horrible. The rollers are cheap plastic as well.

I wish it had been made a touch more precise for setup and adjustment to keep the blade set just right, centered, and perfectly aligned..... but with a little extra care, this does an excellent job.
