All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"These are very thin, pull off easily without residue (rare!). The only odd thing about these is that on the crease, it actually had cut out slits along it, so technically a person could sweat through those slit openings on the crease of their jacket/shirts.",45,0
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"sweat went right thought within almost 2 hrs of wearing it, not the best",14,1
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,So far they haven't really worked - won't stick to the fabric of my jacket.,15,2
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"I have tried several brands of shields, and most don't stay attached all day/evening. This purchase resulted in a great product that stayed put for as long as needed.  Love them and am hoping that I receive an equally excellent product when I need to reorder!",46,3
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"They do not stick well to the fabric. Bunch up, not comfortable.",12,4
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,It did not stick to the material of my shirts,10,5
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,My wife thinks that these things are great.,8,6
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,The item does not adhere  to clothing very well. It's basically pointless to use this product. Very disappointing indeed.,19,7
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,These shields were too flimsy. Did not sick and bunched up. Will not purchase again.,15,8
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,The shields are made to be more flexible so stayed on all day on my jacket - I had a sleeveless top under so they protected my jacket well.  just be mindful when you take the jacket off/put it on.  I will continue to use these - much improved from older versions that would come off.,56,9
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,Perfect for the Victorian Era Ball.  Now I don't have to wash the whole dress after every event.,18,10
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,Very hard to position. Not worth the hassle.,8,11
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"The idea seems great but once I started sweating the sticker peeled off and started getting stuck to other places so they were no longer absorbing my armpit or any sweat.

It's kind of a give and take, on the plus side the adhesive leaves no residue but on the negative side its not strong enough to stay put with heavy sweating.

Maybe a non-heavy sweater would have better luck.",70,12
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,Great product!  I used these for a series of interviews that I wouldn't have time to have my suit cleaned between every interview.  They worked perfect to keep odors off of the jackets i used.,35,13
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"I bought 3 brands of dress-shield and I tried these last. These were thinner (like the 2nd brand) and I understand the manufacturer not wanting a bulky shield but when they are this thin, they are useless!!!!!!!!! People who buy these, sweat and as such a paper thin shield is a waste of time, money and  embarrassment. If you perspire, avoid these. If you just want to avoid deodorant marks on your clothes, good enough!",75,14
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,"Helped prevent stains, but did tend to slip a little.",10,15
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,"I can see how these may not be the best for a shirt. However, they've saved me $$$ on dry-cleaning for my work blazers. A nice blazer or jacket is expensive and it's awesome to get a few wears out of each during EITHER a big client meeting or a hot spring/summer day. These will be stocking stuffers over the holidays for sure.",63,16
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"These are good in theory, but they don't stick to my clothing.",12,17
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,"barely sticks to clothing, ends up bunched and then unattached",10,18
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"The adhesive doesn't seem strong enough. Several pads either ended up migrating to another part of my shirt or just fell of altogether when I applied them to silkier fabrics. On the plus side, these pads are quite thin and quiet.",41,19
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,It's not sticky and the material is poor.,8,20
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,They did the job but part of the pads were sticking to my skin which bothered me at first then it was okay.,23,21
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,4.0,positive,I've only used this once. It worked fine.,8,22
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,1.0,negative,I would not recommend this product. very bad quality for the price I paid.,14,23
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"Great idea, but held up poorly. Kept peeling off and sticking to my skin. No bueno.",16,24
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,2.0,negative,"Great concept, in theory...but I find they don't fit well in blazers (as I'd intended to use them).",18,25
All_Beauty,B005U5KU46,5.0,positive,"These are perfect to protect your clothing from sweat and staining and odor. I use these in blazers mostly. They're perfect! I will say that if you're sleeves are tight, this shield will be difficult to apply/stay in place when you put the blazer on. They are the perfect size for the underarm and you can't tell they're there. These are must-haves for long work days.",66,26
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,I was very impressed. I plan on ordering from them for all my tattoo supplies.,15,0
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,I really like my gun. Run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,15,1

All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,1.0,negative,The power supply went out on me and never worked again.,11,3
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also,12,4
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,Its doing good so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos . I love this item,23,5
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,machine is fine but the ink sucks had no problem other than the ink sucks terribly just doesnt mix well with skin I guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe,34,6
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink,21,7
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,"It is a good starter kit, but over heats with bigger tattoos, power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems, very nice people, i would recomend this kit",34,8
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,i recieved my machine today it arived on time and had everything in it it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up,49,9
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,The machine came within 4 days of me buying it. But the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily. A warning to first time tattooer's this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own. Also please for my own sake don't use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit) but i've never heard of the brand and something tells me it's bad ink. Other wise it's a perfect machine for beginners.,102,10
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,The kit came 1 day late but its cool . Lol the grip is not the one they show it's straight. N ink caps white no biggie . Thanks  you.,30,11
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,2.0,negative,It didn't come with a grip! I waited forever and I searched everywhere and there was no grip,18,12
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,5.0,positive,"I LIKE DRAGON HAWK PRODUCTS  , BECAUSE YOUR TATTOO KITS HAVE A GREAT PRICE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME THAT IS STARTING OUT TATTOOING AND I CHECK OUT OTHERS BRANDS OF TATTOO KITS ,BUT NO  ONE HAD A BETTER DEALS ,BUT DRAGON HAWK IS THE PLACE TO START IF YOU LOVE TATTOOING AND WANT  GOOD DEALS OF TATTOO KITS, P.S WOW!  YOUR KITS ONLY HAVE A BIG BLACK INK BOTTLE THAT WILL LAST ME AWHILE AND SAVES ME MONEY, THANKS AND YOU GOT A COSTUMER FOR LIFE.....",86,13
All_Beauty,B006H8X3JO,4.0,positive,Good for the money everything is working well just don't use this ink!,13,14
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,I like it but its to low when I try to watch movies it is dim so what I'm saying here is its height is bad but otherwise its preety good.,31,0
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,"This fit my Trio perfectly,also you have a better grip on your tablet. I 'm glad the tablet is well protected now from breakage!",24,1

Fast Shipping
Fits on my 10"" tablet perfect and snug
Great purchase - you won't regret it.
Came with a FREE stlyus pen",25,3
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"Elastic clips were inconsistent on both pieces we purchased. The inconsistencies allowed the tablet to not only slide back and forth, but would slide right out the side and ultimately would hit the floor as though it had no case at all.",42,4
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,Does not work its just another universal case just as someone else said you have to remove it from case to use camera,23,5
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,doesn't really work for a tablet. the corner pieces sit on the on/off button :(,15,6
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,"Flimsy and tablets don't stay on. Also, very thin and clumsy.",11,7
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"It's ok, but the little holding elastic bands are hoaky and done always work too good",16,8
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"These are great cases. I bought them for the tablets that my Grandkids got for Christmas. If they can't wreck them, no can.",23,9

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,These are ok.  They don't really fit our tablets and the fasteners keep moving all over the place.,18,12
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,It fits my trio stealth g4 10.1 the clamps are tight but because it slips easily from the corners it may not be that good for carrying around.,28,13
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,This was better than I expected.  Sooooo inexpensive but good quality and holds my tablet firmly.  thank you.,18,14
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,My daughter ordered this so I cannot rate it as she purchased it for herself.  She said she liked it so I am happy that she is happy.  It arrived as promised and was packed securely.,36,15
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"I love this case! It's everything I've been looking for and great protection for my tablet. I was worried about the corner tabs not holding my tablet securely, they hold great, way better than I could ever imagine.
Thank you!",40,16
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,Case is fine. Amazon did not send bonus gift (stylus) with it.,12,17

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,Great product. Delivered on time. I am hppy!!,8,19
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"I use this on my Trio Stealth G2 10.1 tablet. It does fit and but slips frequently. I cut off the tabs and use it only to protect the screen.
I don't recommend if you have a 10.1 tablet, however, it works/fits my sister's 9 inch tablet and does not slip.",51,20

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,I just purchased my first tablet and was a little hesitant in ordering this product...received it in the mail really fast and was shocked to see that it is very sturdy and holds the tablet without it being lopsided....love this and would recommend it to anyone out there.,48,29
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,Its ok but not what I thought it would be. I brought 2 and I'm not as happy as I could be. That could be my thoughts only. I don't dislike the cases. I wouldn't buy another one. In all the case is good and protects your tablet very well.,50,30
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,"For the Price it offers More Protection Than the Soft Cases, But, The Tablet Fell From the Arm of a Recliner & the Screen Still Cracked Because the Case Doesn't Lock.  if you Have Children or Pets, I Suggest a Case With a Locking Latch",45,31

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,This cover does not fit the Trio Stealth. The corner pieces do not stay in place and are not large enough to hold the tablet. The case does not stay in the upright position when trying to stand it up.  Very disappointed.,42,36

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,"The prongs to hold the case in place always slip off, never keeps a hold. That makes the tablet unstable and it falls out",24,38
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,Bought these for the kids' Christmas present. Not too happy with them. The corner holders are constantly slipping off. Doesn't feel very stable.,23,39
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,1.0,negative,The tablet keeps popping ouy of the little brackets. Not good quality at all. Having to buy a new case drom a different company,24,40
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,4.0,positive,The case fits which is great as the tablet I bouggt is oddly shaped.  The elastic bands on this case makes it good for most tablets.,26,41

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"When I received it, it was the holidays and it was a gift to go along with a tablet that I had purchased. After the holiday and the excitement wore down we found that it is not as sturdy as I thought. Also there is no opening to take pictures with the case on the tablet. Not happy with it but I learned my lesson. You get what you pay for.",71,53

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,"Advertises the case is for the ""Trio Stealth G2"". However, in order to take a picture you must remove your tablet from this case before you can take a picture. Most cases you can leave your tablet right in the case while taking pictures. Also,this case does not stand when reading as shown in picture, it falls over. Just for those two reasons alone this case is worthless.",68,58
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,2.0,negative,Advertised for Trio tablet.  However there is no hole for the rear facing camera so you cannot use the camera if the tablet is in the case.,27,59

Wish that there was a better selection of color like black one red is ok",21,60
All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"I really like this tablet case it fits the trio stealth-10 perfectly, the claws hold the tablet very snugly to the case, there is no room for play that would allow it to fall out.

All_Beauty,B00H4EEK1K,5.0,positive,"I bought this as a gift for my dad since he also got the newest kindle fire, the Kindle Fire HD 10.1, and he loves it! Not only that, but it fits perfectly!

All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"I liked it a lot, it looks really nice on a hand and it doesn't look cheap. The only thing that was bad , few of the little rings in the chain were not closed properly, so I had to fix it with pliers so that it wouldn't fall apart.",50,0

When she received it, the chain was not connect to the already smashed ring, or the bracelet. Part of the bracelet was held together with a green goo...instead of soldered together.

All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,4.0,positive,"this is a really cute accessory. the ring is an incomplete circle so you can adjust it just right, the chain to the wrist is a good length. the one real drawback is it's actually pretty hard to connect he clasp on the bracelet part without help because of the weight  but I salved that by replacing the clasp with a magnate.",62,16
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,5.0,positive,Kinda big I have small wrists. Very cute though,9,17
All_Beauty,B00ITNNI4K,1.0,negative,This thing fell apart like 10 min after I gave it to my Girlfriend. I would not recommend this to anyone. Do not buy this cheap thing. We didn't expect a high quality piece of jewelry as it was for Halloween but it didn't even make it to the party.,50,18

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,1.0,negative,"I am a nurse, so I thought these pens would be great and easy to access attached to my badge holder.  This first one exploded the first day I used it all over my scrubs and I looked like a slob all day.  I thought it was just a freak accident so I decided to give another one a try.  The same thing happened.  There is definitely a flaw in the design and I will not be using them again.",80,1
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I use these quite frequently to take notes since I don't have a smartphone. The only complaint I have is that sometimes if you push the pen into its cap too hard, it will break. This is only a problem since the cap is what attaches to the keychain. Aside from that, though, they work fine. Great for carrying around in a pocket.",63,2
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I have no need to write with pink, purple or green ink.  Blue is OK, but Black is the best.",20,3
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"I need a pen attached to my keychain at work at all times.  I have always used the mini R.S.V.P. pens from Pentel.  Most stores in my area are not carrying them so I found these.  Sorry...but I hate them.  They are very small for writing, and since I attach them to my keychain, the round plastic hole for the chain to go through broke in one day!  (My other pens never broke, thicker plastic.)  If you just need a tiny pen and not using it for hanging it would be ok.  I won't buy these again since I have found the Pentel pens I want on Amazon. Oh, and the chain they come on is a joke, totally worthless.",120,4
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I'll have to agree with the reviewer that said the pen cap pulls off too easily if used in a keychain fashion, as described and intended, however I was looking for a very small pen to keep in my pocket, and it works very well for that. I unscrew the little keychain attachment, and the lid stays on in my pocket so I'm always ready to write in a notebook I carry; I frequently have a better pen, but not always. This one fits your hand pretty well if you remove the cap and place it at the but of the pen, otherwise it's a little too stubby. The product could certainly be improved by making the cap fit a little tighter, but it works well for what I wanted.",130,5
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Honestly, if I had known the cap would fall or pull off so easily, I never would have purchased this product. I should have looked for push button or twist pens instead. These pens are small, fit well on a keychain, and writes okay, but I almost lost the cap(s) quite a few times. Due to the price point, it's not worth the time returning, but I won't buy again.",70,6

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,Good deal for the number of pens. Definitely wrap a strip of tape around the head of the pen to keep the pen from falling out of the cap if you keep them on your keys/if they will be yanked around a lot.,43,8

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,These pens are great as they fit in your pocket. I use them on a lanyard for taking notes in the field and they don't hang as low as a regular pen would. Amazon seems the only place you can actually find this pen size.,45,33

Great idea, but not so great product for it's intended use.  I couldn't make any of these pens last more than a week before the pens started falling out of their cap.  With normal use, some of the caps cracked, and some of them just stopped clicking onto the pen.

It's pretty frustrating when you try to grab your pen in the middle of examining a patient, and there's nothing dangling there but a pen cap.",106,41

Better in some ways than the nite eyez ones, because you don't have to unclip anything to get your pen, just pull free of the cap and write. My wife clips one to her scrubs pantleg loop. Plus, they're dirt cheap! Lose one, Goes through the laundry, no tears.",54,49

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,"I like that these pens all have black ink. The orange, green, etc. ink pens that you find in some of these sets have limited value if you are not a teenage girl. These pens are half the length of typical pens, but you can flip the cap over to lengthen them for comfortable writing. The small size makes these great for carrying in a pocket when you're on the go and the cap style prevents leaking. Construction is cheap and lightweight, but they are a decent value at less than a dollar per pen. The keychains seem pretty flimsy and I discarded them; didn't really want that feature anyway.",110,54

Not a good product to attach to a key ring...,62,56
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,2.0,negative,"Maybe I'm just hard on things in my pocket, but these things break very easily.  On every one of them the screw that connects the pen to the key ring pulls out of the cap, stripping the hole.  I've tried using super glue to put it back together which works for a little while.  Also the pen does not stay in the cap very securely.  Much prefer the Nite Ize pocket pen by Inka.",74,57
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These are great for my purposes.  I always need a pen that is easy to carry around and I'm the type that like to carry as little as possible so these are great b/c they fit in the coin pocket of a pair of jeans.  I never noticed them until I need to write something down.  I'm not sure why the description listed the product box with Product Dimensions 6.5 x 2.8 x 0.4 inches but the pens are 3.5 inches long and they are all black ink.  I was worried since the description mentioned Color Red/Blue/Black/Green/Purple but these are describing the color of the casing not the ink.  I needed simple blue or black but cringed at the description of the colors.  I can't believe that I'm excited about pens.,131,58

The pens are moderately tight in the cap. They don't fall out with normal use, but you need to be careful if you put them in your pocket or otherwise create a situation where the pen can be ""friction locked"", allowing it to be pulled loose of the cap.

The pens are a little on the small side but manageable for quick tasks, such as writing a signature or jotting down a note. There is no way you would want to use it all day, unless you have small hands.",128,61

All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,5.0,positive,These pens are a great idea but because there is no twist to secure the pen in place it is subject to dislodge  and be lost . Other than that it's a very handy tool .,36,65
All_Beauty,B00NLNO554,4.0,positive,like the True Utility pen the problem is that taking your keys in and out of your pockets the pen will pop off.

Honestly the worst purchase I've ever made, I don't even want new ones or anything to do with these guys ever. I would only recommend these to people who want to waste money.",89,19

I got them to feel like I have piercings and to trick my friends because I'm not allowed to have piercings yet. Anyways, this is a great product that looks real! The only problem I have with the product is getting them on. They are so small that it is really hard to get it on your lip in the right place. They are so small you have to practically rip you lip off. But when on they are secure and feel great. Also, if you are like me and are sensitive to certain materials THIS IS FOR YOU I am very sensitive to certain materials and this I was having a reaction to, so be careful. But the product is great and looks real. And the color is fantastic, I got 5 rose gold colored rings. They are beautiful. I can't blame the small size to get on your lip though because it makes the product more secure when on. So overall I am very satisfied and give this product 5 stars.",185,20

I also altered purple to silver, and then to blue I just used nail polish remover and then changed the color so super simple, and I totally recommend them don't threat if u don't get the right color ",108,21

All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,These are awesome! They look very real and I've been convincing everyone I meet. The only problem is that the rings really pinch your skin but you don't feel it after a while. I also didn't get much color variety. I only received 3gold and 2 black rings. Which is completely fine with me I can't complain because those colors make the rings look even more real but otherwise they're great! I also received it about 3 weeks earlier than expected!,81,44
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I bought some of these and they don't hurt and they did not put a hole on you. No matter where you put them. I wore them all day long on my lip because that's where the original piercing is. And ther was no hole left by these fake ones. The reason I wore this was because I was taking a break from my real piercing's. I was quite comfortable with these and I will buy them again.,78,45
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I only got blue and purple but other than that they are great,13,46
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Slow shipping and it hurts too much when I wear it. And its easy to lose,16,47
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"They're perfect for what I wanted them for, and they look very good. The only problem was that they didn't come in multiple colors, just five blue ones. If the lack of different colors doesn't bother you, then I would definitely recommend these.",43,48
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,I ordered these and it took a month and a half and it gave me all 5 blue like not worth it. ,22,49
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,"Omg, these are great, I really loved them. I've been wanting to get my nose pierced for a long time but been to scared. Lol look real!!!",27,50
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,Though they make a good fake septum piercing...it came with 4 pinks and a red. Was really hoping I would get one in each color...AS ADVERTISED in the picture :(.,30,51
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"It took a while, but i got them. They are easy to use, but i guess it's too big for my lip. I use them as nose piercing. I lost 2, 1 doesn't quite work and the other 2 are the one's that work well. As soon as i got them, i wiped them with rubbing alcohol just in cade",60,52
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,They hurt a tiny bit but I love how they look.,11,53
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,5.0,positive,Just got them today and I love them.  They gave me a variety of colors and are good quality:) I highly recommend these and the price is great!,28,54
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,They are fake they are horrible they keep falling off,10,55
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,they're great! i got them to trick my friends and family. and it worked perfectly! of course i'm gonna use them for everyday use. they do pinch you for a few minutes but it stops after a bit and feels perfectly fine. i gave it 4 stars because i got four silver and one blue.. even though it was supposed to come with a variety of colors. but it's okay! I wanted silver anyway. :),75,56
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,"Received 5 of them , one of it was Rusty another one deformed and looking rusty not made for the nose even to small as a use for ears or any else also they all having a dirty silver look no colored ones been packed its just looks old like they been not storaged well or been just laying around ,very disappointed and feel tricked. Don't waste your money and time. Would like to receive my money back.",78,57
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,These earnings are really cute!:) They are a little difficult to maneuver at first but you get the hang of them very quickly. The quality is wonderful for the price. I highly recommend this item.,35,58
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,I was kind of dissapointed that they gave me all silver but it freaked my mom out which i wanted!,20,59
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,1.0,negative,Don't buy!!!!  Came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored.,11,60
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,"I recieved 6 but they came in pairs of three colors- Pink, red, and silver. It wasn't a problem however, I wanted silver ones and the price of this was great so the extra pink and red rings were like an extra. They came in a small package, the delivery was fast, and overall I consider this to be a good purchase.",62,61
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,4.0,positive,Just got mine in the mail 4 gold 1 silver not the colors I wanted but can easily change the color by using nail polish or markers and they fit perfectly for my nose a bit tight on the lip tho  but works great,44,62
All_Beauty,B00NV6A3P2,2.0,negative,All the earrings that I got were pink.... I wanted multicolored,11,63

All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,Sponges are very soft. Perfect for blending. They do expand when wet just a bit. Cleaner works great too.,19,0
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,Great product for a great price.  Easy to clean and good product,12,1
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,They are ok. A little to firm so it makes using the different shapes a little difficult.,17,2
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,"Gave it 4 stars because the product is good, but I found out I'm not a fan of sponges for applying makeup. I like brushes better.",26,3
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,Four stars because thought they'd be bigger .overall there okay . I still need to try them out . So I'll update in a few .,26,4
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Not worth a penny. Sponges broke off handles within days. Don't waste your money.,14,5
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,Good price but not very good quaility. In this sense you kind of get what you pay for. Sponges are very stiff.,22,6
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,"These sponge brushes make blending my facial makeup a BREEZE!  Every time I need to do a heavy contour, I reach for these brushes rather than my beauty blender.  I find this product easier to manipulate.  They are sturdy and well built, and everything arrived intact.

The makeup brush cleaner is also very very useful.  I was easy to see when a brush was truly clean due to the residual makeup being very visible against the purple silicon.

This bundle is a great value for the price and I would definitely recommend this product if you frequently contour or blend your facial makeup!",103,7
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,"Only one of these sponges I was satisfied with and that was the teardrop; the other two seemed a bit flimsy.  When I used the cleaning item that came with the sponges, it tore through the sponges so I am no longer able to use them.  Not very satisfied with this product; wish it was of better quality.",58,8
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Great price but terrible chemical smell and brushes will not apply my blush cream like I want,17,9
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,One of the pieces wasn't entirely glues on and broke off when I was applying makeup to it. But everything else was fine,23,10
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,Cheap. Handle came out of all of them,8,11
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,2.0,negative,Waste of money. Too small to evenly spread anything and soaks up all my product.,15,12
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,these are inexpensive and very useful. They were smaller than I expected but you have to remember that they are essentially a brush style sponge applicator/ blendor. They get the job done and I love them.,36,13
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,4.0,positive,It feel a little to harsh for my face..,9,14
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,1.0,negative,brushes are poorly made and fell apart after only using it twice.,12,15
All_Beauty,B010DER7HG,5.0,positive,cute........they apply concealer very well. no messy fingers...,8,16

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Took about 25 day to get here. I love the Cherry Red color!,13,2
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"It really lasts so I love it. It can withstand food, drinks, washing, rubbing, etc. It lasts on my lips for more than 24 hours so it's worth a shot!",30,3
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Nothing looks like what I saw in YouTube/Facebook,8,4
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Doesn't peel off well. Gets stain all over fingers. Light color stays on for few hours at most. Not worth the money. Sadly a disappointment. It did make for a funny facebook live post, because it doesn't work like it should.",41,5
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"I did not like the tint color, it was too light, the lipstick stain didn't lady as promised.",18,6
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,these are great before going out to a big event! its very pigmented and it will literally stay on ALL day! I usually apply mine with just a little lip brush and let it dry completely before peeling it off! the color lasts all day without having to worry about reapplying anything else.,53,7
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Its not long lasting at all, once you drink or eat , it just disappear",15,8
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,It wasn't a rich red like the advertisements show. Also would horribly stain my teeth.,15,9
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,The top almost popped off at first use. The applicator part had a rough piece of plastic so couldn't smooth it onto my lips. Super funny texture and unfortunately left a weird color. I really wanted to like it but it was horrible on all accounts,46,10
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I bought two different colors of these. I am that girl that HATES wearing stuff on my lips and reapplying throughout the day. These are great! I use a small lip brush to apply that I bought cheap from CVS. Make sure your lips are mosturized before using. Apply it slowly covering lips and don't close your mouth and let lips touch until dry. It will look funny but don't worry! I let it dry for about 5-10 minutes then peel off! It looks great! I sometimes put Chapstick over top of it if I want that shiny gloss look. After about 6 hours it starts to wear off for me but it will be different for everyone. I love these for nights out or events where I don't want to keep reapplying lipstick. Plus my husband loves it bc he can kiss me without transfer and I can eat and drink with no problem. Last pic I posted was after 4 hours of it on and eating lunch (cherry red was applied that day)

I recommend to all the lazy girls that still wanna look great ",187,11
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"This does what it is supposed to do. Note that if your skin is dry, peeling off this lip treatment may hurt a bit, so I just rubbed with tissue paper.",31,12
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Love the color of this product! I just don't like how its hard to get on evenly.,17,13
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"The stain did not work for me, but it worked for my mother. I'm confused on the product.",18,14
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"It worked,  kind of.. It didn't Peel well.. Was to thin to grab easy and color wiped mostly off after and the rest only lasted an hr or 2. Color was pretty and it was  cheap.",36,15
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,it does what a stain does in the begging a little goes along way .  once you get to the end then its a little stickier but overall pretty good,30,16
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"It's very pigmented,.. Really hard to put on, its sticky and takes a long time to put on. But overall its really good i like it..",26,17
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Very hard to apply.  Very hard to wait 20 minutes for the tint to dry.  The tint also did not actually peel off, but I had to rub it and finally rub a damp towel over my lips to get off all the pieces.  The color was lighter than I expected and it was not long lasting.",57,18
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"It is impossible to get a clean line. The container was approximately 25% full so you had to tip the head back and tube upright in order to get the goo out, thus no mirror view because you are looking at the ceiling.

Took over a month to arrive and it totally sucked- it deserves no stars.",57,19
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,It doesnt go on easily too clumpy and stiky,9,20
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Takes to long to work, then just looks like I ate something red.",13,21
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Shipping took like a month and it does not work good, it doesnt stay that long, it taste nasty, you're better  off buying a lipstain",25,22
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Cool idea but deff not as easy to put on as we see in videos...ends up on teeth n stains your fingers....but does leave a nice stain on lips when everything else is cleand up,35,23
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"I love the idea of waterproof lipstick that doesn't get on anything, but this one does. It was soo liquidy, pretty sure that's not how it is supposed to be and the top part was torn off, but I fixed that. After a long time of keeping it on my lips, I pealed it and the lipstick didn't take affect at all. I was really disappointed. This is not how it's advertised.",72,24
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,My daughter uses this occasionally and likes it,8,25
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,easy to apply but it a pain when it gets on the cracks of the lip. and gets on teeth when I smile,23,26
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Cute color and staun, but is really messy.",8,27
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,eh.  there are much better brands.  this is loaded with chemicals and i can't help but feel like i am doing my body a disservice.  it takes a lot of time and patience to get on evenly and just isn't worth it.,42,28
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,this is good for party favors for little girls and would be a hit...this brand peels off nicely,18,29
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I bought two of these the red one is completly unusable. It's so clumpy does not go on smooth.  The taste of this product is gross. I would not buy again.,31,30
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Owmygee! My liptint arrived this morning and it's so nice. It look so good on my lips  So happy for this product. Surely gonna get another one. ,27,31
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I loved this product it works quickly and almost instantly at first I didn't know if this was the peel off one but it was and it stayed in for te whole day I strongly recommend this,37,32
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,It was in perfect condition when I recieved it and it arrived like a week sooner than expected. The color is just what I wanted and really lasts all day. I love it.,33,33
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I like the product, but I do recommend using a lip brush rather than just the squeeze tube for a more precise and even application.",25,34
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,It is super messy to put on and really really sticky. I had to apply it like every hour because the color came off very quickly and the my upper lip didn't not get the same color my bottom lip did. Very sad it doesn't work on my skin =(,50,35
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"These are not meant  for tan to dark skin ladies. I think my lips are somewhat dark, so you can barely see the color on my lips. I picked out the darkest shade too but it's still too light for a tan girl like me.",45,36
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Love the color and its final look. A little bit sticky when putting on, but easy to peel of (don't hurt at all). Highly recommended. Took 1 month to arrive.",30,37
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Don't waste your money. This stuff is horrible- it got all over the place and stains everything (fingers, teeth, cabinets). Consitancy of product is awful- has huge globs that come out. Seriously- don't waste your money.",36,38
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I love this product . It was super new. The shipping was way faster than I had thought it would be . The product got here in perfect shape. Overall the lip colored stayed on all day . I would recommend you to buy this!!!!,45,39
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Applying lipsticks wouldn't be a hassle anymore with this lip tattoo.,11,40
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"This is a terrific little addition to the make-up case. It's a little challenging to use the first time but after some trial and error it works great.

First you should use a cotton swab to apply it, this gives you a lot more control which is important as this is intended to stain and does.

It takes a while to dry and you must keep your mouth open or you'll have a mess on your hands. Cotton balls under your tongue help help with the extra saliva, not attractive but effective.

You can also use a hair dryer to speed up the process, however the longer it stays on the better the results.

Interpreting it off use a nail brush to scrub your hands if you keep coconut oil on hand it works great for removal.

On average the color lasts around 8-10 hours with eating, drinking, and smoking.

I've recommended this to several friends and my sister and will definitely be purchasing more.",165,41
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,Terrible ! It feels like chalk on your lips ,9,42
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Just received mine, was very excited I'm not allergic to anything. Put this product on my lips it's was burning and made my lips swollen
Will never try this product again",31,43
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I love it!!! I ordered the cherry red. It is so pretty and peeling it off was oddly fun and satisfying. It came super early and in great condition. It is a little smaller than I thought but it's worth it. The application was fairly easy and it looks kinda messy but the end result is gorgeous!!!,57,44
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Seems like it would work really well, but it froze in shipping so it may have ruined the consistency",19,45
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,I can eat a red tootsie pop and have the same effect.,12,46
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Too thick to put on properly. Was hard to get out of the bottle. The top is poorly made so if you have to push hard enough to get the product out, (which comes out in a giant messy blob) it popped off and stained my nails and hands. Worst mess I ever paid for. And if you get your lips wet the stain never stops rubbing off. It stains your lips but it is a dry mess. Also don't use with your favorite lip gloss. It will put the color all over your wand.",95,47
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"This product is alright. It does drain the lips.. However, it goes on clumpy and sticky, and it looks like you became a vampire and have blood on your lips. It takes forever to dry and it doesn't peel off like it's supposed to. I would NOT recommend it. Also, if you have cuts on your lips, it may burn. Use with caution.",63,48
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I'm pretty satisfied with this product. :) It is a bit tricky to apply b/c it's gooey, so you have to apply in a quick swift motion. I watched a tutorial on an application suggestion & that helped. I left it on for 10 min. & it dried with awesome results. It delivered a nice deep cherry red. It even stayed on even after eating dinner. I would buy this again!",71,49
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"It works really well! easy to apply if you just take your time, and lasts a long time. It also came earlier than expected.",24,50
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"It looks like I drank some cherry kool-aid and it stained my lips red. It's nearly impossibly to get it all the same shade.. it's super splotchy. Plus you cannot stay in the lines of your lips well at all, and it takes like 30 minutes to fully dry. Definitely not an on the go lip color, you need a mirror and about 30 minutes to apply and let dry. Not impressed at all.",74,51
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Overall the color lasts a long time on your lips but it takes a long time for the product to dry on your lips and after you peel it off (which is a mess) it just looks like I've had a glass of red kool-aid.,45,52
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"highly recommended , its not irritating and some ingredients are natural like rose hips oil, aloe, natural fruit essence and also with vitamin E.
I have very sensitive lips so I choose the lipstick that i am using..
jeny!",39,53
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,It's thick and messy;impossible to apply properly the way you would any other lipstick or lipstain; there are much better choices.  I would not buy it again,27,54
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"I love this product! I got it in Cherry Red and the finish was like a beautiful bright red lipstick, and it's a pretty good sized tube. I've only had it on for about an hour but it has not come off at all, and it feels like you have nothing on. My only issue was that some of it was leaking out of the sides, of the top, but it didn't drip on anything or make a mess when applying so it wasn't a big deal. I've been trying out different lip stains to recommend one to my best friend for her upcoming wedding, and this is definitely at the top of the list!",115,55
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"very bad product
Tathurt my lips and blood came when  I remove.",12,56
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,I got the cherry red. I really like its color. The longer you have it on the darker it gets. I really like it a lot.,26,57
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"I think mine came defective. The gloss came out of the tube extremely thick, almost like old glue. It was virtually impossible to apply. The color is pretty in the end, but the mess is not worth it.",38,58
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,So although it is messy to apply it really works and does not leave lips dry just put some chapstick after application and your lips will look beautiful :),29,59
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,"Zero stars. I wasn't happy with it at all. I first seen it on Facebook and it looked like something i would like, but no. I was safly wrong. Came late, hard to put on, dries way to fast, and it doesn't taste very good.",45,60
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,It provides long lasting color and safety on my lips every time I use it.,15,61
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"I like this lipstick, the only bad thing its that is not very easy to apply. the smell is delicious.
I would recommended if would be easier to apply and if it wouldnt dry fast",35,62

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,Love it but it makes a big mass,8,64
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,Its pretty cool It came perfect and the color is nice I will definitely purchase again. Super glad I bought this item.,22,65
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,"A great value and a terrific color payoff. To be honest the only issue I had was waiting for the product, because it did arrive a month late. Which doesn't surprise me since it only cost 3$",37,66
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,5.0,positive,I received it today and tried it on and live it perfect color it looks great,16,67
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,4.0,positive,"Pros: works really, really well. I applied it last night around 8 pm to try it out, peeled it off and was left with a beautiful stain. Didn't bother washing it off before bed and woke up this morning with beautiful lips! And no transfer on my pillow either

Cons: it tastes REALLY bad. Like...there is something extremely bitter in the gloss before you peel it off and if you don't get all the pieces off right away it lingers on your lips and has a horrible bitter taste. But I mean, it isn't meant to be ingested or licked like a lip gloss is so maybe that was my fault.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Shipping was decent. I ordered it the 26th of December and got it on the 4th of January.",135,68

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,Super disappointed with this; goes on the inside of my mouth when that's obviously not where I'm placing it. Super icky and the stains I try to clean off from inside of my mouth causes the entire stain to be removed,41,71

All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"Do not use this unless you have a very steady hand and are possibly a professional makeup artist. My sister gave me some and I thought it was lip gloss. Got some out of the lines as it were and yes, it definitely lasts. My hands and lips and in general the lower half of my face have been bright red for hours now. If you can get it where you want it Im sure it would be a lasting and lovely lip color. But you really need to get it on perfect the first time, or you end up looking like a toddler who ate a crayon.",108,78
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,2.0,negative,"It's a really cool concept. The application however is a mess. I would recommend using a QTip or lip gloss applicator versus just using it directly from the tube. The stain doesn't turn out that red once it is peeled off, it honestly looks like you just ate a Popsicle. So if you're into that look, this product is for you. Overall it requires too much time to put on. I have used it twice in the year that I have had it.",83,79
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,Does not seem to be something i would wear long time and the material doesnt seem to stay on or look a certain way,24,80
All_Beauty,B011773O2U,1.0,negative,WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED IN MY LIFE! Not only is this a sloppy mess that doesn't really work but it BURNS to put on,26,81
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Love my new nail polish ! Essie have a great selection of shades and I am very glad they  have this one back.,23,0
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Great color, but horrible formula!  It goes on thick and gloppy like a polish that has been sitting on a shelf for years. I expected more from Essie.",28,1
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"I love this color. I've heard a lot of complaints about the formula, so I was worried when I ordered it, but the bottle I got is a nice formula. It's not jelly-like, not thick. It's great.",37,2
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,I love the color and the consistency was OK for me but it doesn't wear well at all. I've worn it twice and both times it chipped almost immediately. I've only had it on for 36 hours and it looks like it has been on for a week...it is so chipped. This is not my usual experience with Essie polishes.,60,3
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"I had the original Chanel Ciel de Nuit back in the 90s and loved the color. I never had the original Essie Starry Starry Night, but I bought the revival today, and like all Essie polishes, I loathe the formula. They're always streaky and clumpy, and the brush is too small and hard to control. Color payoff is good after two coats, not as sparkly as the old Chanel it knocked off, but I wouldn't re-buy. About once a year, I buy an Essie polish, and then remember why I hate them. I should stick to Zoya.",97,4
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,All the colors are great but this one was the best.,11,5
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"I am sure the formula is great but the color just didn't work for me.  It was very shimmery and almost had a multi-color sheen to it.  Even my 2 14 yol twin daughters said it was ""too young"" for them.  However, I am sure someone else will love this color!  I had really hoped it would be kind of a blush-champagne color which it looked like in pix. (my bad)",71,6
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Beautiful color but chips after two days, even with expensive base and top coat.",14,7
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Well, it's a pretty color but that's about it. Chipped of the first day and the gel formula was very difficult to work with.",24,8
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,The color is amazing!!! I just love it! so glad it came back,13,9
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,Do NOT buy. Nail polish bottles arrived broken with nail polish coating EVERYTHING. AND they won't honor a return.,19,10
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Such a great color and really good coverage for a polish with glitter.,13,11
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"Great color, but chips way to easy. I do wash hands a lot but not long lasting.",17,12
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"Love Essie polish. This particular mix is pretty thin, but a couple of coats once dry is super cute. Will be using for the rest of the summer.",28,13
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,The consistency was too tacky and it was not as shimmery as advertised. I believe the original formula was better. However one coat was OK for my toes.,28,14
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"I don't know why Essie comes up in the 'luxury' category. I've never liked this polish; the colors are mostly bland, it chips quickly. Really this stuff is overpriced. It's not terrible but it's not high quality either",38,15
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,Very pretty color.  Perfect for a suttle look.,8,16
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Chipped within 3 hours of a professional manicure.  Would not recommend.  I am not a fan of Essie nail polish, especially after buying this.",24,17
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"I love Essie! Their nail polish is one of the smoothest applications I've found. The color has always been one of my favorite. It is light yet striking. I am normally not a fan of light colors but  This one has always been elegant, sophisticated, and timeless. I am so happy to have the color back on The market .",60,18
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"first essie polish of mine and i must say, besides the formula being a bit thick, its a great polish overall <3",22,19
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,"I have no issue with the coverage or consistency. I took the polish to my favorite salon and had them do it. However, I'm 26 and I think the color is too blue for me. Maybe for New Years or Vegas. But for work...it's a little much. Looks like what a 16 year old would wear to a dance. Pretty, but not for every day wear.",66,20
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Got the nail polish when they said I would and it is great! Love the color and the ease of putting it on.,23,21
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,"It certainly isn't identical to the original, but it is still a great polish! Semi-sheer gelly layer with slightly chunky square glitter, it does resemble a night sky, in a van Gogh kind of way--in that way, this one is probably more appropriately named than the original! Lasted a normal amount of time, and no staining.",56,22
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,4.0,positive,Great color. I really like it. The only bad thing about glitter polish is the removal. I hate it.,19,23
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,They were given as gifts. They loved them,8,24
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Not at all what I expected. It's not navy or dark blue, it is very much a bright royal blue. And I guess all the sparkles in the polish adhere to the glass bottle or get completely buried under the blue, because there were little to no sparkles on my nails.

If I had known this, I would not have bought it, because I've never used it.",67,25
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,2.0,negative,"Very thin formula, it takes way too many coats for it to even look like you have nail polish on. I would not recommend purchasing this one unless you want to go for a more natural look.",37,26
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,Very clumpy and goopy. Did not go on smoothly. Only used once.,12,27
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,1.0,negative,"Not what I was expecting at all. Usually Essie colors are true to color, this is one exception. Once applied the color is iridescent, with a lot of yellow / greens tones and even with three coats, it's still translucent. I have a few other colors from this Retro Revival line and love them but this one is not worth the almost $9.00 I paid.",65,28
All_Beauty,B0166R22CO,5.0,positive,Love this color! even more beautiful in person :},9,29
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,Either I received the wrong item or they are knowingly sending out something completely different. I received 3 gold pins with cheap white beads on them. No flowers or leaves at all and the beads don't even look like the little ones in the picture either so I'm getting a refund for this disappointment.,54,0
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,"When I ordered these, the description said silver. The ones I got were gold. They have since changed the description. Still, I was not happy.",25,1
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"The gold on these pins is VERY yellowy gold. I initially didn't like the color at all, but they ended up being pretty in my hair so I wore them anyway for my wedding.",34,2
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"Bought it to wear in my hair for a wedding. The pins looked very cute, I wore 2 of them side by side so it looked more like a barrette, and I gave the third piece to my younger sister so she could wear one as well. The pins were nice and stayed on the whole day of the wedding. Great product for a good price",66,3
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"very cute but seemed a little cheap and the gold is a bright gold and not a dark gold.
overall, it looked great and is reusable.",26,4
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,"I'm actually pretty happy with these! They are a very yellow gold which is the only thing I'm not super thrilled with since the photos look more subdued and brassy, but overall it's not a huge issue. They still look so pretty! I used them for my bridal portraits and they held up very well. I plan to use them for my wedding now as well. I do wish that the silver ones in the last photo were available to purchase as well, but I couldn't find them anywhere.",89,5
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,I was looking forward to these and in the silver/white version and instead I got this ugly yellow gold color. Disappointed. Will not use these.,25,6
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,I got these to match my jewelry and Maid of Honor and they were perfect! I loved them and they stood out nicely against my blonde hair. They stayed in really well throughout the night and I got multiple compliments on them,42,7
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,"These hair pins were absolutely perfect for my wedding day! During my trial, my make-up artist recommended getting hair pins to bring out and add a little bit more texture to my hairstyle. I bought these the week before my wedding and they ended up looking great with my up-do and against my dark hair. We decided to just use 2 in my hair since having all three seemed to be a little excessive. These hair pins were so inexpensive in comparison to other bridal hair pins and totally worth the cost. I definitely recommend these for a bride on her big day!",103,8
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,The metal had a cheap look to it. Didnt end up wearing it.,13,9
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,4.0,positive,They are very beautiful and of good quality. Unfortunately I only received 2 out of the 3 pins. The package looked like it had been returned. Overall beautiful.,28,10
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,2.0,negative,The gold is very cheap looking. I wanted these for my wedding but they look bad.,16,11
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,I ordered these for my wedding day and they worked great.  Easily adjustable to perfect your look and such a nice but simple embellishment.,24,12
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,5.0,positive,"the gold color is very gold, almost cartoonish gold. but I have dark hair, and the accent color for my wedding is gold, so it'll work out fine. but it was a bit of a shock when I first saw it. quality product.",43,13
All_Beauty,B016KGPK1Q,1.0,negative,The gold reminded me of Willy Wonka gold.,8,14

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"They were really cute, but left my fingers green.",9,1
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"Leaves a small green lining on your fingers but that should be expected for how cheap it is, the green isn't even noticeable if you leave the rings on, and one did break within 2 weeks sadly but I'm still loving the others.",43,2
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"I would have gave it five stars but one of the rings bent, not that it was a problem because I fixed it like that. But still not the best quality.",31,3
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Just like a set of forever 21 rings,8,4
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,"Great gift good variety of rings with a nice finish.
Worth the money by far!",15,5

All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,It did take forever to arrive but what can I expect it was super cheap and I think also free Shipping.  I'm very satisfied with the quality of the rings.,30,7
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,They were broken before I got the chance to open the bag.,12,8
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,All the rings are different sized and some fit some don't.,11,9
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,The rings snapped easily and the midi rings weren't very adjustable.,11,10
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,"I totally thought these would be cute for the summer/pool/beach. I would not want to take these in the water. The paint on it is all chipped and cracking.  There were 2 pieces that had jagged metal sticking out from the ring area.

3 pieces were adjustable and 3 were not. The ones that were not adjustable fit on my knuckles and we're not comfortable.

The metal is garbage. The paint is chipping and the sizing is weird. I might be able to use a couple as toe rings. Not worth what I paid for them.",96,11
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Came in as pictures the material isn't flimsy cute rings,10,12
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,They are made out of plastic. reminds me of costume jewelry for a 4 year old.,16,13
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"So I received my rings early, which was a big plus. They came in a small package and I was very pleased to see that they were perfect, although the rings seem to have the black paint chips, or something like that, stuck on the inside.",46,14
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,"They're cute, they're super affordable, they are just little trinkets after all. I got mine to hopefully spruce up some shots of manicures/nail art I'm doing. For me, not to wear for real :)",34,15
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,Poorly made broke as I put them on the first time. Cute style it it was made out of something else. Don;t waste your money.,25,16
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"Only one of them broke and I didn't like that one anyway lol. They're surprisingly sturdy for what you're paying. They're all different sizes. After a while, the color starts to get a little coppery. These rings are pretty good for the price.",43,17
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,"I like them, but they came it says it came in from Wish.",13,18
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,These are okay.. cheap metal so potential breaking.,8,19
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,4.0,positive,"These are really cute. They kind of bend, but it doesn't seem to be a bad thing. One of them bent almost all the way open while I was running around at work but it didn't break. As far as accent rings go they serve their purpose. Paint them with clear nailpolish so the won't make your fingers green.",59,20
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,"These rings are a cute design BUT the quality is that of a quarter prize machine at a grocery store, Save your money and wrap tinfoil around your fingers.",29,21
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,"These rings are very cheap. The metal is almost plastic-like. The designs are cute but the metal had flakes leftover from when they were stamped. Only three of the six were sanded, leaving sharp burs on the other three. I am dissapointed, but contented with the few rings of the set I can wear. I would still buy from this seller, as their service is wonderful and everything else I've bought from them has been excellent.",76,22
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,I was so excited when I received these. They are such a cute design. But they are so poorly made that one of them broke at a weak welding/soldering point less than 3 hours after putting it on.,38,23
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,5.0,positive,Plastic like.. Not what I expected. Most of them broke. You get what you pay for,16,24
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,2.0,negative,Love these little rings BUT you get what you pay for. All the open/adjustable rings break within the first two wears. The solid bands are a bit stronger. Realize these are a trendy short term accessory.,36,25
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,very very poor quality. All the rings broke and crumbled after 2 days,13,26
All_Beauty,B017BJ877K,1.0,negative,Broke the second I pulled them out of the package.,10,27
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"I was skeptical at first.....but I love Azorro hair brush straightener......it works super amazing, wish it would let me post my picture with the before and after.....well worth the money. and Support is amazing",34,0
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,My hair is quite short so I use this on my top layers with much success. On the shorties underneath I still have to hit it with the flat iron. As my hair grows back out to chin length I look forward to only needing this brush. It's quicker and effective.,51,1
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Purchased this about 2 weeks ago and needed to give a review on it. I really like it a lot. Its a great addition to my styling products. So, it has a great feature of shut offing if its not in use for a long time. It heats up in seconds and keeps the temperature constant. I love how it makes my hair look and feel. I can do my hair in seconds.",73,2
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,Wasn't the same brush shown in the picture. Didn't work when plugged in. Sent it back!,16,3

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,pulled out my hair and did not straighten at all.,10,5
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,does not work on curly hair as it states,9,6
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,this works great  it is much better than a regular flat iron,12,7
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Heavy and awkward to use.  You almost cannot use without hitting the buttons and changing the heat settings.  It does make a little difference but not enough to really notice.  The bristles will scratch your neck if not careful.  Would not buy again.,43,8
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"I really like this brush. And despite the fact that my hair is short, it still worked quite well. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",25,9

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"I was not sure this would work since I have extremely thick curly hair, so here it goes.  It does work! I let my hair dry naturally, and used the Ionic hair brush.  It really did work but not as well as my flat iron.  The pros is that is great for touch ups and it is easy to use.  This will be my everyday straightening tool, but when I want pin straight hair, I will continue to use my flat iron.  The Cons is that my daughters have already taken it over and I may have to order another one for myself.",103,15
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"Love this product! It heats quickly, easy to use and provides great results.  Worth the price!",16,16

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,It works a bit better than I expected still experimenting,10,18
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,Great for straightening your hair.  I use a comb just to get tangles out prior to the use but like it better then a flat iron.,26,19

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,"This brush works amazing on my course dry hair!!!!!  I only need to run it thru once, and move to the next section of hair!!!
There is 1 draw back, the buttons to raise and drop the temp are on the side where your fingers are when using it.",49,23
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"Easy to use and I get great results which is important to me since I have very coarse, frizzy, kinky, unmanageable hair!",22,24
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,It was a gift for our daughter. She tried it but it didn't work on her hair. It left it as frizzy as it was before she started.,28,25
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,4.0,positive,"It really works great, but the only problem I have is the buttons should be in a different place because I held it I was also either adjusting it up or down and off because my hand presses the buttons as I held it to do my hair. other then that I do like it.",55,26
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Not impressed. I have short hair with swoopy ends. The brush is not able to do my ends at all.,20,27

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,Not happy with the quality of this product at all. And being I paid so much for it makes me even the more unhappy..,24,29
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"I ended up returning it.  It was so big and bluky, and it did not stop the frizz.  It actually made my hair more frizzy.  BUT - the company was really great with my return and if you have thick hair, this would probably be perfect!",46,30
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,5.0,positive,I am so happy that I bought this.  It really does straighten your hair and is so much less time consuming than a hair straightener.,25,31
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,"It's an excellent concept, but this brush just doesn't get hot enough to do my hair and I had it maxed at 415. I have thick, long and kind of wavy hair and when I read the manual for the recommended heat and I had it maxed at 415 and it took a good 10+ times through the same section to get it even mildly straight. Plus, I believe it states that it's static free? Def not.",77,32
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,I had some difficulty using the brush if my hair wasn't 100% dry and tangle free.  When using the brush I kept touching the temperature controls and changing the temperature. I got this brush so that I could straiten my hair everyday but it's a bit to difficult to do that.,51,33

All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,1.0,negative,I purchased 3.  Two for me and 1 as a gift....I hope it works.  But I used mine 1 time each.  They both stopped working.  AMAZON REFUNDED my money and I bought a better unit!!! Thanks AMAZON!,37,37
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,"I was really disappointed in this hot hair brush ... The power button is right in the middle of the handle where your hand naturally is placed when using the brush, so you are constantly turning it off -- super poor design.  I had been looking for a brush that was actually a hot tool rather than just a hot air brush, but I noticed that it took way more effort to straighten my long thick hair with this than with a flat iron.  It would not tolerate very much hair in the bristles, which is discouraging because the brush head is rather large.  Even after straightening with a flat iron, using the brush to give it some lift, body &/or curl, I just couldn't make it happen without investing much more time than I had patience.",137,38
All_Beauty,B018AVVYAK,2.0,negative,It broke one week later when my aunt used it. It's basically a blowdryer,14,39

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"This is such an awesome idea! I don't have a real makeup vanity to put everything on and also do my makeup. I hung this on the wall right next to where I have my makeup stored and it is perfect for doing my makeup or eyebrows. It has a light so it's very easy to see. The one side is magnified so it is easy to see when you are plucking eyebrows, or eyeliner. I put it up so the installation is very easy. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",99,1
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"The amount and quality of the light provided by the thin strip that encircles the mirror is inadequate.

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,5.0,positive,"Just like in the hotel. Very nice and makes me feel pampered. No more leaning way over the counter to see in the mirror and I love that it pushes back out of the way. I would recommend this mirror. Lights up nicely.
I did receive a discount to review this item and this is my honest opinion not biased.",60,3
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"Supporting hardware does not seem very sturdy but it works very well.  Mirror functions perfectly.  My problem is the lighting which I needed for shaving in a dark location.  I could use a brighter light, hence a 4 vs 5.  Batteries were not difficult to install.  Overall a goodproduct .",50,4
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,Disappointed.  When I pull it out to use it will not stay in place.,14,5
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Terrible product. The quality of this mirror is awful. I bought this after my old wall-mounted mirror fell and broke, and I thought the light would be great. The light flickers and won't stay on, and even for the few moments it is on, it is so dim it is worthless. I have taken it apart twice and replaced the batteries (not easy to do either) and no improvement. The mirror surface is also pretty small and magnification is not good. I tried emailing the seller twice to see if my unit was just defective but they never bothered to reply.",101,6

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,1.0,negative,"Wall extension seems flimsy but I never got far enough to find out.  The battery case extremely difficult to twist open; once it is, the edges of the open case are sharp. (Yep, it cut me)  Returned for refund.",39,8
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror was easy to install and works fine, but the reason we bought it was the lighting. The LEDs are very dim and almost useless.",26,9
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,Mine appears to be defective. Needed a wrench to screw the part that holds on the mirror. I couldn't do it myself. Also very difficult to take the mirror apart for battery installation.,33,10
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for, but two weeks into ownership one of the brackets on one of the hinges broke. There really isn't kind of hack or easy fix either, appears to be shoddy materials and/or manufacturing.",43,11

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror is just fine, however, the perimeter light is so soft or 'low' that it's pointless.  Don't buy this product for the light feature, you'll be disappointed.",28,15

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,"The mirror is far too heavy for the extension arm and it's very wobbly.  I could never get the mirror case open to insert batteries, so I can't rate the usefulness of the lighted feature.",35,19

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"It was a bit hard to open to get the batteries in but once done, the light is really quite bright. Not sure why others said the opposite. Installation was very easy and it seems well made. Not at all flimsy.",41,26
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"This product is heavy as it is expected to be, but the screws and the mounts they give you need to be better. I have this horrible fear that the cheap drywall screws that came with it are going to break and I am going to end up with 7 years bad luck. The mirror is beautiful though and the led is just bright enough that I can use it and not be blinded by it like some mirror lights. Overall I probably would buy it again , I'd just invest in a better mounting screw set",97,27
All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,2.0,negative,The LED light isn't as strong as it sounds like it should be. The construction isn't all that sturdy either. The mirror part is wobbly and I'm always afraid it's just going to fall off onto the floor.,38,28

All_Beauty,B01AMSFNBK,4.0,positive,"All in all it's decent for what it mainly is, a mirror. The magnification is exactly what I was looking for. The light was a perk, but it's not very bright and really doesn't light up anything extra that my bathroom light doesn't. So I don't really use it.

The arm is a little loose from where it attaches to the wall. It swings slowly back towards the wall, but this could be from how it's mounted? But basically it works just fine for what I need it for!",89,31
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"The quality of the wig is outstanding and the style is very similar to the picture with a little trimming/thinning/styling. There is a lot of hair, evenly distributed through the lace cap and has sewn in clips to attach with ease. It was a little large at the top of the wig and it was very easy to sew a few tucks to take out some of the bulk.

The write up clearly states the color may be different than what is in the picture due to the monitor or lighting. The wig I see on my screen looks like a light brown with blonde highlights. The wig I received is the color of the highlights in the picture and is more blonde than light brown. If you are looking for light brown with blonde highlights, you may be disappointed. I like to play with different wig colors and styles and I am ok with the color. At this price you are getting a quality product and really can't go wrong, unless you aren't willing to do a little trimming or accept a slightly different color.",186,0

I have to rinse it in water to rinse off some residual product that's on it. But fine after that and the style holds. Brushing the wig makes it look even more satisfying. These wigs""exact"" same product are sold at a large online store for double the price. Buy it here. You'll love it",72,5

All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,2.0,negative,I bought for my mother. It looked ridiculous on her and she hated it. It was way too puffy. It would be nice if there was a size chart. I'm not sure if I can even return  it.,38,14

All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,5.0,positive,"Bought this for my 97 year old mother. She's in rehab and she needed to replace her previous one. Didn't want to spend too much fight unseen. I am amazed at the quality of thus wig. It looks just like her real hair!! It is thick bug feels soft to the touch.  Easy to style big combing. Looks just like real hair. This was supposed to be until we could take her hit s new one, now we'll keep this one permanently. Looks better than the expensive ones we've bought.",90,18
All_Beauty,B01BEX4GU6,4.0,positive,"I ordered this for a Halloween costume, it wasn't as curly as I needed so ordered a different one.  This one is very well made though.  Good fit.

All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,This cream has a nice light citrus scent and it doesn't irritate my super-sensitive skin.  I've been using it on my face and neck every day for 2 weeks now.

I would recommend this product for lightening sunspots.,49,5
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,5.0,positive,"I recently purchased and began using this product. Within a few days, I started to notice a subtle glow to my skin. I enjoyed that this product was not at all heavy feeling when applied. It was very easy to add to my daily routine.",45,6

All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,I applied every day after washing my face clean. I have used the entire product. Results. Zero. Not even a hint of a change in skin color. It doesn't work period.,31,10
All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,4.0,positive,"Disclaimer: I received this product for review. Opinions expressed are completely my own.

I've been using this skin lightening cream for over a week now and I must say I really like it's hydrating ability. I have a couple dark spots from newer breakouts and uneven skin and although I have not seen much change in them since using the product, I feel that with future use I will see more results. The cream itself is white in color and is a little thick. It has a light, kind of tropical scent. I find it very energizing and gets me more awake in the morning due to the smell. The cream leaves a not too heavy feeling on the face. It is very moisturizing. The moisture lasts throughout the day. I like also that the product is natural with no parabens or sulfates. The bottle is bigger than most creams that I have seen which is nice and I am excited to use the product and see future results. Overall I think this is a good moisturizing cream, that has a great energizing scent and provides long lasting hydration.",189,11

All_Beauty,B00J2AJ3U2,1.0,negative,"The 1.7fl oz that is claimed on bottle is actually fraudent. The bottle has less than 0.1 fl oz.
The whole quantity of the cream fits in that little middle bottle that is fitted inside the huge long bottle. Which is not 1.7fl oz by far. That's why the diptube is that short. (See images)

All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,"Color that I received wasn't listed, but I still like it. It took a long while to arrive, but it was still cute when I received it.

All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,Really cute but was a different material than I expected it to be. I think it's satin.,17,5
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,You are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be a color listed. Not worth the money.,21,6
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,5.0,positive,It's a bendable wire inside a cloth material that is very thin but it looks really cute and exactly like the pictures. Material is not the highest quality but is exactly what it's supposed to be.,36,7
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,2.0,negative,"I got some ugly funky color and while it looks cute on me, it's really small. I have a rather big head and so it doesn't reach all the way and the bow looks miniature instead of big like on the model. It's also made of cheap wire so be careful with it.",53,8
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,I'm very disappoined. I ordered 4 headbands and received three of the same material. What am I going to do with three of the exact same headband?,27,9

All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,4.0,positive,It's okay for the price got it sooner then expected wire started to poke out as soon as i put it on but easy to fix wish i could pick the color but i still love the one i got it is tan with orange dots,46,11
All_Beauty,B00NV6VGY4,1.0,negative,Do not like it at all. From the looks of the pic it was suppose to be one of the denim headbands and I received a light pink polka dot one. I have no use for it.,37,12

All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,I love the colors but the magnet did not work AT ALL!! Good thing I had ordered another magnet to go with these. I tried all 4 magnets as one came with each polish but none of them worked.,39,2
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"Problem wasn't with the polish itself, it was with the fact that the magnetic effects were not working at all. I tried everything so I am disappointed.",27,3
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,I recieved the package and they looked fine. I did not open the individual color boxes when I recieved it since it was a gift for my niece.

The others worked great I just wish that the other one wasn't broken.,67,4

I tried two different colors and not only does the magnet not work, the polish is clumpy- like it has sand in it or something- so it can't be used as regular polish either.

I tried them on my nails ( I work at nails salon and I know how to use that), the problem is all of the gel polish got really bad quality, seem they had sands inside and can't work at all, especially the silver and gold one. I will never buy it anymore. Bad and bad",63,9

All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,4.0,positive,Beautiful colors. The cat eye doesn't seem to be as prominent as the picture on the box but it may be just me. I'll practice more. Update: after a while the polish and brush went bad on 2 out of 4. I kept them in the original box all the time so it wasn't light that was cutting them.,59,14
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"I purchased...came quickly. Two of the products look as if they had been previously opened, the red lid was gooped up and the gold was dried out. I give 2 stars, one for each good product, the blue and silver.",40,15
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,2.0,negative,"I bought these solely for the star shaped magnet. I found it to be very weak and it barely shows up on the polish. I'm going to try to strengthen it by rubbing a stronger magnet on it to see if I can get the desired results. Still holding out hope on that. I cant give this any more stars because of how crappy the gel polish quality is. Its lose, runny, and it pulls away from the nail horribly. By the time I was done applying it, the nails that had been sitting had to be retouched before curing that I eventually had to do the same hand twice before curing. And I STILL had bare spots. The formula is subpar! The only way to get around this is to cure each finger separately, which would end up being more time consuming. I don't recommend this for people who want to have a salon quality manicure. So on top of the bare spots, I cant even see the start mark. I cant wait to scrape this off my nails!",180,16
All_Beauty,B01CT1W6U4,5.0,positive,"Initially I ordered this product and received a duplicate colour (ie: blue, red and two silvers instead of gold and silver). However, customer service was very helpful and corrected the issue so that in the end I received all four colours. I have used the blue, red and silver and the magnetic pattern so far shows up best on the red and blue but the silver is still a nice dark, slate colour. I haven't tried the gold yet but generally I like the Sensationail Brand a lot.",88,17

By my estimate, having paid around $15 for the thing, this is a $60/hour toy, as you would need four of them to last a full hour.

As an aside, I'm a little annoyed at the fancy ""boutique"" pet shop that sold it to me. It's one thing if I picked it up at Kmart or some other discount store where I would never expect the person who rings up the sale to alert me to the fact that I was buying a piece of crap...but in this case, I think it's incumbent upon the owner/operator who actually asked me what kind of dog we had, to be candid about just how delicate this item is.

I wasn't paying much attention and he chewed the end of the tongue off in less than 60 seconds.  So it does not hold up in any way against a chewer, so I moved it to an outside toy.  We've already had many hours of fun with fetch and tug-o-war.  I totally recommend this product!

I've had the more elaborate barrier that had bars but that one tended to always come loose and then would rub on the seat or jiggle noisily. None of my dogs have jumped over the barrier and they seem content with the see-through design at the top so they can look out the front window. I do have a Golden Retriever, German Shepherd and a Springer Spaniel. The barrier may not deter a dog that is determined to ride shotgun. However, we also foster dogs and I bring the fosters along to the dog park. The two foster dogs that we have had since I purchased the Kurgo did not attempt to jump over it either.",157,40

It is easy to install and fits up against the seat so you do not loss any floor space as we did with several other barriers.

When the dogs ride the back seats have to be folded down.  They like to take turns leaning on the center console and  would slide forward when stopping.  She sometimes makes life uncomfortable for the Giant and he tries to escape to the front.  Not good, nor safe.

The metal bar barriers have legs with extenders from the floor to the roof, they would hit the glass of sunroof.  Those  seem to be semi-permanent.  Whether that is because take up to much room to store, or to hard to install and remove I do not know.  All don't buy decision makers for me.

When I discovered Kurgo pet barrier it seemed it would meet our needs, IT DOES!

This was critical to me, because my car, a Saab, has the ignition on the hump between the driver and passenger seats, and my dog had several times stepped on it and turned the car off as I was driving--a rather unnerving experience.

As soon as she saw the barrier, my dog didn't even try to wiggle through.  It sent a clear message, and she immediately lay down on the back seat and was quiet.

The barrier is cleverly designed and can also be used to keep a pet away from a child in a car seat, while simultaneously barring access to the front seat.  One caveat--the net across the top impedes my vision in the rearview mirror, so I'm planning to remove it. (It unfastens easily.)

my only complaint is the installation.  it was a pain and difficult to understand and i'm not sure if it's installed correctly.  instead of hooks for the bottom straps they should have just provided straps you could wrap around the bottom of your seat.  other then that, it's not as tall as i had expected/hoped.  my dog sits tall and can still rest his head on my shoulder while i drive, but at least he's contained to the back seat.",145,67

This fit our puppy perfectly, and though she pulled hard to twist around in an attempt to chew on the leash (and managed to reach it, too!) it didn't unfasten.

I have purchased a number of these vests to help with kitten and cat training and the tabs that go around the body of the animal were always soft so as not to irritate.  That is not the case with the extra large size - the tabs are too short and the Velcro is very stiff and is squared off and will irritate the animal as it moves.  I am going to see if I can fix this as the soft mesh material is wonderful.  I'm glad I didn't buy more.  Returning it would have been a hassle. Too bad.,110,188

Its still a bit tight so I wouldn't get this for an animal any larger than 6lb.

Hopefully that won't be the case of me loosing him,70,218
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,2.0,negative,I love the idea but the way this thing is designed puts the front of the harness around the animals neck. In order for them to not slip out it needs to be a little tighter too. Felt like I was choking my animal. I wouldn't recommend this design.,49,219
Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,4.0,positive,"The company that shipped the product was professional and cared a lot about customer service. The product itself was well made, and it did its job well enough. My problem is with how it was designed. The product is supposedly designed to fit both ferrets and rabbits, but I found it to fit my rabbit very uncomfortably.

I had the adjustable neck strap as tight as i could get it, while I had the adjustable torso strap as loose as I could have it. It was still too tight around my rabbit's torso and loose enough around her neck that she was able to squeeze out of it a little at one point. I think it leans a little towards fitting ferrets, rather than a rabbit. I thought that the adjustable strap would make it possible for my rabbit to grow into a little bit, but she completely grew out of it in a week because of how tight the torso strap was to begin with.

If you have a ferret, it is probably a great fit. With rabbits, I suggest waiting until they reach their full maturity before getting one.",191,220

Pet_Supplies,B000HG733Y,5.0,positive,"I bought this for a small female Lionhead rabbit (whos always naturally been very slender).  Shes small for an adult female, even her dewlap is smaller than a typical female rabbit.  I went to the petstore and looked at the ""large"" size.  Its too small for a rabbit (unless you have a very small breed).  Even the XL would be too tight on a larger breed.  If you want one for a larger/heavier rabbit, I recommend looking elsewhere OR simply sew on more Velcro to the straps (it works great and still keeps them secure!).

For my rabbit though, this is a great harness!  The material seems strong and has a little stretch in it for comfort.  I was worried about the neckline, but she didn't have a problem with it.  It didn't constrict her.  The slip around strap on the neckline gives me added security.  She hopped around quite happily.  The leash is short though (just pick up a longer one at the petstore or the dollar store).  I cant imagine her being able to slip out of this harness.  I couldn't beat the price or the quality.

If you have a large breed you may want to consider buying it in person at a store for easy return if it doesn't fit.  It does run very small.  But it is a very nice harness.  Fairly easy to put on and he seems comfortable in it.  He has never managed to escape from it, but is a very calm bunny and doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  The leash isn't that long, but I feel like that gives me more control of the rabbit, though don't expect to be able to walk a bunny like you would a dog.

I have a mini rex, which is like a medium sized rabbit so It's good that it's adjustable, and it seems to be comfy for him.

It is too lightweight for that & will tip over---BUT my cats love it & we just keep it tipped over! They stand on it, lay on it or over it & hide things under it. They wrestle with it & scratch their chins on the edges of the bottom piece.  They love it & laying flat there is no problem with them scratching the heck out of it.  So it may not appear to be as sturdy as a wooden stand up post, but if you are creative (actually the cats tipped it the way they wanted it) & just tip it on its side, it works great.  I would buy another. The carpet is a very tight knit indoor-outdoor type carpet & does not fray like the stand up rug posts.

The best quality made and my cat barely touches it. He loves this one. It is not heavy and is best wedged between something or under something so it gives them a sturdy hold when they scratch. I love the raised curved edge as I prop it beneath a chair and it's the perfect length so it fits secure and my cat can stand lengthwise if he pleases on all 4's to scratch.

I also recommend telling them 'no, that's not your toy', and then giving them one of they're toys that they're allowed to chew on and say 'chew on your toy' to help redirect that behavior. It's natural for dogs and especially teething puppies to want to chew on things and they need to have something they can chew on, but this spray really helps to let them know what they can't touch. It's really powerful stuff, definitely hold your breath when spraying it (a mask would probably be better) because if you breathe it in while it's airborne it will linger in your mouth and it tastes HORRIBLE!!",142,6

Well, this stuff arrived and I figured I should test how good it is - or rather how bad it tastes? Both pets generally take anything from my hand that I offer and then spit it out if they don't like it so for my test I tried a plain old scrap of paper. Sprayed some of this on and gave it to the shih tzu. He ate it and then asked for more. Then did this with the pig as well. Same result. They both sat there and looked even hungrier like when was I going to give them another scrap of paper covered with this stuff. I repeated the process once more to be sure.

The first day I attached it to my table, it got used on a matted doodle, and a big golden retriever with lots of tangled undercoat.
The doodle blew out very easily with the help of this and a good slicker, so did that golden, it was very easy to attach to my table and dryer hose (my one complaint is that the hose clip squeezes my hose really hard, would probably bend it if you left it on there awhile,)

I didn't want to pay the outrageous $40 for the good stuff, so I figured I'd give this a shot. I have one dog who is about 15 lbs, and another who is about 35-40 lbs. So I got this to use with both of them. It was amazing. Within a day, if not hours, all the fleas were GONE, from my pets, my house, my bed (thank god!) and the product actually smells pretty good. An orangish, citrus smell. My dogs don't like when it's applied but I think thats because they don't like the squeezing noise when you apply it. overall, great product.

WAY more interesting than just having a book or a cassette.  I would hardly call it ""immersion,"" however, unless they sent several Spanish-speaking people to your house along with the program!

Instant Immersion is not immersion, it's mostly memorization (more so than Rosetta Stone). This is not a product you could really learn the language from. I'd say it's best use is for a student in a low level Spanish class to get a little more practice.

Also some of the speakers seem to have trouble pronouncing words and gain a really weird lisp. for instance ""azul"" becomes ""athththul"" or ""azcar"" becomes ""ah-ffffu-cah"".

overall: this product works okay as practice if you are taking or have taken some other Spanish class. you almost certainly will not learn Spanish from it, at least alone. then again it would be hard to learn it solely from Rosetta stone, so at least this is cheaper.",173,51

This product compares to Rosetta Stone in the way that a fast food hamburger compares to a well-prepared steak.  This is really nothing more than a mildly-interactive vocabulary list.  Perhaps that's worth the money, but don't confuse it with the advanced learning procedures from Rosetta Stone.  My problem with RS is that they do not show you enough direct translation vocabulary.  So in that sense, this would be a nice complement to RS.  The audio CD's included in this are actual lessons, thus not really helpful for drilling and memorizing.  It's really not comparable to RS at all, and any comparison is incredibly unfair.  They should take those claims off of their packaging.

It is because ""Rosetta Stone"" is so much better than the ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" Program.

I am a Spanish and ESL teacher. I have used both programs. Rosetta Stone uses a cohersive lesson progression that immerses you in the language by flashing hundreds of pictures in your face. You will be fluent in any language after using Rosetta Stone.

However, this ""Instant Spanish Immersion"" program does not use immersion. It teaches you vocabulary after showing you pictures that have barely anything to do with each other. You can quickly progress through the CDs without learning any grammar. How can someone be immersed into a language without complete sentences?

Well after you waist $40.00 on this product and try ROSETTA STONE you'll find out what I am talking about.

Level 1 in Rosetta Stone will teach you more about the Spanish language than a few CD's in this cheep program. Why do I need 3 CD's to teach me the numbers 1 through 20? That's rediculous! Not even my four year old is interested in the program.

* It is easy to use.
* There is not much guidance about how to use it, but not much would be necessary. (Since you are being ""immersed,"" it's the same as if you were simply left in a Spanish-speaking country, and you gradually grow in ability as you work through the CD's from level to level.)
* It does keep track of your progress as you learn, thus raising the bar gradually as you become better at Spanish.
* For the price, it is an excellent program.

Software,B001RYFYYK,2.0,negative,"The very first track that I tried to mapped out I found is incomplete and incorrect therefore I can only imagine the accuracy of this TOPO is suspicious.  Unfortunately Garmin has a stranglehold not only on the navigation instrument but also with the proprietary software and of course the maps software that you HAVE to own. You cannot use ANY other mapping software/product with the Garmin GPS. For the $129.95 PLUS tax, shipping and handling I think I have a reasonable expectation the Garmin TOPO would be accurate.  It is not.  My other complaint with the TOPO software is there are no instructions on use.  I guess the TOPO engineers expect new users to be intuitive or just learn by trial and error.  It is sad Garmin can't provide easy to use instructions in plain English.",136,40

It would be great if topo 24K worked, but with no manual and email support that doesn't seem to go anywhere I have nothing.

1st It doesn't want to install on any other drive then C: So have a lot of space available just to install it. 3 gigs+

2nd Once I enlarged the boot drive so that the software would load I tried to use it. Again, with no manual and NO help there's little one can do with it unless your into a treasure hunt. I think I got some maps on the Oregon 450T, but I'm not really sure. To delete the files the program says 'find the file you want to delete then delete it'. What file, whats the name of it? Where is it located? Oh I guess one just deletes files randomly until the correct one goes away, which ever that file is???",191,41
Software,B001RYFYYK,4.0,positive,"Auto routing yes. Universal single use mapping trails great, except Garmin chose brown elevation lines and brown city roads. In parts of San Francisco distinguishing streets from a high fill of elevation lines is not that feasible. As far as preparing to write to a Micro SD card a ""Core 2 Duo 6300"" took 6 hours to prepare a single 8 min write. ""Quad Core 9550"" more than 4 hours. More than twice the estimated displayed. Also firmware update for Etrex and 60CSX allowing a 4 gig card, not quite enough capacity for CA NA OR WA 24K. I made a special card part City Navigator NT part Topo 24k. City Navigator NT disables elevation lines when active.  California is two map files on NT (from map, hit menu, select setup map, check or uncheck NT map for your city needs). Topo 24K is a separate map file for a zillion USGS Quad maps. By the way, even the older City Navigator maps cover some roads in Death Vally that require experienced 4WD operators (Stripped Butte Valley Rd).",178,42

I specifically bought the 24K map version because it has routable trails.  The problem is that the map is missing a LOT of trails.  For example, in Mt Tam, Steep Ravine is not included.  Around Santa Cruz, all of the trails that make up the Skyline to the Sea trail are missing.  These are major, heavily used trails and having incomplete trail information really limits the functionality of the maps and the GPS unit for hikers.  I have heard that the 100K version includes all of these trails (albeit with less contour information).  I'm really pissed at Garmin and will probably be returning these maps.",126,43

I put it in a rino 530.  the only down side is it take about two to three minutes longer to start up.,89,45

Also, in Washington State near Shelton there is a campground known as Brown Creek. It shows this as being in the National Park! It is not! It is in the National Forest.. This is a big deal if you are a hunter! It is illegal to hunt in the Park but not in the Forest.  I have found many areas where the Olympic National Park is listed inaccurately.

Don't expect trails and such because that is not in this topo.  However, streets and navigation is, on units like the NUVI.  Even on the Vista, the contours are such that I can use them for ""bushwacking"" if necessary.  I compared this to the free one that a lot of people use and there is no comparision.  That one had no streets whatsoever in my area.  I would recommend it if you can afford the price.  I got an Amazon discount with a coupon.

The maps are clear and easy to read on my Garmin HCx Legend.  They're not cheap, but what can you do?  Sure you can look around online for free, compatible, download-able maps from online sources but I found I couldn't always get the coverage I needed from free maps.  Simply put, if you're going to be using your GPSr for anything outdoorsy, on the ground, in the western states of Washington Oregon, California or Nevada just suck it up and get these 24K TOPO maps.  Not the 50k:1 or 100k:1 ... Get the standard of the realm 24k:1 TOPO maps.  Then learn to actually READ a TOPO map if you don't know how.

Garmin provides two, free to download, guides for using a GPSr.  One specifically covers using your GPSr in conjunction with a paper TOPO map.  These are both good resources and are worth reading; especially if you're unfamiliar with the wealth of information a good TOPO map provides. Get them here:

How can these maps be trusted in areas one does not know? That is unless you don't mind being lost in the Forest.

Go to farm road CO123 (12 miles).
Turn right on I25 (43 miles)
... Arrive at home (123 miles 6.5 hours)

Amazon's price is much better than most others, but still very high compared to maps for GPS units from other manufacturers.

TuneUp is amazing for making your music library more presentable, which is great for iOS devices, because having artwork makes scrolling through your music so much better.

That being said, there's not enough new content in MapPoint 2010 to justify an upgrade if you have any earlier version of the software, unless you absolutely need the new features. The improvements on MapPoint 2010 as opposed to 2009 are relatively minor. Pushpin management has been overhauled, and you also have about 300 new pushpins to choose from. Map Settings has been cleaned up slightly allowing for a sleeker presentation. Also, you are now able to import / export .gpx files, making for easier data sharing. If you need new features like these then by all means, I would recommend purchasing MapPoint 2010.
If this is your first purchase of MapPoint, take advantage of the free trial download online, and also compare MapPoint's features to those of the cheaper Microsoft Streets & Trips 2010. Personally, that is what I use most often and it is perfectly suited for my individual needs.",182,10

What worries me considerably is that Microsoft has introduced what appears to be a very similar application - Bing Maps. This application is only available direct from Microsoft, and the cost varies with the number of seats you license.

That makes me wonder how long MapPoint will be available, and whether Bing Maps will be a better program.

In addition, other map companies like Google may already have similar applications or be about to release them.

I constantly have to get in touch with support(which is additional expense)to correct and reset the program to get rid of the bugs. I have talked to few accountants and they have told me that they have the same issue and one of them even told me that they would not work with that program any more. They have told me that 2011 in particular has a lot of problems.,134,59

It would be awesome if they could make an iphone app that would allow expenses to be entered on the go that would then wirelessly be entered on my office computer.  I must say that intuit is doing a much better job on the mac software than before.

The only area of great disappointed was related to online banking.  The Mac version does not have the capability to make online payments through your online banking system through Quickbooks for Mac.  This is a great feature with the Windows product.  No double entry, just key it once into the check register and send it to the bank for payment.
With Quickbooks for Mac, I have to double key the entry.  I key it once into the Quickbooks checking account register and then again into the online banking system.  When I download the statements from the bank Quickbooks for Mac recognizes the entry, for the most part, and matches them so I don't have to manually do it.

Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,The graphics and ease of use is much worse than Rosetta stone and not as much fun. It is easier to learn on Rosetta stone but you get what you pay for. this was cheap and can be a start...if you ever use it.,44,22
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"This language course is well worth the time and money for a totally useable way to learn Spanish.  It progresses intelligently through levels, and gives the student very practical conversation strategies.",31,23
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,Works well and came quickly. I just finished my Masters and should be working on my Spanish with this over the summer before I go to Spain.,27,24
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This product is worthless, providing nothing more than a few words and NO grammar. Don't waste your time on this one, folks. There may be products out there that actually can teach someone a foreign language, but this isn't one of them.",42,25
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"Arrived on or before time. So far i am just begining, i plan on seeing how far this program will get me when i travel and have to use it. So far it look like a good program. Not too expensive, if you put some effort into it .",49,26
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,This is a helpful product and I have shared with another person. Uses basic words to learn with pictures and audio talk as well.,24,27
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,This is a great way to learn Spanish. With this software and someone to practice with I am already well on my way to mastering the first couple of levels. My only wish is that they had more then just the three levels. I hope they will produce the next three levels soon.,53,28
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,I would give it zero but it does not work that way.  nothing worked it was a waste of money,20,29
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,The software is slow and I am working on a Mac less than a year old.  It continually stops working and shuts down.  Unless I received a lemon this software is worth less than the cheap price I paid.,39,30
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"YO no se nada Que paso amigo, The disks are very good and I will be using them more often",20,31
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"Purchased for my father who is 80 years old. The newest version of the software that I purchased elsewhere wouldn't work on his older Mac operating system, but this one did and he loves it!",35,32
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,I bought this to brush up on my Spanish which really needs a major overhaul.  Great for learning and plays on your PC.,23,33
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"Not sure where I went wrong, but this wasn't what I thought I was order.  I didn't send it back and its okay, but I don't use it as much.  I think I will eventually purchase something else, but it wasn't what I thought I was ordering.",47,34
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,It work really well. The shipping was fast .  This is exactly what i was looking for. im hoping to see how my son can learn spanish,27,35
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"I bought this program at Costco.  My computer doesn't have a dvd drive, so I downloaded the software.  I think I did, but I guess I won't find out because when I attempted to activate the program, it will not accept it's own key!  Guess it'll be going back to Costco.  From this idiocy to reading these reviews after the fact, I guess I shouldn't have bought the program in the first place.",73,36
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This review may be a little premature since I have only used it once so far but I am very impressed! I have used the Rosetta version and love it, but lost the cd so could not reload the program after I got rid of my old computer. I did not want to pay that price again so decided to try this one. It works wonderful and is fun to use. One disappointment and I knew this before I chose to buy it is that this is Spain spanish and not the latin america that we are more used to in the states.",103,37
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,This is so frustrating! I have a macbook air and so I am spoiled and am not used to having programs crash. I have not gotten past the third screen to see if the learning program is good or not.  Seriously so aggravating!,43,38
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This is a great way to get started with a new language!

I use the CD at I go to and from work. That keeps the words fresh in my mind. The repetition of going through the CD multiple times also helps in retaining conjugation info, which is the most difficult for me to retain.

The lessons on the DVD are very good and allow you to go at your own pace and repeat as needed.",76,39
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,My computer whiz son-in-law had trouble loading this program for my granddaughter.  We were all disappointed that it wasn't a bid more user friendly.,24,40
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,This was a great holiday gift for my wife as she's always saying what an awful teacher I have been. Great for the price and easy to follow,28,41
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"some fun games and stuff, you would do much better downloading a language app on your phone, or even better, making friends with spanish speakers. The best way to learn is to immerse yourself, listen to spanish music, watch spanish TV and go visit and make friends with Latinos, They will warmly welcome you and be glad to help a gringo out!!",62,42
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,I bought this for my son at Christmas.  It's a very well put together program.  It beats the leader by a country mile for a fraction of the cost.  Highly recommended.,31,43
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This product is terrible! Do not buy! It is decent only for a review of certain vocabulary words, but wouldn't actually aid in teaching one how to speak Spanish. I bought it because it seemed like a great purchase for the price. I guess you get what you pay for...",50,44
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"This application requires that my machine have a CD ROM / DVD Drive.  I have a USB CD ROM Drive, but the application does not install on my laptop, it runs directly from the CD ROM.  Can you say ""1995""??

I have no idea how good an application this is yet.  But I do know that if a CD ROM is required every time I run it that I will not use it.

So in case publishers have not heard, most mainstream laptops do not have built in CD ROM Drives anymore.  Requiring a drive to install is understandable.  Requiring a drive to run the app is not OK and has not been for several years now.",117,45
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,not that great.  simple and probably not what i would recommend to any one else wanting to pick up the language quick.,22,46
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"Full of grammar explaination, makes listener get bored and couldn't follow from the first 15min. Too much grammar for a CD language",22,47
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,I needed to find a way to brush up on my Spanish but do not have time to retake the fundamentals in a classroom setting. This product does the trick! thankx Amazon!,32,48
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"Bought this program to learn Spanish.  It give you a lot of material at the fraction of what Rosetta Stone charges.  The only problem I have with so much material to use is where to start.  For others this might not be a problem.  There are suggestions but not real lesson plans to follow.  I like it when ""tell you"" where to start and walk you through the course to the very end.  Not a deal killer but something I personally would like.  All in all, very impressed with the quality and quantity of this package.",96,49
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,the discs are very helpful and i am glad that i ordered as i will use this in my practice..,20,50
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,So far I like this it's easy to use and compliments my introductory to Spanish class. I would reccommend this for beginners it's well worth the money. It's colorful and gives you picyures to guide you along the way.,39,51
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This product has been really helpful. Couple of notes: 1) It's Spain Spanish so be careful with pronunciation, and 2) the layout reminds me of old '90s cd-roms. It works and it really helps. It not flashy and I'm okay with that.",42,52
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"This is awesome if you don't have that much time for studying. Like all learning cds, it takes the commitment of the buyer and I don't have that. If you are bent on learning though, this is perfect and it doesn't burn your pockets like other learning materials do.",49,53
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"Great couple of games to help learning, but cumbersome to load on a mobile device would recommend more games to aid in learning",23,54
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"As with every other discipline, there's no ""magic pill"".  That being said, there is so much to choose from in this package that if you are willing to put the time and effort in, it's a great program.",38,55
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,I am still working with this but found it easy to install and follow.  I am looking forward to using it more.,22,56

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"Not at all intimidating and super easy to work with.
I'm learning Spanish side by side with my eight-year-old daughter, so this really is for everyone.
We love the ""well done"" announcements when we get things right.
I'm now motivated to buy the French version.",45,58
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"This is nothing like Rosestta Stone, as it claims, much harder to follow and use, I was very very disappointed with this product. Wish I would have never sent back my Rosetta stone when I seen this product claiming to be as good for a whole lot less money, but now I know why it sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",56,59
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,Was not what I expected. It does not deliver. Extremely repetitive and the graphics on this is that of a children's game from the 1990's. I was so disappointed in this program.,32,60
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,haven't used it yet so it is hard to review at this moment but I will get to it once I use it.,23,61
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,Came out of the gate with great intentions but just not my type of learning I guess. Might work better for others.,22,62
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"I'm from south Florida and am around Spanish all the time, so I just need more vocabulary and small sentence practice to get by. I got the 16 cd course for your car. The first 8 CDs were pretty good. Then you heard Spanish people in different conversations. I got nothing out of the last 8 CDs. The speakers spoke so fast I could only understand a few words in each sentence. To their credit they did they did repeat the sentences, but this approach did nothing for me. I listened to the entire course 3 times, and still could not understand the speakers. What made it worse was that they spoke the sentence very slowly in English, but then said it so fast in Spanish that it actually makes you angry that they do it this way.",138,63
Software,B004M39SN6,2.0,negative,"This is basically usesless  and not worth the 20 bucks.  I tried it for about 10 minutes.  Go for Rosetta Stone, just spend the money, it's worth it.",28,64
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"After reading the reviews- I dove in.  I only got to play with the games/vocab level one for a couple hours one day- and couldn't believe how much of it I was remembering a couple weeks later.

Still got a long ways to go, but this is going to help with the vocabulary building for sure!",56,65
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,I am very happy with this product. I do not do the work needed but do listen to it often while driving and have improved my knowledge of spanish,29,66

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This software package is very easy to use, and offers ample opportunities to practice the language. As long as it is used often, just as with any language learning package, you will see your Spanish improve steadily. You should supplement it with a book that teachers grammar as well. I recommend ""See it and Say it in Spanish"".",58,69
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,I chose this product because of the price and the guarantee of how easy it was to learn.  So far I'm very pleased with the product.,26,70
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"I ordered this software program hoping that I would learn Spanish to supplement my teaching career.  Unfortunately, disk #1 did not work at all.  I followed the instructions how to download (included with the software) and neither of my two computers would start it. I even followed the ""auto play"" instructions included with the software, but alas, it would not start.  I tried other CDs on both of my computers to make sure it wasn't a computer problem and those CDs worked fine.  I tried the game disk, and it started, but there were no clear instructions how make the game GO and I gave up.  I sent this product back and will try a different program.",117,71

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"I was so disgustingly disappointed in this purchase. In the entire purchase, there was only 1 cd that actually worked. Do not waste ur money on this item. Save for the best version: Rosetta Stone. Lesson learned on my expense.
P.S.
I wouldn't have even rated this purchase with one star. Unfortunately, it doesn't let you post your review unless you rate it.",63,74

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"I had read numerous reviews on this program before I bought it.  I have had some formal training in the Spanish language for work.  I bought this package for the pure fact of listing to the cds while I am driving to work.  I have only listed to the first half or about 10 cds.  I have not utilized the DVD's nor the second half.  However, I wanted to let you know that you either need to write down the vocabulary and verbs so you can learn the words and listen to the cd again.  Or this package is great for a person that already has an understanding of the Spanish Language.  I think you get a lot of verb conjugation and word usage for the money out of this package and very easy to understand.  Good luck",138,79
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"This is an easy to use program, updates are easy to install, and it's a pretty simple program to use.",20,80
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,Does everything an individual needs for a spanish language language program. A fraction of a price of roseta stone. Great for High School Spanish.,24,81
Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,The cds provide half the work but the user still has to apply the dedication and consistency to actually learn the language. The cds are laid out in a simple format to allow quick learning.,35,82
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,I would put this product up there with Rosetta Stone and for the price might be even better. Wish there were more detailed directions on how mto get the most out of the program which is also my complaint with Rosetta Stone. As with both you have to use them consistently for best results.,54,83
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"if you're just looking for a TV type game, go for it. Otherwise a waste of money. Very disappointed. Get Rosetta Stone or sign up at the Community college.",29,84

Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,"I was sceptical at first, but this package definitely helped me improve my Spanish. Still a long way to go, but I feel like I got quite far without struggling. The box looked a bit cheesy, but I'm glad I gave it a try. Had a little trouble working it out at first, but worth sticking with.",57,86
Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,"Designed to look like Rosetta Stone but when you receive it clearly it is not.  The print in the description is so small that's it's difficult to discern this fact.  I suspect this was purposely done to dupe the unwitting.  Amazon will accept it's return but only after I paid the shipping back.

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,"Instant Immersion presents the Spanish language in an easy-to-learn manner.  The games reinforce the lessons. Students must achieve a certain number of ""points"" before going on to the next level.  My 10-year-old granddaughter loves it and has caught on quickly.  She did think it was funny that two of the words taught on Level 1 are ""wine"" and ""beer,"" but overall I feel teaches a wide variety of common words and phrases.  I've never tried Rosetta Stone, but Instant Immersion is way less expensive.  The set of Levels 1-3 cost me $30.",92,91

Software,B004M39SN6,5.0,positive,This was a really good buy. You can't go wrong for what it costs. You won't feel like you've wasted your money if you're not a real devoted learner. We just wanted something we could use when we have the time and ambition. Even if we only pick up a few common words and phrases it's still worth it. If you are more motivated this will keep you going. Adios!,70,95
Software,B004M39SN6,4.0,positive,Decent exercises but the vocab is random.  That's my only gripe because it should follow more set categories like textbooks.  If you're just looking for a supplementary lesson then this is great and definitely worth the $380 or so you save from Rosetta Stone.,44,96

It is easy to use and east to understand.",21,97

Software,B004M39SN6,1.0,negative,A real waste if money. There should be some type of manuel to help you with the program. I tried to place this in iTunes and it wouldn't work. This should be very intuitive to use and it's not. I hope Rosette Stone is better.,45,105

Nice chart showing how it compares and says even more benefits than Rosetta Stone, but wow this is a very slow, non-intriguing software.  Reminds of software from early days of computers.

Its fairly easy to learn and has a lot of great features.  Installation was easy as well, and ran with no difficulties, although it took about 20 minutes to complete.

I was most interested in the Live Screen Capture feature, but it was a bit difficult to find.  Users are required to look for it in Program files and manually make a shortcut in order to access it.  Despite that small flaw, Live Screen Capture works well most of the time.  For instance, it will capture video from MineCraft flawlessly, but I've had issues trying to get it to screen capture some other video games.

That's what I thought After the fiasco of trying to get help for the problems I had with Studio 17 and being charged to get support, I just gave up. There are so many other programs out there that are far superior than Pinnacle Systems. I would suggest going to your local Best Buy or similar store where you can speak to someone in person (no charge) to compare programs to your needs.

I work in the news media and have literally thousands and thousands of media files on my computer and no, I do not need to get bogged down in every file I ever processed each time I want to create something new. The learning curve is steep on this - the user interface is not particularly intuitive or user friendly.
And as others have noted, be sure to check that your computer meets the minimum system requirements or your experience will prove even more frustrating.

With Pinnacle Studio I am able to perform many more automatic adjustments than Abode, more scene transitions, and I'm able to tweak my videos in ways I never could before.  So far I'm really enjoying this software.  After 3 weeks I'm still discovering more that it can do!

Some people noted the difficult installation.  I wouldn't call it difficult.  I would call it time consuming.  But this I expect with any professional level video editing software.

It does show the track that we walked, but the topographic information from this software is so coarse that you can't tell that we went up and down, gaining some 500 feet in elevation since the contour lines are so far apart on the map generated. Furthermore, the road into the park wasn't drawn correctly, the ranger station and other services weren't marked and so on.

Also, some of the data is out of date for those remote roads.  I've found a couple so far that are listed as roads, but have been converted to hiking trails, or reverted to elk trails, many years ago.

The limit is that newer roads don't show up.  It also doesn't support auto-routing, even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn't suited for it.

The product support could be better.  Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you don't have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones.  The company's web site doesn't give a good explanation of what the software can and can't do.

Software,B00004Z0C8,5.0,positive,"I wasn't sure what I was getting when I purchased this TOPO Package, but am very pleased. It is a great addition to the tools that GeoCachers use with plenty of detail. I was also surprised that many of the better known trails (especially in state and national parks) are marked on the maps. However, it's easy to get spoiled by that and I find myself wishing more of the trails were marked.

I still feel that this software will exceed most people's expectations. My state of Virginia takes up about 36MB of storage on my GPS, so to store a whole lot you'll need a GPS with a lot of room. I loaded mine with just the areas I frequent the most, and any planned GeoCaching areas as the need arises.

Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,"It wasn't easy, but I finally got my US Topo software installed so I don't have to mess with the CD's.  Garmin needs to get on the ball and make this the standard install.  Basically, you need to create a folder on your hard drive and then copy all the files from disk one into this folder.  Using the ""Copy"" command from the drop down menu won't work, so you have to work around this issue. On the second and third CD, you will create subdirectories in the folder you created called ""East"", ""Alaska"", and ""Hawaii"". Once done (it will take a while), do the setup command from the folder you created on your hard drive.

I had called Customer Support for a little assistance with this issue and after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes, I discovered that the Customer support at Garmin SUCKS! I love the GPS, I love the software, but the customer support is a total waste of time.

If you don't need the terrain detail of the 24K series, give USA Topo a try first.

The one thing I am disappointed with is the program's insistence of having the CD in the drive to work.  This is quite annoying.  MapSource City Select and USA Topo 24K both allow you to install all the map files to your heard drive.  USA Topo should too.",129,47

This is the only product that will let you upload detailed maps to your Garmin unit, other software claims to work with your Garmin GPS, but they only download/upload waypoints. This software is way overpriced; it runs off the CD-ROM so it is very slow when accessing higher detailed maps. I tried copying the CD's to my drive and installing from there and it would not work. When pulling waypoints/routes/tracks from the GPS unit Mapsource always opens up a new map document, you can't import into the map you have open without copying and pasting. This is probably the most overpriced, counter intuitive and non-user friendly software created since MS Office.

Software,B00004Z0C8,4.0,positive,"This product is what it is. It isn't a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it. It is a basic set of TOPO maps that shows most local roads. What do you want for under $100 for a set of maps that covers the entire USA? It doesn't have every street name, the water maps are a little sparce, and some of the feature names are dated. I bought, I like it, I use it for what it is good for.

Bottom line is that this is a tool like any other. You wouldn't build a car engine with nothing but a $5 pair of pliers but you could. You can mow your entire lawn with a $29 string trimer but you wouldn't. This is a basic $100 set of maps of the entire united states, for the price you can't beat the detail.

The trail detail is that it will give you a point! I hope at least the trail is crossing it! I am used to the usual line to mark the way of the trail and not a point (Maybe its a vertical trail straight up?) I hate the map, I still like the GPS.

But one use I've found is this...some points of interest are not in the GPS V base map, nor are they in the V's City Select software.  So I simultaneously load the TOPO software, and presto, I can pick out the TOPO's points of interest...set a waypoint up...then route to it via the City Select map.
It works fine, that is unless you're finding a place which doens't have a road, but for driving to trail heads, and other TOPO type features, it's helped me.

It worked as well on the GPS as it did on my PC, and again I have no hesitation in recommending it.
Perfect accuracy is no more possible with this product than it is with United States Geological Survey topographical maps or other navigation aids, so those with unrealistic expectations of perfection will be disappointed.

Using a real topo map it is immediately obvious that these same roads do not dissapear and in fact continue on their course uninteruppted like a road should.

Purchasing Garmin software used is a pointless exercise in disappointment.  If you're going to buy them, you need to buy them new.

Three is close, and as far back as I am willing to go, although you cannot extract images which is one of my favorite ways to create pages.
In four, you can create JPEGS as well as PDF's of your pages and the whole program itself is more intuitive. It took me all of a half hour before I had my first page done. Showing people the ropes of the software (I gave version four as a Christmas gift to a few people) took all of ten minutes before they were on their way to making beautiful pages of their own.

You can get a copy of four for about 20.00 more than this version and I feel it it well worth it. Many pages I have done, people think were done with 400.00 photoshop.

I've clicked on everything their non interactive instructions suggest.  No luck. (Even the tutorial is non-interactive). Additionally, pages cannot be rearranged once completed unless one goes through the process of copy and paste.  Further, each project is limited to 10 pages so to create a hundred page album one needs 10 projects.  The help section is also very basic.

It is too bad that the templates supplied with this program are so cutesy and schmaltzy, and that more background ""paper"" isn't supplied.

I travel extensively in my job and having the GPS feature makes finding where I'm going very easy.

There are some inaccuracies with the POI's as others have stated, but they aren't so far off that you couldn't find them with a little looking around. At least with them marked on the maps you get a very good idea where they are.

Web based maps are good to have, but when you have to travel to several locations in a day its impossible for me to get online to find where I'm going. With this in my vehicle I can get where I'm going anywhere in the country with just a little typing and a few mouse clicks.

This will eliminate a number of instances where I have used the voice commands to obtain this information.  The number of trail points is now settable which can clear the map and reduce the load on the computer.  There is a new version of the Microsoft speech recognition software.

Others have had this same problem, as related on the Delorme forum, so it isn't just my computer, or my installation technique. Every other Delorme product I have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem.

I have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply (after five days). On their forum I was told to follow the instructions for a so-called ""clean install,"" but when I followed them (three times!) I got the same result.

Microsoft's product is static, or ""dead"".  Connected to a GPS, it will show you where you are... but don't expect it to think ahead.  I've used it numerous times and it had been helpful because its an accurate MAP and shows where you are, but that's it. There is a lot more to giving someone good directions than just saying ""This is where you are"". You want to know when to get ready to turn up ahead, so you can prepare for it.

- User interface is not intuitive at all; ambiguous commands, poor screen/button layout.

I'm trying to be patient and tough it out, but frankly I would not buy it knowing what I know now.  I also have Msft Streets & Trips, and although it has limitations as a navigation tool, the U/I is much easier to use, no problems with installation, and the data is far more complete.",117,5

Microsoft's version doesn't seem to offer this.  At least they don't mention it.  By allowing me to choose my own roads, I can avoid rush hour roads that are not ideal even though they are the calculated ones.

The user interface is much easier than in 2004 (and in 2004 it was EASY, and I mean super-EASY).  You can install the entire continental United States and fit it comfortably on your hard drive and map out a trip from one end of the country to the other and get there without getting lost.  For those techie people like me who get lost all the time, this program is like a godsend.

The reason I bought the 2005 version even though it is now 2009 is because it installs and runs easily in through Wine in linux (including USB/serial GPS  support!).

Newer versions (tested up to 2008 as of this review) do not install and/or run well via Wine so this is really one of the best options for locally-stored, street-level navigation in linux.

If you want updated cartography and new, handy features, go with a newer version. All versions of Delorme Street Atlas have significantly improved upon the version they replace and they are well worth their price tag. However, if you want a street-level nav program for linux that doesn't require internet access and uses vector rather than raster maps, Delorme Street Atlas 2005 is your best bet.",157,11

It was so cumbersome and I wished that this problem is fixed in SA 2005.  However, SA 2005 has the same problem and it seems like DeLorme does not care about this problem at all.

If you are a user who uses different language setting on Windows, you should try Microsoft Streets & Trips instead of SA 2005.  SA 2005 has better GPS capability than MS S & T, however, my choice is S & T for this reason.

The fact is that while Delorme only covers major Canadian roads, Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2005 can generate detailed maps of Canadian streets just as what it can do about U.S. addresses. Microsoft's product can produce driving directions in Canada too, which Delorme cannot do.

The pictures will come out horrible until you send them to your computer then their ok. Their is only one game motoGP and that with the camera takes up all the memory (so unless u delete somthing you won't be able to add any more games). The menu screen is very slow to move.the colors are bad they are not that vivid and the backgrounds that it comes with it are dark and if you try to brighten the screen of the phone the picture turns almost white. The phone is very slow. I had to return my phone twice to fix the charger on the phone because it never charges and the camera it oftenly not detected.you have to put it in more than 4 times for both the charger or camera to work.

It is larger than same priced Samsung phone, and a small drop will kill the phone.  I had Samsung, Nokia, Sony, and Motorola phones for past 10 years or so.  By far this is the most fragile phone.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00009PGN0,1.0,negative,"I've been a T-Mobile customer for many years, but am very disappointed with my current phone-- the Motorola T720i (now called the T722i). My first complaint arose on my first call. The earpiece volume is very low even at maximum volume and some calls just have to be ended if they're being made in an environment with any background noise. Many other complaints followed. Most dealt with hardware quality. My 1st one had a flaw in the flip mechanism that caused the phone to think it was being flipped shut when it wasn't-- ending calls unexpectedly. The 1st and 2nd ones would routinely ""freeze up"" during calls. The signal strength meter indicated full strength and the call timer was still counting, but the person on the other end couldn't hear me anymore and was soon disconnected. This daily occurrence required me to contact T-Mobile and get a 3rd one of these phones, which I'm sorry to say still has the strange ""freeze"" problem. All 3 have had the maddeningly low volume as well. Resolution and variable light functionality on the camera attachment are horrible as well, as is the color-quality on the display in general. It just looks washed-out, almost black & white at times despite adjustments. The good news is that Customer Service is great at T-Mobile and they always replace the phone when I have problems.

The thing I am [upset] about is that you can't download new games, I have tried soo much and you still cant. The pixelation is somewhat OK its not all that great and the Camera doesn't show good quality pictures.
Overall this is a good phone, it has lots of nice features, lots of ring tones and more you can download including wallpapers. T-mobile customer service is great also but they need to expand their coverage area.
If you are looking for a phone to buy for just talking all the time then buy this one, because it does give good Battery life, I didn't have to recharge it for about 2 days and I was talking on the phone and I was on T-Zones all the time. Now that's a good .. battery life.

Great price for the package (color screen, flip, camera, free headset, very useable belt clip).  To go into detail, the color screen is good but not great.

The reception is 3 bars upstairs in my house and 2 bars downstairs.  Call quality is better than the previous phones I have owned (old sprint one, and motorola startac).  Changeable faceplates gives the phone a customizable touch.  Ring tones sound a bit fuzzy with the phone open it seems but when shut sound fine.  A very odd variety of ring tones as well.  To sum up:
Pros:
Customizable
Clear Quality of Calls
Variety of Ring Tones
Belt Clip
Voice Dialing

Color screen in darker settings
Lack of variety of actual background pictures.

It's a flip-open phone so you can fold it and it's a nice small size.  If you want a phone that is packed with state-of-the-art features in a small size phone then get this phone.
I would stay away from Nokia phones.  They aren't built up to the everyday use.  The phones are weak and cheaply made.

Is you don't and live close to a metro area then you are going to be ok. T-Mobiles coverage really needs to mature. If I go to far from Boise (Idaho), then I have problems. Pick Verizon if you can.

I have even been able to receive calls in concrete buildings, something other phones have not allowed.
The battery life is decent, and having dropped our home landline, most of our conversations are via cell.  I have been happy with the length of time between charges.  The handsfree is clear and I have had no complaints from callers on the other end about not being able to hear me.
Ringtones are distinctive; I also appreciate being able to have the phone on vibrate OR silent.  I've always been a huge fan of Nokia, but this certainly supercedes all my Nokia experiences.
The size and weight are great; the phone fits well (easy to talk into mouthpiece with ear in proper location); voice activated calls very handy - good voice recognition
Dislikes: phone screen touching face when talking
Camera pictures are really quite blurry and poor quality
Camera makes noise when turning off
Storage capacity for voice activated calling small

The t722i's screen isn't as nice and bright indoors as the s105, but it works much better in the bright sun (the s105 is difficult to see).  Text input is excellent with motorola's adaptive input.  Just type the #'s and a list of the possible words are listed at the bottom, most common listed first.

The reception is great.  It actually solved a reception problem at home--only three very specific locations get decent cellular reception but don't accommodate me (on top of my monitor, on the top of the bookcase & on the west window sill).  Using the cell phone at home was impossible until now.  With the Bluetooth headset that is no longer an issue I leave the cell phone in one of the prime locations and I'm set to chat.

I love the fold out microphone; I prefer to have the microphone closer to my mouth.  Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but I don't feel like I have to talk as loud for the other person to hear me with the microphone closer to my gab hole.  I really like the fact that closing the microphone turns off the headset allowing for the charge to last longer.

I've had no issues with the volume level, seems fine to me.  I hear everyone just fine.  I use the headset when walking the dog and occasionally the wind blowing across the microphone is an issue, but raising my hood solves that problem.

Essentially I bought this model because of the price.  The HS850 was a bit pricier, but if it truly is an improvement on this model I advise you to pick that one up instead of this one.  But if you're a penny pinching miser who likes the best toys this is definitely the one for you.",255,9

PERFORMANCE

In terms of overall performance.. this little device is amazing.  It works optimally when walking indoors or in the car.  It doesn't work well in windy situations (on a bike or walking in wind) or in really loud trucks.  My friends have bought these as well and I have no troubles hearing them on the bluetooth (although if they are in a loud car they can't hear me).

SAFETY

Honestly, I think they look kind of dorky -- but the safest device for driving I've seen.  Much handier then just a headseat. I put it on when I get in my car and never even have to touch my phone.  I can place and receive calls without fumbling for the phone or taking my eyes off the road.

I highly recommend bluetooth to anyone who phones and drives.

Motorola replaced it under warranty and I began using the new one.  Rather than carry it in my pcoket, I kept it in its caryring case in the glove box in my car.  This one lasted four months before the same piece broke.  This time, I was able to glue it back in and continue using the headset for another couple of months before it fell out somewhere in my car.

Pros:

Good design

Good battery life

Setup was easy and works fine

Noise cancelling is not very bad. I used it outdoors and while driving, the person on the other end was able to hear me ok

Cons:

The connectivity sometimes fades, i hear this sometimes from the person on the other end ""you are breaking up"". When i bring my phone closer it seems to work ok.

I have no clue why they have given a pouch for this thing(the black pouch). I find no use for it.

I haven't been able to increase or decrease the volume on the headset, i use the phone instead. It is kinda difficult to adjust the volume while you are talking.

Motorola has yet to drop the ball.  They have cross shipped me an HS850, to upgrade the replacement HS810.  They have never given me a hassle, and both my replacements have been shipped Fedex 2 day at NO charge to me.

I feel the true measure of a company is how they act when the problem is theirs, and Motorola is a gem.  I have had no problems with my Motorola cell phone.

The folding boom makes storing the headset easy and its instant connection to my phone couldn't be simpler. However, after only a month's use, the boom's hinge point cracked and a small piece of plastic fell out of it. The headset still works fine, but I'm reluctant to use it much for fear that the missing plastic chunk may make the boom loose or might allow it to break off entirely.

I'm also not entirely fond of this headset's pusling lights to indicate power and activity. They're very distracting when I'm in my car at night; I wear the headset on my right ear sometimes and I often catch sight of the ""power on"" pulse in the rear-view mirror. It draws my eyes briefly and is just annoying.

The headset's audio quality is acceptable but somewhat thin. Voices sound tinny sometimes and if the cell phone's experiencing any signal-quality problems, my headset has trouble maintaining an active audio channel. One big plus, however, is how easily the headset and phone pair up, and how quickly the headset reconnects to the phone at power-on. Once the initial pairing is complete, this headset's operation is a no-brainer.

I decided to try the lanyard over the last few days and it makes using the phone in the car Really convenient.

The first time it quit was on a rainy day when (this is my guess as to what happened) a drop of rain affected the microphone in which I could hear others, but they could not hear me.  I called Motorola for a Return Authorization, spent $5 to send it FedEx Ground to the company and in 2-3 weeks I received a new one.  After not having this convenience product for a few weeks, I used it and a crack appeared on the microphone portion within 3-4 weeks.  The rubber portion around the earpiece began to detach itself.  The product was still working so I kept using it.  Then the hinges went as it did before.  Although it was working, I called Motorola to find out why they've made such a poor quality product for which the retail value is around $100?

You can only reliably charge it three times.

When the battery runs out, you're supposed to shut it off, and plug it in. At this point, the light is supposed to come on until it's charged (about 2 hours). After the first three times, it won't come on. Won't charge. Motorola says ""Oh we're so sorry--we only have a 90 day warranty on that..."" Cingular is like ""Oh it's over 30 days...""

I purchased the Motorola HS810 bluetooth headset from my local Cingular shop for use on my LG PM327 phone by Sprint.  The first thing I noticed was a huge delay in sound.  There is a three second delay for me in what I say going to the phone.  The second (and most annoying) issue was that of echo.  The other caller complained about echo sounds even when I had the speaker turned down so low I could barely hear the caller and needed to ask them to repeat every other sentence.

I owned this device for three days and gave up.  My local shop will exchange it for a Jabra bluetooth device.  I'll be sure to review it, also.  Hopefully that review will be positive.

I'll reserve a review of my bluetooth phone until I find a headset that works well with it.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,"For using it with my Nokia 3650 and any other s60 phone, its great. The 810 is compatable with pretty much anything from what my studies show. This design ALSO is nice for a easy ""on and off"" function. Compaired to the 820, this is better.. the 820 doesnt have a flip open design so you cant easily turn it on, you need to push the button, which is annoying. I rather open the mic and it be ready for me.

For talking on the phone its great.. however for doing everything else.. listening to movies, music etc, this headset sucks.. sound levels are off, distorted and so making the wired headsets better.

However I do use my headset daily and well.. couldn't live without it. Also since mine came with a car charger too. Its PERFECT! The carrying case has never sliped on me either when I latch it to my belt. Comes with a neck strap too, but I never use it.

So if your looking for a nice device to rely on, this would be the one, never had any problems yet and hope I never will..

Now if only Motorola would make a better plug charger... hate this 3 pin one.. normally those will break sometime down the line it seems. Hope mine doesnt...",218,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,4.0,positive,"I've had my unit for a little over a week and I have been able to use it pretty extensively in that time.  So far it has been great.  I have paired it up with my V710 and it worked like a charm.  Sound quality is just as good as any wired headset I've used on either end.

The best thing for me is the ""cool"" factor it has.  I like the little blue LED light (which can be turned off on a per-call basis) because it doubles as a locating device when I drop it in my car.  It also matches nicely with my phone since they are both Motorola so it's all coordinated well.

My only gripe is that the unit is a little side-heavy and the over-the-ear ""hook"" doesn't really fit snugly over my ear.  It hasn't actually fallen off but it does feel like it might sometimes.  It might just be cause I have small ears but I think they could have made the spring a tad bit tighter.  I guess one advantage is that you almost don't even feel like anything is on your ear (which is great for the tender-eared people).

However - like Todd from Houston - after 3 months the plastic hinge where the boom mike flips out broke off.  I have one small piece holding it together and when that goes I'm sure mine will stop working as well. Sloppy design for such an awesome product.,67,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002F7I94,2.0,negative,"I bought this several months ago when I purchased a new Blackberry 7100. Although the sound quality is somewhat marginal I was quite happy with the design and willing to put up with lower sound quality for the compact wireless design. Unfortunately, after two weeks the plastic on the  inside of the boom mic started to break off. I noticed that simply opening the boom would catch part of the plastic on the hinge, causing the plastic to bend and eventually break. After a few more months all of the plastic on the inside of the boom was gone.  A couple of weeks later the unit stopped working completely.

As others have noted, the belt case clip is poorly designed and frequently slips off. I ""lost"" the headset several times. Once I had to run back into a theater and search under seats in the dark to find it.

The headset comes with a very compact charger, but not a car charger. I would often run the battery low and have to revert back to a good ole wired headset.

There is really no excuse for the quality and belt clip problems, especially with the high price of the unit. It is too bad too, because it really is a very nice design idea. Motorolla just needs to improve the quality of the sound and construction.",226,51

With the Motorola HS810, it synchs up and works like a dream.  The flip open boom to turn on and off is a wonderful feature.

The one problem I have with the phone and not the headset is that Voice Recognition dialing is not supported by the phone's OS.  One point to make is that the bluetooth connection between the phone and the headset takes about 5-7 seconds to connect.  The issue with this is that when the phone rings with an incoming call and you pick up the headset and extend the mouth piece, it may not connect in time to answer the call.  I have had this issue a few times.  I love the freedom of the wireless headset, but the sound quality is okay.  You can definitely hear some crackling or popping at times.  If you like to be unteathered but willing to sacrifice some sound quality then this is the headset.

It was always a task to get it around my ear quickly, and even then it did not feel secure, although it never did fall off.  My biggest problem with it was the belt clip, since it came off when I was walking and I lost the headset.

My problem is that the rubber earpiece fell apart.  It provides a cushion for your ear.  It would be easy to replace (it simply snaps on and off).  I called Motorola to order some (I figured a dozen would last me a year!)  I was told that they don't sell the earpiece separately.  Since it is in warranty the only way I can fix it is to ship it to them and they will then ship me a new one.  So, I have to go without it for about 2 weeks.  If the next earpiece lasts as long as the first one, I'll be without the headset 2 weeks out of 4 while it is being replaced!

While I have had great experience installing and using this device, that is not to say you will have the exact same experience when you try to use this headset with your Bluetooth phone.  So do ask around (or read reviews at Amazon or elsewhere on the Web) to find out the headset that is known to work well with your phone.

On the other hand to get it to work with the laptop, I had to go through a few number of hoops for the USB/Bluetooth dongle but also with the headset/XP2 setup.  In the end, the catch was that I could not use the XP2 drivers for the dongle (you must manually direct the program to use the included CD drivers) and that you need to specify in the sound options the use of bluetooth audio/ microphone, instead of your onboard sound card.  Once I got things up and running, there was no problem with audio/voice quality on either end using skype.  If you need more specific details, there are web sites decribing the setup.

Communicated with RS, Moto and VZ. all three told me it was Acura. Acura refers me to Handsfree Link, Verizon never gave them the phone for testing before moving this to production. (This is done with all other wireless companies). RS exchanged the phone in Sept. Oct. I find that it is not the car but the phone. VZ bluntly told me it is my problem, discuss it with RS. RS said discuss it with Moto. Moto states that they know there is a problem with the Bluetooth but do not know how to distribute the fix. No one will refund me the price of the phone that I bought outright and paid in excess of $400, because it is now over 30 days old. I travel nationwide and have the same reception problems in all parts of the country. My Qualcom from 1997 and My Nokia from 2001 perform better then this phone.

I don't have anything that can send Bluetooth signals anyway, so the fact that I had to buy a separate reader wasn't an issue.  I can send pictures and ringtones to and from the phone without Verizon charging me.  The only problem with MP3 ringtones is that you have to save them to the phones internal memory, so you have to chop them down and lower the quality to keep more than a few.  The transflash card itself is worth the extra cost of this phone.  I can grab pictures off the computer to use as wallpaper or as a contact ID, again for free.  The camera is more worthless than my VX6000 indoors, but outside it takes fairly decent pictures.

Bluetooth - 99% worthless.

Bluetooth has a bunch of different profiles, and this phone only supports a very small number of them.  Mostly for using the phone as a modem or with a wireless headset.

They gave me a third one, which also went dead, so they gave me a fourth phone this morning.  Always the same problem -- the screen says ""unable to charge"".  Verizon can't explain what that means, but it must be more than a problem with the battery or charger, because they keep giving me a new (or refurbished?) phone of this same model.

To much shock due to my ignorance, my phone was actually crippled by my carrier. (with the exception of blue tooth wireless headsets)

Anyway, I'm now on my 3rd phone and was upgraded to a motorola E815.  I was constantly experiencing problems of ""unable to charge"".  Well at least after many trips to Verizon Wireless, they at least took care of me. It's amazing how many people have the same problem w/motorola phones.  I noticed this while waiting at the tech support counter for my address book to be transferred.

Oh yeah, forget the 1.2 megapixel camera!  It's truly crappy and worthless.

Co-workers first impression of the phone is that it looks very cheap.

It's not all bad news however.  The phone has an additional memory slot for transflash card. This is a wonderful feature if your computer is capable of handling transflash cards.  You can basically transfer your pictures, videos and music files directly to you computer and vice versa at no additional monthly charge!

The phone periodically blacks out while you are doing the simplest things like browsing your contacts and photos, which brings me to my next point. The camera is absolutely horiffic in moderate to low light. To get a halfway decent picture, you must take photos outside in very good light. Also, transfering photos and videos to your computer is a big pain because Verizon crippled the Bluetooth functionality - only letting you use it for headsets. Now, you must buy a $40 TransFlash card or email them to your computer for $0.25/message. Its latest problem of many is that it won't let me delete or transfer pictures to my memory card, so I cant take anymore photos or even send them to anyone. This phone does not even deserve one star.

BUT, it keeps losing audio when you try to make a call - it's not a network issue, it connects okay, but neither party gets any sound. I ordered two phones, one was really bad so I exchanged it. Now the same s**t is happening with the other original and the replacement.

It is possible that this is a Verizon only issue, their store tech support is absolute garbage (although their telephone customer service people are models of polite helpfulness - go figure) and denied there was any problem because they couldn't reproduce it after a couple of test calls.

I give up. I just want a reliable phone to make PHONE CALLS but it doesn't exist. If you look at all phone reviews, at least 1 in 8 is very negative. No mfr has good quality control, and the development outpaces testing (just like Microsoft, the bane of my work life).

I have to try again and again to guess what the phone will pronounce them. Although the voice dial feature is ""non-specific person speech recognition"" so that we don't need to train the recognizor, why not also proivdes some method for the user to hear the target name pronounciation? In the other words, if the user cannot train the recognizer, why not let the recognizer train the user? I still have several friends which I don't know how my v710 will pronounce their names , so that I cannot call them by voice dial.

Another issue is about the life of the battery. It can only last two days after fully charged. Considering it has double color screens, I can somewhat accept this although it is really troublesome to charge the phone every two days.",206,23

-Incredible reception

-Crystal clear call quality

-1.2 megapixel camera w/flash

-Digital camcorder w/up to 3 minutes of video and sound

-Sleek,sexy ""executive""look..gotta love that black over silver!

-Good speaker phone

-Awesome voice recognition

-Rock solid construction

-Fully functional bluetooth(w/Alltel)

-Easy accessible menus

-Perfect sized,white lit ""smart""keypad...this thing actually senses ands turns off when there is enough light!

-Mp3 player and fm stereo headset

-Beautiful,double color display(internal/external) with a total of six different colors also featuring a huge bright,internal screen

-Tons of preloaded wallpaper and screen savers

-Too many features to name!!!!

Cons:

-Weak vibrate(I assume this is to preserve battery life)

-So so camera at night....in night mode,the camera takes mediocre pics even with the flash on. It takes forever to configure the right setting so my suggestion is read the manual and play around and see what you can come up with.

-A bit better than average battery life...rated @ 3 hours of talk time ...I highly recommend the extended life which lasts for about 5 1/2 hours.

-Surface scratches rather easily

-Instruction manual is a little bit confusing in some aspects

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,3.0,neutral,"I have owned this phone since December 2004.  While I do appreciate many of its features, this phone falls short on some very important basic functions:

1. Battery life, as mentioned by many, is terrible.

2. The flimsy plug-in phone charger (and where it connects into the phone) is quite testy - and I fear it is on its way to failing completely. When it DOES work? It takes FOREVER to charge.

3. Humidity severely affects this phone. If hands are even slightly damp/sweaty or it is humid outside (which is the case nearly all summer in NJ) - the display turns off.

4. This phone constantly turns itself all the way off - and the only way to get it to turn back on is to remove the battery, put it back in, and hold the power button for about 15 seconds.

5. Motorola's instruction booklet for this phone is possibly the worst I have ever seen.  Pathetic.

6. I do not get great reception with this phone. At all. (Now, this could be my carrier's fault... something that makes no sense - having one of the largest carrier's in the nation, living in the most densely populated state in the nation and receiving such horrible service.)

7. I do not want a ""refurbished"" USED phone when I go in for help.  Either fix the phone I have or give me a new one with no problems.  I do not want a phone that already has problems... because guaranteed, they haven't fixed the problem - they just cleaned it up and put it in a new box.

These few things are enough for me to want to throw this Motorola out the window and never look back. These are basic issues - and for the price?  The phone should work. Period.

My girlfriend has the newer one and her's wins hands down.  And to top it off, it is the same price on Verizon's website!

Verizon won't do anything for me since it is past the 15 day trial period, and from what I understand, they don't care if I am happy or not, just that they have me wrapped up in a 2 year plan with the sub-par phone!

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,5.0,positive,"I got this phone after having used both a Motorola V600 and V551 on Cingular.  It's better than both.  Verizon service in Los Angeles is much better than Cingular, for starters, but the V710 is better than the other phones too.  First, the screen is huge and bright.  Better than the others.  And like the V551, but unlike the V600, when using the phone with a bluetooth headset, the phone will ring (in addition to the headset), which is a huge plus.  The negatives: the keypad is lousy, the camera is lousy, the external disply does not show the time when not lit, and the phone is larger than the GSM models.  But those are all worthwhile sacrifices for better service.  And for all of the complaining about the crippled bluetooth, it isn't a big deal at all.  Using mobile phonetools you can still sync your phonebook with Outlook using bluetooth.  Bluetooth headsets also work great.  The only bluetooth ""loss"" is the ability to transfer ringtones.  Not such a big deal, if you ask me.  This phone has just been replaced by the Motorola e815.  For the price difference, I'd get the V710.  The newer one addresses all of the negatives mentioned, but at a ~$125 price premium, which just doesn't seem worth it.  And you loose analog in the new one, which only matters if you travel in the middle of nowhere often.  At the end of the day, if Verizon has the best service in your area, this phone is a steal at its current price.

Customer service is second to none!  I have to say that I have never been treated so well as a customer than by Verizonwireless.  For example, my wife and I updated our phones via phone.  The first person I talked to wasn't really helping.  So, the trick is, call back, it usually works. The next person was soo nice, she gave us the phones with an added discount,(...)for us she could, sent them overnight, and threw in an extra holster for each of us!  Admittedly, this was because the initial order had been stopped for some unknown reason.  So, to make up for it, the nice lady did all that. Now, if you have dealt with any kind of business in the last 20 yrs, you can count on one hand how many treat you well enough for you to remember, am I right?  Well, we all, they all, make mistakes.  Understanding that is the first step to becoming a much happier and more satisfied customer, wouldn't you agree?

-battery life with the factory battery blows! You'll get a day or two at most on a stock battery (my T68 would last almost a freaking week). The 1500mA extended battery will last 3-4 days which is a bit more acceptable but is bulkier than the factory unit (still fit in the holster though which is nice).

So if we were planning on using MP3 ring tones with Verizon, don't waste your money on this phone.

That being said, I'm sure the reason this ""high-end"" phone is now inexpensive is Verizon's miscalculation when they disabled most of the v710's Bluetooth capabilities.  Currently, there's a lawsuit pending against Verizon for this very reason.  I see Verizon is now giving away a free Bluetooth headset with the v710 to make you focus on what their Bluetooth will do, because it won't OBEX (object transfer) ...or much else.

A bit spotty for Mac OSX users

Verizon's software update further cripples phones usability (greedy bastages)

Pros:

Great sound (although you have to remember to keep the speaker over your ear). Truly great speakerphone- I've had friends have no idea that I was on a cell, much less a speakerphone. I think that between the speakerphone and the bluetooth headset, Moto actually almost meant for you NOT to use the handset in the conventional way

MP3's as ringtones are fun, but you have to work around Verizon to do it. (copy them to the optional transflash card from your computer, then to the phone)

Seems to have great signal strength, at least here in LA. I have very few drop-outs in areas that my old V8160 was really reaching for a signal.

Color screen is gorgeous inside, very nice outside.

Bluetooth headsets are a godsend! I can dial, talk, and hang up merely by touching my right ear.

General: Even with Verizon trying to wrestle the last quarter out of your pocket, it's a great phone. If you get one with the earlier software, you can get around Verizon by using the translash card and a card reader to transfer images and MP3's to and from your computer. I've heard that the later software removes some of that functionality. Which is why I am not flashing my phone.",296,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002W2H2K,1.0,negative,"I am extremely disappointed in this phone.  Only because of Verizon and how they have disabled the many features that this phone has to offer.  My boyfriend and I brought this phone roughly 30 days apart only to find that the software on his allowed him to download ringtones, pictures, etc. utilizing a transfash.  Well, I went out and purchased a transflash as well but quickly found out that I couldn't transfer the files to the new software that is now installed on my phone.  Bottom line is if you have the older software you can enjoy this V710 but if you have the newer software FORGET it.  I wish that as a consumer there is something that we can do about this misleading options on this phone.  I only wish I could return the phone.  I truly don't think that what Verizon has done is legal.  If anyone has figured out a way to get around their many disabled features, please let me know.",165,60

The software is the main problem. From not being able to select individual phonebook info from received/dialed calls to the default ""LOUD"" setting when plugged in, this phone has me pining for my old, non-camera LG. It even alerts me that I have a missed call *after* I've checked voicemail for that missed call (thanks!) - that is if I can feel the feeble vibration when set to ""vibrate"". And after a month, the phone feels like it's about to fall apart. I should have taken the hint from the keyboard on the display model which was completely destroyed. I bought this b/c of the tri-mode capabilities and it was the only one available at the time. If I've missed something in the directions and any of this needs to be corrected, I will gladly recind or edit this review. Until then, I'm stuck with my first and last Motorola.",180,66

The 4th time something wacky happened when I used it with my iBook and I did not disconnect it properly.  I went back and Verizon gave me a refurbished model (like the other 3 times).  This cell will not do any file transfering by BT so that is a huge downfall.  Its almost useless.

Since this was the only Verizon BT cell I bought it.  But in the end i wish I did not.  The cell got a huge hype and it was all for nothing.  Camera is useless as it takes sub-par pics.  I've seen Samsung's do better than this.  The screen however is nice and crisp.

I also noticed that the cell scuffs really bad at the high points (where it opens/closes) but there is nothing you can do about that since you gotta open and close it.  I think Motorola missed the mark on this model.

But be warned and alerted. The not so glowing reviews are probably the ones you should take as legitimate.

Now, onward to the phone review. I have owned about five or six cell phones over the past three years and the V710 is the worst. I was drawn to the rebates and low price, which basically got me in trouble from the get-go. The phone has terrible battery life, it is difficult to operate, it is clunky and large, the sound quality is poor, there are hardly any ringtones on it, and the button keys are flat and hard to press.

Basically i wanted a good phone that would always be available to use. It has excelled in all areas. 0 dropped calls, have yet to have 0 bars, battery can go several days without a charge and the speaker phone is the best i've ever seen.

Pros

Signal strength

Great sound quality

Superior speaker phone

Good battery

Hit ""contacts"", then hit the ""menu"" button, scroll down to ""setup"" click that, then hit ""view"", select ""primary contacts"", then hit ""done"". What do you know, people with more than one number are only listed once. This is what the little book that comes with the phone is for, read it!

As a phone, the V710 is amazing. We all knew about the crippled bluetooth when we bought it, thank Verizon for that. If you don't like it $175ETF and you are free to do what you want. You are not ""stuck"" with anything.

My battery will last 3-4 days with my normal useage, if your battery is that bad take it back to the store and get a new one.

The camera takes decent pictures for a PHONE! If you are using the picture on your phone change the resultion of the camera to 320x240. If you are going to put the photo on the computer use 1280x960, it will look good once you get it on the computer.

The video capture is also cool, as long as you don't move the camera too quickly while shooting. The screen is also worth pointing out. It is very very clear and bright, and huge too.

First, the user interface: It's ok. It is nice that it allows the ability to customize which options are displayed (and in what order they appear) on the""home page"" of the phone. Unfortunately that, along with the 1.2 megapixel camera, are the only good things I have found with this phone.

Second, the bluetooth: This phone does not allow copying items to/from the phone using a bluetooth compatible computer (and does not allow emailing of photos, so there is no way to get the photos to your computer!), AND there is no way to perform contact/address book sync with a computer or handheld device (pda). Also, no calendar sync.

Third, there is no way to have a single phonebook entry (person) containing multiple phone numbers! Each phone number occupies a line in the phone book, so needless to say, the phonebook list is WAY longer than it needs to be (very few people that I contact frequently have only 1 phone number... I think my grandma is the only person I know that has only 1 phone number)

It isn't a bad phone otherwise.. maybe I've just come to expect more from a cell phone (for example, my less expensive Sony Ericsson T610 had full bluetooth addressbook/calendar sync, a more neatly organized phonebook.. although took slightly lower quality pictures).

Haven't done much with the camera, but I'm starting to think that with the way most people treat their phones, how is the lens supposed to stay clean and not blur or otherwise hinder images? It may really only be good to have for impromptu photos.

Think about:

Are separate PDA and phone better, even if it means 2 devices instead of 1? The PDA vendors have more of a track record with hooking up to the PC.

Are separate camera and phone better for most pictures? The camera vendors that made film in addition to digital cameras have a history, and prices are plumetting, and megapixels and features rising.",253,96

It's ringer volume is Mediocre, Sprint and Nextel have a louder choice of phones. It's very small the same exact size of the V180, and there's nothing but an ugly poorly made leather pouch to put the little thing in. It's a beautiful phone to look at. But once you put it in the pouch (I bought from the T-Mobile store)it's no longer good looking... The menu is a bit confusing at first, but the battery life is good, picture quality is good, reception is good (no dropped calls).

One reviewer said they wished there were icons to designate home/cell/work/fax etc...but there are, when you add a contact you can choose what type of number it is, and in your phonebook, a little icon appears next to the number. The text messager is nice, you can easily send a single message to a bunch of people at once. I found that the volume level could be set VERY high, contrary to the other reviewer a few entries before me. I could hear it in my car with the music loud. The vibrator was also stronger than they made it out to be. There are many ringtones to choose from, from simple rings and sounds to more intricate songs. From t-mobile, you can also purchase a HiFi or Megatone ringtone, which are very clear and a bit more fun. It is small, and lightweight as well; Fits in my purse nicely. The backgrounds included with the phone aren't bad at all, I happen to like a few, but once again, you can download others online.

The exterior LCD on the V-180 cracked at some point while it was in my pocket, for what reason I have no clue. T-Mobile said that this is a ""known problem"" with these phones and offered a warranty repair in two weeks with no temporary replacement. No thanks. Two weeks without your only phone is a long time. So I payed $50 and got a new V-188. Motorola had clearly improved this phone with a beefier plastic housing around the exterior LCD. After 4 months, that cracked while in my pocket, but the LCD was in tact, so I guess the upgrade worked. Later on, I dropped the phone once and now I have intermittent reception--it will work fine for a while and then not for a while. Yeah I dropped it and all, but I had two cheap Nokia bar phones before this that I could fling across a parking lot without any damage.

Other than that, I do love the flip phone concept--it's light and smaller than most other phones and the interface is intutive. If you want a cool, cheap, little phone short on superflous featurees, I recommend it. Just make sure to treat it like fine china.

I realize this sounds impatient, but if you don't hold the button long enough, the phone will not turn on and you have to start all over again.

  It is also slow to switch from menu to menu, kind of like when you have a slow computer and you press a key and there is a delay until the computer responds.

  The phone also takes forever to reconnect service when I come out from a tunnel or subway. The wait is sometimes 30 seconds to a minute.

My previous phone, a V60, had a convenient external button for voice activated dialing and was built sturdier.  This one looks like if I drop it, it's done for.  And voice activated dialing requires you to hit two keys in succession, which is a bother.

The manual this phone comes with might as well be written in Urdu - it's that opaque - but you can find out how to use this thing by checking online forums.

There is one other caveat. If you want the iTunes software in the phone, the US version right now does not come with it and neither does the Euro version but apparently the Asian/Middle East version do ... huh? Yea - who knows what's going on.

I love this phone with a very few exceptions.

1. It didn't have AIM installed by default, I still don't have it because you need to use a PC proram to modify the phone to enable AIM and I use a Mac.

2. There are no BT profiles on the unit I purchased.

3. Since the phone hasn't been released in the US yet, Motorola won't give US owners support on the phone.

My second review on this product. I've purchased this phone last year and after a couple of month of using it I realized that it was not all that.  Actually, this phone was not very durable, even though it has an outer shell made of aluminum. This phone and other one (I bought two)just stopped working after 2-3 months, no falls or submerging in water, just stopped.  Maybe these two were lemons, but I don't think so.

The only thing that i don't like much is that the volume is not so loud, and if you are talking in a noisy place you may want it a little higher, and also be advised that this offer does not include the little memory card so you have to buy it separately.

While both looked the same, the V3i have a lot of added features that, for a while confused me. But after a week of tweaking, I finally came to love the added features and was happy with it.

While it's true that this phone is not MAC-friendly, I also found out that the Phone Tools software do not recognize it as an existing product of Motorola. Extra features aside, I got this phone because of the memory expandability that the V3 lacked. I'm one phone user who doesn't use whatever extras are stashed in to make a phone worthy of one's time... so long as I could make/receive calls; send/receive text messages, and listen to a bit of music. Internet access via the phone may be nice to some but not to me. That's just added expenses to my hefty monthly bill with AT&T.

To sum it up, this phone isn't the best there is out there but useful enough for my own needs. I'd buy another of this V3i, hands down (i.e., if I happen to have the extra cash to own a second unit). With Quadband frequencies-- it makes a good phone for travel outside America. Battery life is also a big plus. Some people could downplay this phone for what lacks but not me. :D",236,40

It has longer battery life than the V9 and has all the features that are necessary in a cell phone.

The durability of the V3i is also excellent. Cell phones with too many integrated electronics will be damaged easily. I had my first V3i crushed slightly by a car that drove too close to the curb. The front screen was slightly cracked, but the ballistic durability of the hard plastic is still surprising. The phone still worked perfectly. I then bought my second V3i, and fixed the old V3i. All the store had to do was replace the glass on the front screen and my old phone became as good as new again.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,3.0,neutral,"I have to give Motorola credit for the entire RAZR lineup, because it is definitely the coolest phone I've ever seen.

I love the exterior LCD screen.

And that's about it for likes.

The dislikes are numerous for me, because I own a Nokia 3650, which at the time was the best phone you could get (2003).  Now it's outdated, but here's some interesting points:
-my phone takes pictures of equal quality
-sound playback is equal to my phone
-I have unrestricted Java applet usage, including a MUCH larger library of available programs
-my sync manager does much more than Motorola's, including much better integration with Outlook
-my UI doesn't suck

I've had my cell phone for five years, which is an ETERNITY for cell phones, but it's still not out-featured by this phone.  I tried to get an eBook reader for a RAZR and all I could find were sites that basically make you compile a JAR file and unlock your phone to transfer it... where it may or may not run.

Contrast with my Nokia 3650: I downloaded a free eBook reader (Mobipocket) using Nokia's software (which can be downloaded for free from Nokia) and I was in business.  Vendor lock-in for cell phones is a big problem for me, and maybe it is for you, too.

This is a stylish phone that epitomizes form over function.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,4.0,positive,"My post is mainly for the bad review given by Giovanni.

I got my Razr v3i for my wife, and got it from ebay.

Mine is not defintely for American, but in any case, I do not have any problem with

1. isync, so no need to edit

  But I agree with ""denomalizing"", this is same as other moto phone.

2. No hard reset so far

3. itunes works with NO problem.  itunes' m4p also works.

  In fact, the only reason I bought this is itunes, but I have to add : sound quality is mediocre. (It doesn't matter with my wife, since she doesn't have keen ear).

  In ebay, there are some items - instructions to add itunes to this phone - at 10-30 dollars. I didn't try it yet and I didn't hear the success story. But it seems to me that it is possible to add, even if it only has moto's mp3 player.

So, basically, I do not have any (significant) problem and I did not pay $349. My complaint would be no regular headphone jack and no bluetooth ad2p profile.  I got the phone (ebay), 1gig transflash sd (amazon) and stereo headphone (from ebay) and three year warranty from ebay and in total, I paid $300. I don't think it is much cheaper than ipod nano + cheap phone, but it is very nice to have two in one piece.",235,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000E95OAI,5.0,positive,"I purchased this phone unlocked about two months ago.  I am not sure why it is not readily available in any US store.  There seems to be a lot of confusion out there about this phone.  The V3I is awesome.  Hands down the best cell phone device that I have EVER purchased.  The itunes capability is great, even though the song limit is 50, it works great as an ipod back up.  The sound is as good as you can expect and you can listen to your itunes songs over the speaker without having to use any headphones.  The best thing about this phone is the removable transflash card that can be used (up to 1gb) that can be used to store songs, use as a thumb drive, or whatever you would need a 1gb worth of space for. In addition, the one megapixel camera is a definite upgrade from the old V3.  Also, the video capability is awesome.  Unlike its predecessor's, the V3i will take as long of video as your memory will hold (three minutes, thirty minutes etc).  The looks and feel of this phone are amazing too.  The gunmetal look stands out among the sea of normal RAZR phones. Also, I love the front blue light, which you can program to flash differently for different things.  The only problem with the phone is the fact that you cannot purchase it at any United States phone dealers.  You either have to purchase it here or someplace like eBay. I purchased mine on eBay for about $250.  Go for this one, you won't be disappointed.",266,66

The speaker phone button is INSIDE the phone, there is no way of pushing it, plus you can not put any button on the side unless you are total clumsy.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EGT1S2,2.0,negative,"I liked this case at first, but the original enthusiasm waned as it got broken in under normal use.  Originally, the phone fit in the case with a secure snugness that held the phone in place regardless of whether the button was snapped or not.  Over a couple of months use the leather relaxed and I this was no longer the case.  The removable clip is a nice idea, but it makes the case very thick on your belt and leaves the case and the button to secure the phone in the case prone to snagging.  I found that the button would snag on the seat of my car or the seat belt and the loose nature of the case would allow the phone to drop out. Not good. The final death knell was when I had the case on my belt and it snagged on the seat belt as I was exiting my friends car.  The belt clip and button/anchor on the back of the case remained on my belt and the phone and leather case hit the ground. I guess I could Gorilla glue the parts back together, but that would only solve half of the problem.  In the past I have not been happy with the wrap-around (glove like) cases, but I need to protect my investment so I'll move there next.",225,0

It's one real shortcoming is the 4-position locking swivel clip which wears quickly, allowing the pouch to swivel freely. To me, a minor irritation.

I also recommend you buy three at a time, reason, the belt clip tears the leather rather easily (getting in/out of car) There cheap enough, but be careful, there are sellers that still charge you separate S&H on each order, despite the fact they send them together.

Design:
It looks aesthetically pleasing.. actually awesome!

The overseas model has a rubberized finish whereas the US model is metallic. This applies to both Black and Silver models.

Pairing:
It works fine with my Nokia 6230i. Just a breeze to start using it.. Just follow the quick steps in the manual.

Feel:
It has a solid feel.. The buttons are quite hard to press, infact so hard hat u have to use both ur hands to actually get a grip of them. I would suggest setting the volume to the max before using the headset.. The on/off button in the center works flawlessly and is not that hard to press.
The handset doesnt give a good grip over the ear and it feels like its gonna fall off. This is becasue of its ""over-the-ear"" design.

Quality:
The reception is great even when a few feet away. However, a wall or similar will cause a little disturbance / static.. Thats how bluetooth functions and is not a headset problem.

Pros:

The unit is solidly made and easy to setup. The mute function work well, the volume is good (no DSP) and sound quality matches my old Nokia. Unlike a lot of loop headsets, this doesn't seem like it'll break/fall off as I tend to put it in my pocket when unused.

Pairs fine with my Mac and you can turn off the blue light if needed. Charger is a small flip-prong type and reasonable at 2 hours to charge. Battery talk time is good although it's unclear what type of battery it has internally. The audio cues are fairly logical.

Volume button doesn't turn up or down normally even after we keep it pressed. Some time it works some time doesn't. I don know may be there is some technique to do it perfectly. I mean! When we are in conversation we want to increase or decrees volume with out taking off the headset. Anyway so far this is kind of -ve point for the headset.

Anyway, over all this is a great cool Bluetooth gadget. Have one - recomended :)",181,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,"Overall this works pretty good...it rarely gets ""confused"" like a lot of the headsets with only one button do. My main complaint is that the volume just isn't very loud...even turned up on max. And that makes it very hard to use in the car when you have a lot of road noise or rain, etc.",56,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,"I've had this headset for about a year now; I use it with a Razr.  It's a fine headset from a technical perspective: the sound is fine, it's easy to pair and use, etc.  I haven't run into any problems using it in a car, or out of doors.

However, it's really not very comfortable: the hook that goes over the ear is just a bit too stiff and edgy, I wouldn't want to wear it for a long call (more than 15-20min say).

For comfort and performance, consider the Plantronics Voyager 510 (around $50 at Amazon); I've had one of those (now used by my son), and it is excellent.  If you're into new gadgets, check out the Jawbone sets -- I haven't used one, but a colleague swears by the one he's been using for a couple of months.",141,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,I broke my other BT and was looking for a cheaper yet good alternative. I read some tech reviews and would agree that the call quality is pretty good. I haven't experienced any static or echos like some others have mentioned. My only big complaint is the buttons are hard to access. The volume buttons ar on the top and bottom like my old unit but these one are set in some. That makes it hard for pressing them if you have larger sized fingers (like myself simply being a guy). The other button is the call/function button that is the back panel you see in the photos. It is difficult because it is towards the back instead of the center(like it should be)resulting in the earpiece tilting off of your ear when having to push it. It also is a firm button which I doubt loosens up after more use. I'm not going to complain anymore though because for the price it's a reasonable BT.,166,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,"I bought the H3 after losing my Motorola H500.  I found that the range is terrible.  I know bluetooth headsets don't have great range but I get static on this one if I turn my head for crying out loud.  If I have my phone in my pocket it has to be in the pocket on the same side of my body as the headset to avoid terrible static.  Also, it really hurt my ear to wear it at first.  I guess I suffered through it and am now used to it, but it hurt a lot at first.  I just doesn't have the same rubber cushioning as the others. I should have just bought another H500.",117,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,"Got the H3 two months ago, paid $9 more than today's price.  It's a decent unit, but there are some drawbacks.  The earhook doesn't make for a secure fit to your ear, but that's an issue for most BT headsets.  Sometimes my H3 won't boot on the first key press after a recharge or sitting in a warm car for a few hours.  Occasionally there's an echo on dialed calls, and the call key requires a firm push; if you aren't careful powering the unit off you might inadvertently redial the last number instead.",94,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,1.0,negative,"Don't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back. What I mean by that is that when your on the phone, the other party hears an echo.  This happend on all the calls. The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box!  I don't recomend wasting your money on this. One you may try that has worked for me is the H500.  Cheap looks ok and best of all, it works!!!!  Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3.",103,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,"I got this headset in a package deal with a Motorola V3 RAZR phone (sign up for service, get the phone and the headset free). Initially, I was very satisfied - it's light, fit my ear well, and I could hear callers as if they were right next to me. But I was told by everyone I talked to using this headset that their side of the conversation had a very pronounced delayed echo. I tried re-pairing it with the phone, re-charging the battery in the headset and the phone - didn't help

I also had issues with it not recognizing my phone when I tried to turn it on. This happened several times, and I had to re-pair it with the phone each time, which was a total pain.

I had some difficulty answering incoming calls with it also as the button is a multi-function button, which uses a series of beeps to let you know what function it's on. Kinda sounded like R2D2 from Star Wars - not fun to try to interpret while barreling down the interstate with a ringing phone in my purse.

Since these were issues I wasn't willing to put up with from a device that's supposed to make my life easier, I have since replaced it with a Motorola H700, which I am much happier with.

Guess I know why the H3 was free with plan activation. Lesson learned! =)",237,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,"Once you start talking on the phone using a Bluetooth Headset, you won't want to go back to holding a phone to your ear. The Motorola H3 Bluetooth Headset is a must have. I use it with my RAZR and the sound quality is great. Voice dialing with the H3 is a piece of cake. It's perfect for use in the car and works great for me and I have a manual transmission.  I'm getting about 8 hours of talk time on a charge; well over a week on stand by. Pairing up with your RAZR is simple and takes about 30 seconds. It's a little bigger and a little heavier than the H500. I'm assuming they have the same electronic components in each and just a different cosmetic shell.  I like the look of this H3 a little more than the H500.  I like the shape better and it's not as shiny as my H500 but performance and battery life for each has been identical so no complaints here. Volume is excellent for use in any car with the windows rolled up.  True, I couldn't use it in my Miata with the top down traveling on the highway but I don't feel that's a reasonable request for any Bluetooth Headset.

One warning to possibly explain those reviews where buyers had issue with this device is to watch out for knock offs on E-Bay. Although I purchased this on E-Bay, the second H500 I bought from E-Bay is what I would say works like a ""Chinese knock off"".  It works but is unreliable. It played the wrong tones to identify a function and too many tones when they weren't required. I'm wondering if some of the complaints about this device aren't related to knock off items.",296,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,4.0,positive,"This bluetooth is very nice looking......I like everything about it....I got one for my girlfriend and she loves it.

In fact he said that they (Cellular Sales - a Verizon dealer store) were dropping the Motorola H3 because of the exceedingly high number of returns and were sticking with just the Plantronics - which I then had him exchange my shoddy H3 with.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,"I can't understand all the negativity about this earpiece/headset. I have been through three other types and models and this is the best one for me so far.

I like the fact I can use the same charger for my Motorola Slvr 7L phone and this headset.

Setting-up was a breeze. Easy to pair with the phone.

The on-off button is great.

The battery life lasts a long time. Even with my headset on most of the time and all the talking I do, it lasts a long time on one charge. I have had this model for two weeks now and I have had to charge this only twice, once a week.

It fits great on my ear. And hasn't fallen off yet. It fits so well and comfortably, it is so light, that I wear it all day long. And even sometimes I forget I am wearing it.

There has been a couple of cases where I experienced a little static but it never lasted very long. I have had no problems with the volume or controls. I hear great. Even while driving the sound quality is just great.

This is a great Bluetooth headset. I recomended it.",200,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,2.0,negative,"I got this headset when I got my RAZR phone, and loved the fact that I could use the same charger for the phone and the headset, but that's about the best feature it has.  It did pair fine with my phone, and it seems to last a long time on one charge.  The interface is OK, but I still haven't gotten used to switching calls when I would already be on it and get a second call.  I hung up on people often trying to do this.

The worst features are seemingly the most important.  This thing fits horribly on my ear, and had a tendency to fall off.  The volume was so low that even at it's loudest I often had to press it to my ear to hear (hands-free, huh).  The worst was the static that either I would hear or the person I was talking to would hear.  Nothing seemed to improve it.

I just lost this earpiece, and I think it may have been a blessing in disguise.  I'll look for something a little better this time.",182,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,5.0,positive,"When I visited a local retailer, they told me this was the model of bluetooth headset that never gets returned by customers. On that basis, I decided to give it a try. And now, having used it for a week, I can see why it's rarely returned.

Sound quality is just fine for highway driving, even with the volume a couple of notches lower than the maximum setting.

Also, I have large, sticky-outy ears, and even on me, the headset is so light and fits so well that I can leave it on there all day. I hardly notice it's there. It stays on even if I swivel my head quickly when changing lanes.

I won't be returning mine either, and would have no problem recommending this same model to others.",131,23

I love the razor & have had no problems other's have described. If you put it on the right ear, the right way, it stays much better than others I've tried. It is clear as a bell & as far as the echo goes, if you turn the volume down on the headset, wala, the echo goes bye bye. All in all, I'm very pleased with it. My only complaint is that I don't seem to be getting the talk & stanby time described by Motorola or the person I got it from on e-bay. For the money, you can't beat it!! It cost me 1/3 of the price of the hs850 when they first came out. Always wait a while when a new product comes out-best advice I can give you.",159,25

I am not a techie person, but the reps. at Verizon told me a Moto BT headset should work fine on any brand of phone, but that wasn't the case.

I'm not sure if it is because of the size of my ears or what.  Connection was very easy and the buttons are easy to use.  The person you are talking to comes in loud and clear, loud and clear, loud and clear.... Oh, that must be that darn ECHOE problem.  I hear no echoe, but everyone I talked to complained of a poor connection or echoe.  This seemed to be a problem for both other cell phones and land lines.",101,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000EIXG7C,3.0,neutral,"Purchased the H3 to match up with my V3 Razr, which it does very well.

The H3 connects easily and quickly when turned on. It is very comfortable and looks quite stylish.

Two problems: 1) the max volume level is too low. This makes it difficult to use outdoors or in a car if wind and extraneous noise are present. 2) the volume controls are tiny and dificult to use. I leave mine set on the maximum and use the V3 volume control if necesary (rarely) to lower the level.

I like the H3 and intend to keep it for indoor use. When outside or driving I use the Cardo scala 500 which has great volume capability and wind noise protection.

The scala 500 is slightly less comfortable but overall, performs far better.",133,31

First, It tends to disconnect from my phone after 5 minutes of me not using it. Second, everytime I talk to someone on it, they say that they hear an echo of themselves when they speak. I don't hear it though, just the other caller. Third, at my job, we have a wireless camera system set-up, the headset fades in and out when ever I get near a camera. I really love the battery life and looks of the headset but I can't deal with all those problems. I going back to my Motorola HS820 headset.",118,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,3.0,neutral,"I bought this particular headset since it was one of the newer Motorola models and it was a decent price, compared to other models, on Amazon.  I like the fact that it charges over mini USB, like many of the newer phones do.

The unit is definitely lightweight, but it tends to flop around a lot on my ear.  The only way to really keep it in place is to not move your head much.  But I suspect this is due to the fact it only uses a simple ear clip, as do many other models.  So this may not be that much worse than many other units on the market.

So far I've used this headset in iChat AV (Mac OS X 10.4.8) and with my VZW RAZR V3c (04p firmware).  The earpiece seems pretty decent, as I've gotten good sound quality when listening to the person I'm chatting/talking with.  But on the other end, both users have said that I sounded very quiet and they had to crank their volume to hear me.

In summary, this isn't a bad headset when you consider the price, particulary if you are using this occasionally for chatting/hands free car use.  But if you are a power user who wants to use this all the time, I'd look elsewhere for something that's more stable on the head and with a little better volume.",231,0

-Small, lightweight

-Easy answering button directly on headset (with ring)

-Stylish, sleek and very comfortable

-Adjustable for either ear

Charging light on for 20 seconds or so and out. Press the on-off button, nothing. Very disappointed!
I have a blue tooth headset on all day long, so by purchasing this junk device that doesn't work it's slows down my effectiveness at work and this just doesn't fly! That is it for Motorola. Have had a number of Motorola Bluetooth headsets the last one I believe a 620. Came with plugin charger and charger lasted 4 year. It was great. Will try Samsung next.",135,29

Nothing beats the Motorola Bluetooth headset, and my original one lasted over 7 years, even though I broke (cracked) it, and glued it back together, and it continued to work until it just gave out.  I like that it hangs snugly around your ear, and nothing protrudes into your ear; it lays flush against your ear.  I never have a problem hearing, and no one has a problem hearing me.  It is very easy to operate, and the range is better than the phone range itself.

If it fit a little better and did not go in and out sometimes then I would give it a higher rating.

(Update)
I stopped using this headset because it would just disconnect from phone and I would have to restart it for it to connect again.  This started happening after people told me the going in and out was getting worse.  I have downgraded my review to 2 starts because of this.

I did receive complaints from the people I was calling saying that they couldn't hear me which was a pain.  My biggest complaint however is the way it ""wobbles"" on my ear.  Since there is no 'inner-ear' speaker, it's free to move around if you suddenly turn your head when changing lanes on the freeway or any other quick jerk.  This was the biggest problem for me because I used it 80% of the time on the road, and when I need to change lanes I don't want to feel like my headset could fall off.",118,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,2.0,negative,"A basic headset, probably overpriced as originally listed.  I received mine as a ""free"" incentive with a phone purchase some time back.  Was worth that price!

So far everything works as expected.

When I recently needed a bluetooth headset (my first) I asked my wife how she liked it, she said it was OK, and I bought one on sale for very cheap.  It paired easily to my new phone and the callers on the other side were clear to me, but the headset created a loud humming noise only audible to the people I was talking to.  It made it nearly impossible for them to hear me.  Here is what I disliked about it:
-the speaker sits on top of your ear and even at the loudest volume, I found it very hard to hear callers on the other end when I was driving
-the part that wraps around your ear was very, very uncomfortable on the back side of my ear.  I found myself taking it off when I wasn't on the phone
-the humming that callers could hear made it useless.  My wife's doesn't have this problem so I could have gotten a dud, but the comfort would have been enough for me to return it anyway, which I just did.",198,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,3.0,neutral,"This is the second Bluetooth headpiece I've ever owned.

The first one was a bit newer model from a different manufacturer - a pink one that was made for a woman. That one fit so snugly that it sometimes hurt my ear.... but it was hard to hear through it, and I lost it within two months of using it.

Having only owned the pink one for a couple of months, I didn't want to plunk down a whole bunch of cash for a replacement. So I bought the cheapest Bluetooth headset I could find - this now-obsolete Motorola H350, which has been on the market so long that I bought it for only $14.95 plus shipping.

If this were 1/3 smaller, and came with some sort of carrying case or clip, I'd like it a lot more.

Bottom line: This thing is made for a man. A large man. I'm a medium-sized woman, so the earpiece is incredibly poorly-fitting, barely staying on my ear. It's so loose that it swings away from my face when I wear it. There's absolutely no adjustability whatsoever. It's kind of astonishing how poorly designed the ear hook is.

I have used this with both Motorola & Nokia cell phones & have had no problems. The only caution I have noticed is you must have your phone set to manually add devices. Otherwise you won't be asked the passcode & the headset won't work as well.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,5.0,positive,"I have had this bluetooth ear piece for at least 2 years. It is durable. I drop it all the time and it is still going strong. It is light weight, so it doesn't bother you too much for long conversations. The battery lasts a long time, after several years of use, the battery still goes several days between charges (with a couple hours of conversation and the rest of the time on standby, takes approx 2 hours to charge fully).

I use it with a T-Mobile Dash phone. It is easy to pair up and the initial code for set up is 1234. Before this phone, I used it with a Razor. It connected well with both phones. Occasionally, you have to turn the ear piece on and off a few times before the phone finds it and connects, don't know if that is an issue with my phone, the ear piece, or just bluetooth in general.

I'm surprised the price has not dropped at all for this item (although I can understand why as it is a quality product). I bought it 2+ years ago at a Sam's Club for $25.

Another Pro about this item is that it is easily interchangeable between left and right ear, so if you get tired of having it on one side during a long drive, you could easily flip it to the other side quickly (even while in the middle of a conversation!)

I highly recommend this item.",247,84

I read a review a while ago that said something like, ""This headset was so loose, that while driving I went around a curve and just the gravity from that pulled it away from my ear.""  I though this was an exaggeration and bought it anyway because it was on sale locally.

She was telling me that she would answer the phone and there would be no sound and there was nothing you could do to talk to the other person. She kept having this problem periodically and I thought it was just her, so i traded her my 505 for it. I had the same problem. It would work for several calls, then I'd answer the phone and there would be no sound. It wouldn't let me transfer the sound to the phone, and if I turned it off, it would still beep when a call came in. The only cure was to turn the headset off, then shut the phone off, and on again. It was somehow taking over control of the phone to the point where i couldn't disconnect it. I sent it back to Motorola for a replacement, (their customer service is excellent by the way) but the replacement does exactly the same thing. Two different types of phones also, she has a Nokia and I have a Sony Ericsson. It's just not worth buying for the frustration you'll get from it. I've had two 505s and an 850, and the 505 was the best.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GUKT9Q,2.0,negative,"This product works pretty well but definitely isn't the most practical in terms of ease of use.  I think it is a limitation of BlueTooth in general but it is really a pain to have to hold the button down just the right amount of time to get it to turn on/off, redial, etc.  The earpiece is comfortable but doesn't take into account that some of us wear glasses.  When I have them on I find it doesn't fit behind them and if I turn my head it's possible the thing will go flying.  Also the volume up/down are on opposite sides which is awkward - when trying to use one hand it is hard to not push both up and down at the same time which seems to mute or somehow turn the unit off so I have to drop off calls suddenly.  Charge lasts a decent amount of time and the sound and voice dialing are great.  It's decent, and better than holding the phone when driving, but I'd like to see if newer headsets have improved on any of the features.

I contacted Motorola and worked with their tech support to reset the headset (turn it on, charge it for 3 sec with the power adapter, unplug it and its been reset).

In general the sound quality is accaptable on my end.  I've noticed a good bit of static when I'm talking with my phone in one of my pockets on the opposte side of my body (weird).  Static usually isn't a problem when I keep the phone somewhere on my right side (same as the headset).  Also, sound quality is generally good when there is a clear line of sight from earpiece to phone.  In that respect, it's nice to be able to leave the phone in one part of the room and roam around doing stuff while having both hands free, or use it while driving.

One big downside that I've come across is that the people on the other end of a phone call complain frequently that they can't hear me, even when the reception sounds good on my end.  When I turn the headset off, and use only the phone, they say that it sounds much better.

I would attribute some of the blame to my phone (Palm Treo 650) but my brother and father both have the same phone, and both use a different headset (they both use one of the other motorola headset models), and they don't have any complaints over their use.  Also, they sound loud and clear when they talk to me.  So the reception problem is probably the headset.

In venues where there is more noise and/or people, it's deficiencies become glaringly apparent, rendering its use unacceptable in public places.

For me, however, that's a small miracle. I enjoy the benefits of Bluetooth technology without walking around a store talking to myself to the ire of anyone in my immediate vicinity. I needed a hands-free device for work and travel. This fits the bill.

If you are tempted, as I sometimes am, to seek a headset grafted to your ear 24/7, this device offers neither the audio quality, the looks, nor the comfort you are looking for. If you're looking for a basic hands-free device that gets the job done, this is a heck of a bargain.",203,145

Also, in term of call features, you can recieve, reject, even put a call on hold while you're getting another call with just one button.

However, I think the way manufacturers design bluetooth headsets, where it's so high above the mouth, reduced the sound quality significantly. People keep on telling me to repeat what I'm saying because they can't hear me clearly. Don't get me wrong. People on the other end CAN hear you if you speak loud enough. But if you compare speaking on bluetooth headset (on a normal position) with speaking on the phone microphone or a cable headset, bluetooth headset still have inferior sound quality.

Pairing was a breeze.  The most annoying feature I've found is that the microphone is a little TOO sensitive.  My caller could hear themselves speaking when I had the volume maxed--which is needed in noisier environments--and there were sporadic bits of buzzing/static on their end as well.  I'm forced to choose between hearing clearly (and them getting their own echo) or canceling the echo by lowering the volume (and possibly missing what they have to say).

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,"Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset review

Headset used with T-Mobile SDA and now the T-Mobile Dash

Pros:

Easy to pair

Good sound quality inbound and outbound

Easy to use

Quickly connects to phone to answer or make calls

Cons:

With glasses it gets loose around the ear and feels like it's flopping around.  Most of the time I can fix it by wedging the headset around the ear before I place my glasses on.

DON'T PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET WHEN THE HEADSET IS ON! I've made so many involuntary phone calls it's annoying.  I even turn it off, but most of the time when I sit down the pant pocket fabric pushes on the ON/OFF button and it's on.  I wish they would recess the ON/OFF buttons to avoid this!

Battery life.  It claims to have 8 hours, but I'm not sure I'm getting that.  The battery seems to die much sooner than 8 hours, although this is not based on a real test.  I'm comparing it to my previous Jabra which could go for days without a charge.  This one is charged at least every 2-3 days.  I also turn it off every night and during the day to avoid the involuntary calls (altough it still happens)

Hope this helps!

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,4.0,positive,"It seems really strange that so many people had such a hard time with this product. I purchased one of these (for $70 6 months ago)along with my verizon/motorolla razor phone and it's works great! the set up is extremely easy and turning the phone on and off is extremely simple (one button!). for those who said this is the picture of the h700 i can tell you right now that my h500 (it has this name on the packaging AND when i connect it to my phone) is the exact same model as pictured, color, buttons and all. The only thing i have to say is that the range may be considered short to some people. I mainly use it while walking or in my room while i'm doing paper work, so it's never farther than 20 feet from the phone. when you get about 25ft or farther, the voice quality becomes a little distorted and gets worse the farther you are. The simple solution to this is to keep the phone in the room you're in or an adjacent one.

I've had this headset for half a year now and it's never given me any problems. It has a very nice stand-by feature that conserves the battery when not in use and the battery life seems to be 2-3 times that of my phone. The quality of sound is great, i'm a music student and often play new piano pieces i've written over the phone to friends and family and they never had a problem hearing the full range of notes clearly.

It's been the perfect headset for my needs, the only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the range, which isn't an issue at all for myself (though others may want a longer range).",300,1

Hey Kim,

We apologize for the inconvenience but it seems that we have just ran out stock
in those new .
We can offer you a partial refund for your troubles .
Please let us know what you rather do.

When I placed my order, it said new, and they send me a used one. Their response is they have run out of new ones. REALLY??? Then they are talking about giving me a partial refund............UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! FIRST & LAST time I'll order from this seller. Like I stated before, the bluetooth, works, it's just used & that's not what I paid for. My rating has nothing to do with the product, it's all about the seller & the shady way they are trying to conduct business.

I prefer the kind that have the flip mic boom that automatically turns off the headset when closed for SOOOO many reasons.  However, I kept having issues with the mic eventually ceasing to work at all.  I could hear the other person, but they could not hear me at all.  I had one headset replaced on warranty, but after the warranty ended on that headset, it too ceased to work one day.  So I decided to try this headset, the Motorola H500.

For the most part, I can hear the person on the other end of the line just fine, although I will admit that sometimes having the phone in a pocket is a bit more of a problem that it has been with other products.  However, I get almost unanimous complaints about the quality of my voice to the recipient at the other end.  It works, and is tolerable to some people who get used to it, but I have almost had to stop using the headset so that people can understand me.  Obviously, this kind of defeats the purpose of having a headset!

The other major issue I have with this headset is that even if I turn it off before putting it in my pocket, it will often press against something in my pocket long enough to turn itself on, and the proceed to call someone unbeknownst to me.  With the flip boom, this was not an issue, but it is something to keep in mind with this model.

If it was recessed, it might be OK. As it is, the button is easily engaged unintentionally. Even in the moto belt clip case specifically designed for this hardware, it accidentally activates. And you are left wondering why your phone says connected but you can't hear anyone.

Good price here, much less than I paid years ago. Decent value. Worked fine w/moto razor; sync'ed up with my new blackberry no problem. If you keep it somewhere - when it is not on your head - where it will not activate spontaneously it should get the job done.",115,67

After 2 weeks all I can say is, if you are looking for a good bluetooth, pass this up and shell out the $40 or more dollars to get a better one.

Cons:
- Several times my connection has dropped mid-call...for no reason (about 5 times over 2000 minutes of use).
- Should you ever drop that call...there is no way for you to reconnect without hanging up on the call, and dialing that person/conference back.
- You can NOT have the volume turned all the way up (which is sometimes necessary to hear properly, i.e. conference calls) the other person will get their own feedback.

- Price
- It does work and call quality is clear.

The only problem is, it turns on WAY too easy. Because of where the power button is, if I have it in my pocket, it answers the phone all time even when I've shut it off. Many times I've answered my phone and couldn't hear anyone talking. Then, I hear a strange sound coming from my pocket just to find that my bluetooth answered, even though I had turned the power off.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,"To own a bluetooth headset, the right fit is essential. For me, this one lacked comfort. Maybe it's the shape of my ear, but it just never felt sturdy on my ear. Switching from one ear to the other is very simple though. Pairing is very easy as well. Volume is quite low for me, even at its highest level. When talking to someone, they usually tell me that they can't hear me clearly...as if I'm very far away. I can't hear the other person very clearly either...unless I push the headset against my hear with my hand (kind of a bummer when you buy one to be hands-free).

I have a Nokia 6103, and it intitally took about 5 tries to link it to my phone, but it works fine now.  Voices can be heard clearly, simple answer/call button, and so far the battery life is better than expected.  I've only had it a few days, though, so time will tell.  Volume buttons are straightforward, and the blue status light is a nice touch - can be distracting to some.  There is some slight crackle and distortion even when in close range to the phone, possibly from static electricity or other isolated EM interference where I was using it, but it was never enough to be troublesome.  It is light, clips securely to the ear, is symmetrical for left/right wear, has a soft coating, and I've been wearing it all day without any discomfort.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,1.0,negative,"While I will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit.  If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times.....  but if you want to turn it off, thats a whole different story.  Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it.  Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function.  I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device.  The button is also entirely too sensitive.  I've had the device in my cargo pants pocket (where this would be very little pressure on the device) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone.

Other issues are the charging indication isn't real clear and there isn't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device isn't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used (its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money).",219,106

It is very light and comfortable to wear and with easy access to volume/answer/end/mute buttons.

Sounds good and holds its charge well.  The trade-off between this type and those that wrap around your eat is that the former can flop around if you are leaning to one side and/or jogging/running.  But, who talks while doing that?  On the other hand, I prefer this kind because nothing enters your ear and they are more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time.

The Motorola is the headset I wish I'd bought the 1st time around. It is suprisingly comfortable, and doesn't take long to forget you're wearing it. There is no intrusion into the ear canal, allowing full air circulation and unhampered hearing of your surroundings. The earhook is slim and does not interfere with wearing sunglasses, which is something I can't say about the Plantronics 510.

Therefore while driving, and turn your head quickly, it shakes itself loose and is annoying. The range is not too good as well. I get alot of interference when my cellphone is in its holster on my belt. I usually have to bring the phone closer to the headset to get good reception. I also tried using it as a earphone for an mp3 player/PDA I have. The sound quality is not good enough to listen to music. Otherwise, it is OK. I had a moto bluetooth I bought a few years ago, and I am just disapointed that its performance has not chnaged much.",131,122

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,2.0,negative,"This headset seems to be the ""preferred"" headset of my friends.  However, whenever I'm not in a dead-still silent room, people have told me that I'm completely unrecognizable.  This is especially the case when I'm in my car.  Granted, I drive an Acura RSX, which is not known for its quiet ride, but nevertheless, I need something better.  I tested it out once, listening to messages that I left on other people's voicemails, and it sounds like I was in an underground cellar surrounded by lead.
So if you're going to be using this *only* *only* while in a dead silent room, this is the way to go for ease of use.
If you're going to use it any other way, try something better.  I still am personally researching what a good headset would be.  I may try the plantronics 510 or another more expensive plantronics.  I hear that the Jawbone sounds good but is very poorly constructed.",158,126

But the sound quality was poor and the device did not work as well as the one i got from the Verizon store (and ran through the washing machine).  For example, it would not pickup phone calls or disconnect them using the headset button - had to open the phone for those operations.
The company allowed me only to return the device (at my expense) for a replacement.  The sound quality of the replacement is better, but it still will not pickup or disconnect using the headset button.  I also have difficulty getting starting and ending the bluetooth connection.

The only reason why its not getting 5 stars is I'm use to the speaker to be a little louder and the max volume on this just isn't enough, and I find myself pushing  it against my ear which totally defeats the purpose of Handsfree. Besides that I really enjoy having this since I am a daily commuter. If you plan on using this while driving then the volume issue may come into affect, but its really a personal preference.

I have the Motorola RAZR phone so I originally bought the matching RAZR headset, (also made by Motorola), but as soon as I opened the package, one of the volume buttons didn't work. I of course returned it and then decided to do some research to find what headsets had the best performance.  While researching, I found that other people had encountered the non-working volume button issue with the RAZR headsets. So you might want to stay away from those.  I ultimately decided on this headset based on these aspects: light weight, good battery life and good reviews (durable, good volume, ease of use, longevity), the looks are pretty good too.  I read many reviews on all different models, and overall what I read about this headset was that it was pretty reliable and people were pleased with it, plus the thing was like $30 with shipping.  I use it all the time, no problems yet and no complaints.",163,144

I dropped mine about a week in from four feet up onto pavement, and the ear-clip chipped, making it fall out from time to time - definitely not rugged construction.  This unit picks up all kinds of background noise and garbles the voice so that you have to shout slowly to be understood at all.

His is not good. The piece behind the ear is not NEARLY as adjustable as mine is. Mine is moldable so you can sqeeze it and play with it until it fits the back of your ear....this one is just what it looks like! You can't quickly switch from one ear to the next on this one either!  I also liked mine because I was able to program different rings for different people or groups of people on my phone then when my earpiece would ring I could hear the different rings and know who was calling me without having to get my actual phone out of my purse! His phone does that too, but the headset only rings the main tone... not the different rings! It also picks up TONS of background noise....much more than mine! WHen he's in his truck (he has an old 1972 chevy) all you hear is the loud engine!

The biggest problem is the fit on your ear. I have average earlobes, and it never fitted comfortably. I always had a feel that it will fall down. This is especially a problem while driving, as when you are taking a turn and looking on your sides, moving your head fast, you feel that the headset will fall off. This is the most annoying thing.

It's not very sturdy product too. The small little thing that fits in your ear, it broke after two months only. It simply fell on the floor in a store, and the damn thing broke. It can't even stand a simple fall from such small height (man-height) !!!!

I would strongly suggest to find something more robust, sturdy, and one which can fit more better on your ears. Always first try in a store, and make sure that it doesn't break easily.",185,154

The Girl gave me all the right info to do just that.  The unit worked well so I cleaned it with Q-tips and glued the ear piece.  I really didn't want to go through this mailing thing back and forth.

Despite the higher price tag on the HS810, I feel this is a better headset.  It's very sturdy-I've dropped it on my hardwood floor and it still works just fine.  There is no unfolding boom mike with a hinge that wears out.  The controls are simple-hold down the call button to turn it on or off, tap it to answer or hang up.  Mating the device to my phone was simple and took seconds, and I haven't had it drop a call yet.  The microphone seems to work very well-I've never had anyone complain that they couldn't hear me, and I've used the unit outside in windy conditions.

Of course, there are some negatives. I wish the volume was louder-I have it turned up all the way and it still sounds a little faint.  The earpeice is tight and secure but it also pinches, so long calls are going to be uncomfortable.  It's also not as eye-catching as some other bluetooth headsets.

If you want a workhorse headset that's dependble, reliable, and sturdy, this is the unit for you. It's a great value for the price.",230,200
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000GX9D9K,5.0,positive,"No matter which manufacturer or what model, it has become impossible to get a positive opinion on a Bluetooth headset these days!

Everybody just keeps whining about range (read up on Bluetooth technology, will ya?!), crackle, low volume and disconnects.

I'm glad I took the user reviews for the H500 with a grain of salt, overcame my fear and got this headset for my Nokia 6230i.

Pairing was a cinch. In over two weeks of use, I have yet to experience a disconnect. Volume and clarity are pretty darn good, range is excellent (for Bluetooth) and battery life is AMAZING (4 days to a charge, on average, with fairly extensive use). I have tested this headset while on foot outside and while driving my car. No problemo.

My suggestion to the nitpickers complaining about these headsets: state the make and model of your mobile phone in your reviews. It could very well be that it is your mobile phone that's to blame for your poor experiences. Specifying the type of phone you use will enable potential buyers with the same phone to steer clear, while the rest of us can go ahead and enjoy the wonders of 21st century technology.

By the way, I am technologically savvy, have had bluetooth headsets for over a year now and, if you haven't guessed it yet, am very, VERY happy with the Motorola H500.

My problem is the constant turning on & off of the headset. The slightest pressure turns the headset on or off or worse yet dials the last person you called over and over and over again.  My brother had to turn his phone off one night because over a dozen calls were made by my phone becasue the bluetooth headset redialed.  This was with the heaset sitting on the counter next to the phone without anything touching it.

The design of how the unit hooks on the ear has much to be desired.  You cannot really adjust the headset very well, as the earhook only moves in one direction -- that is, it swivels to allow use of either ear.

The device is very small and compact with above average sound quality. The in ear device loop IS adjustable as the ear hook can be turned for use in the left or right ear and moved to the right or left for positioning. It may just be my ear but it was not complicated at all and the only way it would fall out is if I had the hook positioned on the wrong side of the speaker ( also indicated in the instructions ).

The headset falls out often.  I have a bigger then usual ear I guess, but still.  Other headsets are adjustable in one way or another, this one is not.

The one downside I did discover is that the battary needs to be charged everynight before I go to sleep. This device is a power hog. Make sure you have a charger at home, work and in the car. It has a mini-usb for the charger connection, so I can use the chaeger from my H700 at home and I keep the charger the Dash came with at work. the Dash also comes with a cable to synch with my lap top, that can also serve as a charger as well.

Maybe it's the operating system, Windows Mobile, as I've already abandoned a Samsung 730i a couple of years back. i think a PDA or even just a cell phone, should be intuitive in operation.  This one isn't.  To compound the problem, it self dials when you hit a button while it sits in your pocket or on the seat next to you when something touches it.

It's been reliable, although frozen up occasionally.  When I went back to the Palm just to test it, I was amazed how easy its obsolete technology works.

The screen is too small to visualize many things, the t-mobile network too slow in a dense urban county to provide a positive experience on the web.

I'm not one for taking the time to write reviews, but this cell phone is frustrating me. I first got a Dash in June '08. Around the end of August the screen first showed the famous Dash bleeding. I ended up taking it back to T-mobile for a replacement (considering I spent over $300 for the thing), and they (T-mobile) sent me a new one for free in the matter of a few days. Everything is great, right? Not quite, as a result, I ended up losing all of my contacts considering I couldn't read the screen or connect it via USB. Good thing my previous phone uploaded some of them online. Ok, so I get the new one, not another 2 months later the screen bleeds again.

If I use it for anything other than calls, e.g. music player or internet, I find the battery being extremely low about two hours later. For business people, this could be inconvenient. I personally find it frustrating.
The keys are almost too small for my fingers to type, so I find myself erasing text quite often.

It's hard to keep in my pocket if I have a plastic cover on it. If I just want to carry it with me, it will slip out of my pocket if I have a third-party plastic cover. But, if you have just the phone, the back is very good at keeping it in your pocket and purse.

I do love the music player, especially since it is Windows Media Player. The battery will be depleted in about two hours, so you don't have alot of listening time if you only charge your phone once a week. The headphones that come with it are a plus, meaning I don't have to buy a pair. I also love the sound-it's crisp and pristine. I love listening to my music on it.

If you are looking for a good business phone, you might consider looking around first before buying this. If you do buy it, be sure you completely charge your phone before you go out.

PROS:
- Big screen, awesome display
- nice keyboard
- very SLIM, especially compared to the chunky Blackberry
- E-mail looks like real e-mail, not like MS-DOS (as the blackberry does)
- Rubberized back is very nice to grip and hold, and very slim
- Usability is decent
- T-Mobile staff was helpful and nice and seem to really want to help (unlike Sprint)

CONS:
- Windows constantly crashes and skips from one application to another (I am on a webpage, and inexplicably, it skips to e-mail or some other app. Very, very annoying, over time).
- FREEZING: within 3 weeks, I have had to ""hard boot"" (remove the battery to get the thing to work again) 5 times. On average, more than once a week. Also, very annoying. Windows Mobile is about as stable as Brittney Spears on a weekend in Vegas.

- BATTERY: Battery power is very limited, particularly in Wi-Fi. normal battery power is o.k., but Wi-Fi sucks a LOT of power.

In short, I love this phone. The only problems I've had with it are accidental calls made (easily remedied with locking the phone when it's in the case).

The windows mobile functions are easy to use and doesn't take much time to figure out.  The phone overall looks great and I get a lot of compliments for it.

BUT!!!!! I had this phone for about a little over a month and never physically dropped it once.  It slipped out of my hands one time since I've had it and dropped onto the floor (from about 3 feet from the ground).  The screen cracked!!!!  I brought it to a T-Mobile store and aparently since I didn't have the insurance (my fault because i failed to get it) T-Mobile and HTC, the company who makes the phone, would not cover it even though it was still under warranty.  Luckily T-Mobile offered me a loaner phone, HTC wouldn't offer me one at all (in fact their customer service was terrible, i mean extremely terrible).  I had to ship it to HTC myself. it took them 2 weeks to fix it and recieve it back, all together costing me $139 plus a $16 shipping cost.

I love this phone, but I wish this mishap never happened.  now I've bought a silicon case for it and have gotten insurance for the phone just in case it were to happen again.  I could go into detail about how much trouble I went through but I hope the summary explains how UPSETTING this was.

I have had the phone now for over 2 weeks which I feel is long enough to make a judgement on it. First and foremost the size of the phone is great. Slim, sleek, slender and light are just a few ways to describe it physically. The rubber backing feels cool as well. The button layout is easly functional and to navigate. I like that the memory slot is in the inside since it makes it more sleek. I have 1GB card in the phone and it picked it up no problem. I really like the OS interface - its not complicated to navigate through and looks cool as well. At first there is a slight learning curve as to were everything is located but once you play with it its easy - plus with the shortcuts you can get to what you want fairly easy. The speakerphone at times can be hard to understand but over all it works well. Music throught the phone sounds good to. Not bad for one speaker. It has at times closed out applications for no reason but I usually just chuck that off to Windows. The overall performance isn't that bad. It does slow down at times but not drastically.

This review and the hosts of other reviews echoing the same sentiment should be enough warning.

The phone will have SOME good, even raving reviews, from owners who have YET to experience the cracked screen problem. I was one of the many DASH fans myself, until it broke on me last week.

The LCD screen on my dash just went bust all on its own. I treated this phone very carefully. I carry it in my pocket, and i always make sure its only in there by itself so nothing might scratch the pretty surface.

less then 6 month of gentle ownership, and the screen went bust. apparently *I* cracked the screen and Tmobile + HTC has zero interest in fixing this problem. no replacement phones, nothing.

and btw, even if you bought insurance, it would still cost you $110 to replace it, and they only let you replace your phone twice in a year i believe. and i have read of numerous cases where the screen went bust twice in a year.

Google ""Dash cracked screen"" before you purchase.

A phone that you can't put in your pocket without risking a cracking the screen and having to pay $200 for repair is very poor in my opinion.

I had read reviews about how the touch-strip was one of the cons of this phone but what some people don't know is that people who purchase the Dash can call t-mobile and upgrade for FREE to Windows Mobile 6! After upgrading I realised that the touch-strip configuration was fixed to where accidental touches are very rare :-)

Get this phone. It's sleek and can be upgraded to edit word documents. The keyboard may look small but typing is so easy. Another good thing aout this phone is that you can use your own mp3's as ringtones so paying $1.99 for ringtones is unnecessary :-)",183,40

after about two months, the LCD screen cracked, simply in my pocket in the car.  i didn't drop it or anything, yet the LCD cracks, cant use the phone anymore.  So i take it to the store, and this is apparently my fault, so no manufactor's warranty.  They tell me to call a phone repair company in my area to have it replaced.  I look online and find that many other people have had this same problem, as the LCD's on this phone are very thin and can crack with the smallest ammount of pressure.

That repair company says they are sold out of the screens now, as they have sold 50 replacements in the past 3 weeks.  I didn't know that t-mo sold that many dashes in the area every three weeks.  So i can wait around for the replacement LCD's to be restocked, then pay 150 for the same thin delicate screen.

Sorry, but i would never buy this again, seeing as i am sure that it will break again, and i will be completely out of luck, again.

I don't know the specifics, but the t-mo extended warranty has a deductable on top of the initial payment, so that isn't even a practiucle solution, in my opinion.",227,43

i upgraded from the treo 650 for a few reasons: wifi, outlook directpush. found wifi to be not that big of a deal actually.

considered treo 750 but it was so much bulkier.

the design is decent - wish the silver bezel was just black instead and the volume slider recess makes the product asymmetrical.

windows mobile 6 is a vast improvement although wish it was more responsive at times, but then again, it's checking email on 4 accounts constantly (outlook, gmail, yahoo and live).

not having a touch screen is actually helpful so don't have to worry about smudges on the screen. camera and camera app sucks, but that's expected.

battery life isn't great, but that's what you get for the thinness.

I have had no problems with service anywhere I go and my bill for the same services with Verizon is less to boot. I know Verizon has the EVDO network for data which is slightly faster the extra cost was not worth it to me at all. I tether to my laptop all the time and the extra charge they wanted ($15 a month) seemed ridiculous to me for something I use an hour a day maybe two tops was something I was not willing ot pay. Also after rebates T-mobile PIAD ME to get this phone VS Verizon where the best I was offered was something similar for $150 at the low end to $300+ at the high end was a nice savings for me.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000NNZT1Y,4.0,positive,"This is my first SmartPhone and I've had a lot of fun with it so far.  For being so small, the keys are remarkably easy to use.  I often connect it to my laptop via a USB cable.  If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4.2.0, your PC/laptop will recognize it as a network device.  A little bonus app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connection (granted you have the data plan) at no extra cost.

If you get the add-on micro SD card (about $80), you'll have no need to buy an iPod.  Windows Media Player (which comes standard) works just as well.

It has a built in 802.11b (or g?) card.  When I'm in range of wi-fi, I can use Skype and save my minutes.  I hope T-Mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch that loophole :)

A few of the cons:

-There is no scroll wheel like on the Blackberry.

-The battery charge doesn't last longer than a day or so if you've got data push to Outlook enabled.  If I forget to charge it at night, I'm SOL.

-The volume strip on the righthand side drives me nuts.  I'm constantly hitting it by mistake.  When I do, an annoying popup interrupts whatever I'm doing.  You can disable the volume strip, but it's kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player.  A simple classic volume dial on the side would be a huge improvement.  The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume.

-The keyboard is nice, but a touch screen would be better for certain apps.  There's no way to cut-and-paste.",279,48

The entire problem with this headset is that it uses an AAAA battery - you read that right, not triple-A, quadruple-A. These batteries are hard to find and expensive. Cheapest ones on Amazon are still nearly $1 apiece. Good luck finding them if you run out while you're on the road. Oh, and GOOD LUCK finding rechargeable ones, not to mention a charger that will work with them!

And you'll have to feed them to this headset. It will still work as the battery begins to drain, but I found call quality dropped significantly after just a couple hours of use. You will be able to make calls, but there's no guarantee the people on the other end will be able to understand them.

I am very happy with this case, especially so because of the price.  On one hand, it slips easily onto the phone, but does not ""slip off"" nearly as easily -- you really need to be intentionally trying to remove the case for it to come off.  It fits snugly enough that I don't have a problem with dirt getting in to the case.  Even better, I really like the way it looks -- especially without it looking like a phone case; it just gives the phone a nice shine but does not make it obvious that its a case.

Also, it does come with a swivel piece and a clip, which I have chosen not to use.  Without the clip on there, there is no large wheel sticking out of the back of the phone, just a hole where it would go if you chose to use it.

Apart from that, it's a very nice mount for my 1st generation iPod touch. With the extension arm, it keeps the iPod within reach in my 2001 Honda Civic so I'm not fumbling for it when I need it.

I'm not sure how it would work with a FM transmitter attached as I'm using a cassette adapter, but I do know I have to take it out of its case to work with it, which has been a bummer.

In fact, based on what I had read in the other reviews I would actually say that it works better than advertised. The suction cup works so well that the only thing I can figure is that the person that had problems with it did not understand how it worked. It is not the standard type of suction cup where you simply press it against the windshield and hope it holds. This suction cup works by placing it against the windshield and then turning the knob counterclockwise in order to pull the center portion away from the windshield. As it does this it creates a vacuum seal that so tight that you are more likely to dislodge the windshield than you are to remove this device from it.

The iPhone fits perfectly into the holder and the aux cable is nice and thin. I actually used the phone in this setup when I wanted to have a conference call and the other person's voice coming out of the car stereo worked great for that purpose.

The only caveat I would list is that if your car has a long sloping windshield you may find the extension not quite long enough to bring the phone within reach. You may be able to compensate for this by mounting it up higher. I drive a Jeep Wrangler and it has a pretty vertical windshield so I don't have this problem.",243,2

Now the review. I have to say I was very pleased with the product for about a few months.

I should note, the product came in a very generic white cardboard box. Yes, cardboard.

Then, it would refuse to stick to the windshield no matter how many twisting and variety of places I tried. It just wouldn't stick. Some of the components don't ""feel"" of high quality. (You get what you pay for)

Not so with this holder.  This is the only one that I could mount under the dash bar securely.  I put in the extension provided and slid the unit under the dash bar.  My iPhone sits right there firm against the dash in the middle, low so I have full visibility out my windshield.

Now there was a bit of an issue getting it to suction to the windshield.  It really did not want to hold the first few times I put it against the windshield.  The suction and the screw down piece that aids the suction didn't want to work together, but once it's on there, it's on.  I will need to leave it in the Jeep because you have to take off the plate that holds the phone to get the unit under the dash bar.

UPDATE:

Well, it stuck to the windshield for just under two weeks.  Getting it to stick again is a no go.  It won't stick on there long enough to use the screw down mechanism. We have used gaffer's tape to the dash to hold it.  We can't figure out why it has decided to not stick anymore.  Change in temperature?  Humidity?  My windshield is a perfect flat surface, so it should stick.  We are considering getting rid of the arm altogether and just using gaffer's tape to stick the iphone holder portion to the dash bar.",279,10

I use it 5 days a week in the ambulance and it has not fallen off one time. I did have trouble like others mounting it the first time ((( BUT IF YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS))) it mounts solid. I actually have it mounted to the door glass in front of the A/C vent as the windshield is too hot here in Phoenix, and it still has not come off even with slamming the door 50x a day on top of running a heavy truck all over town 60 hours a week. It did not have a hole for the camera, but I drilled one with no problem. The only drawback is its limited angle of viewing, you can not make it turn 90 degrees toward you from the side window. It sits about 70 degrees and is fine, I can still see the map easily and read any text or email without problem. The power cord fits perfectly and so does the headphone cord.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,5.0,positive,"Bought this soon after purchasing Navigon for my iPhone 3G. It holds the device perfectly fine for my needs. Two things to be aware of:

1) When attaching to your windshield using the suction cup, you must twist the knob closest to the suction cub COUNTER-CLOCKWISE. This sounds counter-intuitive, but it actually pulls the center of the suction cup away from the glass, making more of a vacuum inside and, thus, strengthening the suction. I don't believe the included instructions are clear on this, so consider this a heads-up for those who can't figure out how to get the suction cup to stick to their windshield. Once the vacuum is created, it'll take a sledgehammer to remove it. Or turning the grip clockwise.

2) Even when all the joints are tightened down all the way, the mount will still pull in a direction if you use a power adapter that stretches to reach the device.

But even with all three (three!) very ugly arm parts attached, it cannot achieve enough bend to get the iphone aligned with your eyes.  In other words, it doesn't handle the slope of a typical windshield.  Bear in mind I'm using mine on a truck, not a race car, so there's not much slope to begin with.

The cheap plastic does not flex, but the whole contraption bounces when the iphone is in it and you're driving down the road.  Very distracting if you're using the GPS function, as I am.  The audio cable that comes with it the cheapest quality I've ever seen, and short.

I haven't used the secondary mounting device (glue a disk to your dash, apply the suction cup to that).  Using this would probably solve the angle issue, but is no use if you intend to move your iphone and mount between cars.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,3.0,neutral,"The WindowSeat by Griffin Technologies is designed to hold your iPhone in your car. It is a must-have if you plan to use your iPhone as a GPS device while you drive.

The mount ships with three case holders for the iPhone 3G, iPhone, and 2nd generation iPod touch. There is no crade for the first generation iPod touch. Also included are the suction mount, a headphone cable (for connection to a car stereo), a manipulator arm, and 2 extensions for the manipulator arm. It is fairly easy to set up and install. Power connectors are sold separately.

Pros: The iPhone (I have the 3G-S) installs in a snap. It clicks into the mount and stays in place quite well. The mount allows for rotation from vertical to horizontal.

Cons: There is no way to place the phone in the cradle without removing it from whatever case you may use. That really sucks. Also, the manipulator arm only bends so far (I'm guessing maybe 40 degrees), so you will need to use the additional arm extenders if your windshield has a steep angle so that the phone will face forward while you use it.

This is a great mount. That being said, it needs work before it can be used effortlessly. I'd like the option to purchase additional cradles for use with iPhone cases. Also, they need a ball-joint on the arm that has more angle to it.",238,26

But then it is too high and in my driving view. Also with the extension it sticks out too far which also made it less stable causing it to vibrate while driving.  One other complaint I have is that the joints are large and bulky making it an unsightly mount. The one positive is that the suction cup design seemed to work well, screwing the base pulls the center of the suction cup inward.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,3.0,neutral,"I just bought this on Christmas Eve since I really wanted to test out my first iPhone GPS app (the $1 MotionX GPS Drive, which recommended this Griffin mount on its web site). I rushed out to the Apple store at 3PM on Dec 24 and got the last one.

Bad idea.

First off, the Apple store charges over 100% markup. Yes, I bought it for $30 at the Apple store when you can get it elsewhere for $15 (or Amazon for like $12).

Second, I couldn't get my iPhone to fit into the damn thing until I realized, oh shoot, I have to take off the protective case. Seriously folks, we need a mount that will accept iPhones in their cases! Make a separate model JUST for those 75% of us who have a protective case and don't want to take it off each time we go into our cars.

Finally, the biggest problem is what those have mentioned here before: the options for positioning the mount are limited given the design of the neck. I gave up after a few minutes of frustration trying to get right angle.

I returned this to the Apple store the same day and swapped it for the Kensington model that works in the air vent and also amplifies sound -- a little more expensive, but it mounts pretty well into the car's AC vents rather than relying on the suction cups only. It also works with iPhones that have cases on them. So far I've been pretty happy with it.",258,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,4.0,positive,"I purchased this because I wanted to be able to use my iPhone as a GPS and music player, and this cradle is perfect for the job, but it took some work on my part.
The suction cup is a bust.  It works fine on glass, but that put it out of my reach because my windshield is so sloped.  On the disk/base, it's completely useless.  If you cut off the tab on the side of the suction cup, it might hold better, but it prevents the unit from sticking together.
The armatures/extensions are a nice touch, but you can't make a 90 degree angle (sadly), and if you're using two of the extensions, it gets pretty shaky, and the leverage is guaranteed to loosen the unit's grip (again, unless it's right on the windshield).
What I ended up doing is getting some Shoe Goo and just epoxying the base to my dashboard right under my stereo, and epoxying the suction cup directly to the base.  With that modification, I don't need the armatures, I don't need anything else.  It's the perfect location and length.
If you're prepared to do a little bit of DIY on your dashboard, then this unit is the prefect cheap holder.  It holds securely, comes off when you want it to, and swivels easily.",219,33

Mine came with 3 one more 2"" arm section than it's typically pictured with which is nice, but length isn't the problem it's that it doesn't articulate (bend) enough.  The ball joints should have more range of movement.

Pros:  Holds my iPhone securely in the bracket

Cons:  Cord too short, suction cup is cumbersome to attach and release as you rotate a knob that's not designed for a quick mount or release.  The range is limited, in that the crane is short in length and will not extend or swing around for adjustment.

The car charger I bought of this brand also died after 2 weeks of use in my car.

I went to the Apple store and bought a nice solid gooseneck that plugs right into my car charger to charge the battery, hook up to my stereo speakers, and does not obscure the view of the windshield as the hard flexible gooseneck extends vertically up from the charger and floats the device solidly in air instead.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,3.0,neutral,"The best feature is that the suction cup is one of the best I've seen.  This is because the amount of vacuum you create is dependent on how much you twist the base.

On the other hand, the angle you can tilt is very minimum.  It does come with additional ""arm"" piece so you can increase the total tilt angle, it also makes it a couple inches taller/longer off the base so it sticks out too much. I would like to see Griffin come out with a gooseneck using the same suction base so it'll give me more flexible bending option.

Finally, the holder is very tight.  It does keep iPhone from easily coming loose, but if you have a protector film like InvisibleShield (like I do), then you won't be able to put your iPhone on.  I ended up mounting on my desk at home (it's a real office furniture with cherry wood with glassy polish) and I rest my iPhone 3GS on it.  Disappointed that I could not use it in my car...oh well.  Griffin products have good concept, but their execution falls little short.  I bought their holster for my original iPhone, but the clip that is attached to the holder easily broke off.  It was one of the best holster style I've seen...too bad they didn't make sure it stood the test of time.

I have two issues with this item. First, and to no fault of it's own, when this holder is attached, I can't put my sun screen in the windshield. I think i'm going to trim the screen so it will work. Secondly, I have to take my phone out of the case to put in the holder. this is kind of a pain in the arse, especially for short trips.

The part that holds the iPhone is great, but the suction cup and ""arm"" are terrible to deal with. The way it's designed, the arm doesn't tilt enough to make the iPhone straight up and down. There's a very small amount that you can adjust the angle of the arm, then you have to tighten four total rings to stick it in place. Then it's still not straight, even with the extra extension arm which looks weird and ugly, and now you have a long bulky ugly arm coming from your windshield. Why couldn't they just take a note from GPS mounts?

I cannot recommend this item at all.

***Update:

I didn't use it for a while and the rings you use to tighten the arms got stuck on. I used pliers to try and loosen them so I could adjust the arms, and ended up breaking the fragile plastic instead.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0014YJHNW,3.0,neutral,"When I first read a review of this product online, I was quite impressed...finally, an iPod mount that would work.  When I received it and put it together, I was disappointed.

Allow me to elaborate...Griffin has a good idea here; instead of a goose-neck, it uses a ball-and-socket joint-type system of arms to position your iPod touch/iPhone.  The problem here is that you have a limited amount of positions to put your iPod in.

Second, the suction cup is not as strong as it needs to be; it's a good idea on paper (instead of a snap-down toggle like most mounts, it's a screw-down type that should hold the suction cup more securely to the windshield), but the suction cup is very difficult to get to stick to the windshield, and you have to really press hard against it while screwing it down, and even then it would detach from my windshield at the worst possible moment (driving down the Garden State Parkway at 70 miles an hour).

Third, it will not work with iPods/iPhones in cases...I don't want to have to remove my iTouch from its case every time I want to take it on the road.

Griffin has a decent product here that just has a few problems that prevent it from being a great one.  If they address the suction-cup issue, and make a mount that allows for holding an iPod in a case, this would be a much better product.",244,59

My first issues is that it was practically useless in the Honda Element. I could not find a suitable place on the window to attach and have access to the Iphone. This was mostly due to the angle of the Honda Elements window and not the WindowSeat. After finding a suitable configuration the unit would fall off every 24 hours or so.

I decided I might have better luck with the mounting plate and I installed it next to my shifter. Same problem the suction cup would not stay seated. I would be driving down the road and thud there goes my expensive iphone again. Where is it? Under the brake pad, let's see if I can reach it before I crash....

After trying another mounting plate, this time on the dash I'm still plagued by the falling Iphone every couple of days.

Despite the on-line reviews that warned of how uncomfortable they were to wear over a prolonged period of time, I felt the headphones were somewhat manageable. Yes, they are not all that comfortable, and yes, they do make you look like you are wearing earmuffs (i.e., the Princess Leah effect, if you will). Nevertheless, in viewing the product as a whole, I regarded these weaknesses outweighed by the strengths of the product.

I also found the Bluetooth connectivity to work well with my phone and my laptop. The bass is great and the mids/highs are good.  Outside noises seem to be blocked fairly well.

And I even own a very expensive pair of in-ear monitors that I'd trade in a heartbeat for the sound of these bluetooth headphones.

Con:  After about 6 weeks of heavy usage with my first pair, the very thin plastic began to crack over my right ear.  Due to the cracked plastic, they lost some of their snug fit.  I used some electrical tape to fix them, but the tape also made them less comfortable to wear.  Shortly after this, the left side cracked, too.  Taped it, too, but the crack was considerably worse.  It wound up cracking all the way through and was only held together by the wiring.  Taped again.  They work still but they are uncomfortable to wear, they don't get a snug fit so I get ambient noise and have some volume loss.

Lucky for me, my wife never uses hers, so I do.  But, I am very careful with them while in use as well as where I store them.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,2.0,negative,"I purchased these Samsungs because they seemed like they'd be the best value bluetooth headphones.  I generally like Samsung products, so I thought I'd give them a chance.

First of all, they sent me a pair in all black.  They weren't blue like the picture.  That made me mad.  I don't necessarily dislike black, but the blue touches were part of what excited me about the product design.

The audio quality was pretty good.  They got pretty loud, and they stayed pretty clear.  Sometimes the audio would do this time warp thing where the music would speed up or slow down a little bit.  I'm pretty sure that was the fault of my iPhone, though, not the headphones.

The charging port has pros and cons.  I like that it had a little door over it to keep it from getting dirty, but it's a proprietary connector, which was annoying.

The final blow for these headphones was the fit.  I'd read reviews saying that they were painful, and DANG THEY SURE ARE PAINFUL.  At first I figured people were just being big babies and that they'd loosen up over time or at least I would get used to them.  No dice.  These things slice into the side of your head.  Sometimes they would almost bring me to tears, and I have an incredibly high pain threshold if I do say so myself.

All that to say that I ended up returning them.  I replaced them with a pair of the Motorola S9 HD headphones.  They're about twice the price but worth every dime.  Attractive design, USB charging, great audio, and still less than $70.  I'm much happier with the Motorolas.",279,26

The only thing that gets to me is when someone is calling the music turns off and the ear phones answers the phone call when I do not want it to.

I love the design too, it fits good, however it may be a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours, but then most of the headsets would do the same.
I have used it for over two months now, and the plastic is still intact, so still going good.
I have used it on a few flights and then while driving too, as a voice call headset. it works great and pauses the music during an incoming call, and re-plays the music when the call gets over.
I had a little tough time connecting it to my phone for listening music though, as my phone, HTC Touch Pro2, recognized and connected to the headset but still the music was not played back on the headset and was getting played on the phone only. The learning was that for the first time registering the device, i had to restart the phone to make it work. Dont know why it needed a restart, but it did.

Overall, wonderful headset and good value for money.",215,31

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,5.0,positive,"I am an avid online researcher and purchaser and I have mostly been pleased with my results.  The purchase of the Samsung SBH500 I recently made is no exception.

I must admit that I was skeptical because there were so many reports of breaking and cracking and when I received my set I made note of the area that was pointed out and the weight of the headphones on the ends.  However I don't know if Samsung has made some design changes or if maybe I am just aware of the problems that others have reported but so far so good.  My set has a thin rubberized coating on the ""around the neck"" area and they seem to be pretty sturdy.  I am careful not to rip them off to quickly and to avoid getting them caught up in my hat or glasses and with a little luck they should last me a good long time.

As for the performance and the fit of the headphones I could not be happier.  They sound great and feel fine.  I use them mostly with my Samsung cell phone so for me the Blue Tooth sync was seamless and easy.  The battery life so far has been great with at least the predicted standby time and plenty of time to listen and or talk.  The hands free phone has worked beautifully as well with most people not even able to tell that I am using hands free.

Amazon had a great price and they shipped them on time and in great shape.  I am very pleased with the headphones so far and I would surely recommend them to anyone who takes reasonable care of things.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,3.0,neutral,"Great Fit! I got these for the gym so I can use my phone to run my music and track my workout with [...] on my G1.

Pros:
Off Switch.
This is usually missing from BT devices for design simplicity, but it's great to have when you have it.

Sound Quality.
UNREAL.  I've never had this kind of fullness in sound with a bluetooth stereo headset.

Controls.
Very responsive to my T-Mobile G1.

Pairing/Connection.
This takes very little time to reconnect with my phone.  Other BT headsets I've had in the past connect, but the sound sometimes doesn't route to the headset.  I've had to connect/disconnect multiple times before the sound gets routed correctly.  Not on this bugger.

CONS:
Earpiece broke.  I know you're thinking I did something stupid or careless.  These are great tech on a faulty plastic band. I only wore these to the gym and afterwards they were safely tucked into my backpack.  I'm careful with my stuff, but in less than a month it broke right above the earpiece on the right.

I've tried a number of devices, and all of them made me sound distant when talking on the phone.  This Samsung is not like that.

I think I may have worn this headset about 7-8 times all told in the 8 weeks I had it. And today, when I went to pick it up, one of the earpieces came off in my hand. Well, not a biggie I thought. I'll just call Samsung, they're a big company, they'll send out a replacement. Well....WRONG. I was told instantly that the neckband was not covered by warranty. The speed with which that answer was forthcoming brought to mind the numerous breakage reports I had read prior to purchase. Well, I have scheduled a 2-hour self-kicking session for later tonight.

I have logged on to amazon to replace these well used, and very satifying headphones. Here's the story. In February of 2009, I purchased a HTC Touch Pro but did not like the headset selection that they had had at that store(Wireless Toyz). I did a little internet searching and picked the SBH500. It took me a minute to learn the connection to my new phone, but it always connected after that. I used these headphones EVERYDAY since then. The sound quality of music/phone calls is excellent(kinda weird having a phone conversation in both ears) and these things get pretty loud. The battery life is great. Mine lasted between 4-6hr. per charge depending on how much I talked/listened to music. I walk my dog sometimes 2 hour at a time, and it would need charging every three days. The wireless is nice too. I live in a two level, and I can easily be 15-20 feet away(sometimes through walls) before it starts to break up. Outdoors this seems to be shorter, but I try not to leave my phone around outdoor. Speaking of outdoors, my headset has been rained onmore than a couple of times and still works. Not saying they are water proof,but good to know huh. The earpad on the inside of the headphones are comfortable. The downside? The pieces that wrap around your ears hurt after about a half an hour and found myself adjusting them alot. Eventually both of these started cracking and I started taping them. They finally broke last week, and I must replace them. I feel I got my moneys worth, and I hope you do to",288,59

The sound quality is excellent, the controls are intuitive, and the battery lasts at least as long as I would expect it to.  I tried to convince a friend of mine to invest in a pair, but being of slightly bulbous-cranium, the one-size-is-all-you-get form factor of these headphones just didn't work for him.  They do feel very fragile (the neckband is just molded plastic carrying the wire from one ear to the other), and I've never been willing to test that.  I either hang them up somewhere or wear them around my neck when I'm not using them, and so far, with that careful treatment, they've done great -- just around the house, doing yardwork, or working out.",171,60

The next morning I unplugged it and noticed that there was a crack in the plastic. I assumed that it was just a small crack...but while taking my walk in to the office this morning, the dang thing broke. The sound was decent on this pair...so I was happy. But I called Samsung today and I am being told that only the ""bluetooth"" mechanism is covered. What? You make a product but then refuse to make sure that it doesn't fall apart?

He synched it with both of them and if he get's a call while listening to his iTouch, he just presses the answer button and it immediately switches to the phone.  As with everything though, the experience can't be flawless.  First, amazon shows that this one is the blue accent model when in fact it isn't, it's is just straight black.  This isn't a big deal though I did intend on getting blue.  Second, the song controls don't all work with the iTouch.  This isn't the fault of the headset however or I would have rated it 4 stars.  This is due to Apple not fully implementing the bluetooh spec yet.  I assume they will at some point in one of there updates and it will they will start working.

It was only a couple of days before it split the plastic entirely and required copious amounts of crazy glue to fix.  Now, just about two weeks later, another crack in an entirely different part of the plastic behind the head is cracking.  Great sound Samsung, but really, really cheap materials!

I've never been accused of having a small head, and these fit just fine. The pads stay over the ear and cup them nicely. Turning to the right or left, they still remained centered reasonably well over the ear. You MUST get used to putting them on and over your ear. (To be honest, I would have given these a ""5"" if they had some form of telescoping adjustment. Even 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch of play would have helped those who complain about the fit.) Anyway, I've had them on for hours on end, and have not been uncomfortable.
Easy to pair, decent physical quality-not as fragile as some have characterized. (I think some people are REALLY tough on their electronics.) Great battery life and easy to store.

I think where this set really shines is the sound quality. I find it exceptional for a wireless set-excellent highs and nice bass. (Providing you've set up your music device's EQ properly.)

A good value at 39.00 and recommended.

Be careful of where you wear them. (And most BTooth headphones.) Your wireless router and those nearby can interfere, and your music will cut in and out.",201,68

The Good:
 - I like the format and the size.
 - I like the deep bass that only comes from headphones with large drivers.
 - The technical features are good (iPod track controls, phone toggle, volume).

The Bad:
 - The hard over-ear plastic thing that hangs on your ears was far too rigid and really began to hurt after about 30 minutes of use.
 - Sound quality is not very good.  Bass is good, but high frequencies are trashed, most likely by the Bluetooth compression.  Chances are the headphones themselves can reproduce music well, but the radio transmission process is creating noticeable distortion and garbage in the high freqs.

In summary, had I bought these just for use with phone conversations, I probably would choose to keep them.  But they promise good music listening (and now I want that!)  Sadly though, they aren't good enough for discerning listeners.",155,70

I recently purchased these and was very pleased with the sound quality. it wasn't the kind you get from overpriced noise cancellation headphones. its the kind you would get from a decent pair of sony over the ear headphones. great bass response, cushions are comfortable and block out sound at a decent level, clairty is good but could be better. the only possible downside is the comfort level. its a little uncomfortable after about 10 - 15 min but nothing worth returning them for. in my opinion every set of small portable headphones has a comfort issue. the in ear ones hurt your ear canals after time, the in ear ones that sit in your ear but not your ear canal don't stay in, the standard over your head band ones are bulky and annoying and every clip over the ear headphone that holds on to your earlobe hurts a little. the big difference is they are wireless. these don't hurt enough to return just as uncomfortable as any other headphone like it. overall great deal and $40 price tag is half the price as best buy.",203,71

Pro: Wireless!!! Great sound. Easy to use. Great Price.

Con: Pairing info is wrong! HOLD THE MAIN BUTTON WHILE TURNING HEADSET ON. Perhaps the Japanese/English translator got it wrong.

Misc: BEHIND THE NECK. This is not for everyone. I had Sony behind the neck headphones that took some getting used to, so I didn't have that breaking in period with these. I angle them so they're high enough in back to not hit my neck when I tilt my head up. This is vital in the gym. Its like a tag brushing your skin or the line in your sock rubbing your toes.

Basically, for $35, this is the item to get. If you're seriously going to spend $60 & up, look elsewhere.

They are a little on the uncomfortable side right above your ear but it's nothing that i can't bare and i do have a big head. I need them to hug my ear tightly when working out so anything less and i may have a problem with them falling out. I'm almost positive that a little black foam there would do wonders.
Overall i'm happy with them and would recommend them to anyone that is familiar with behind the head earphones.",96,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,4.0,positive,"First,  one ""pro"" point I have for this headset model.
1- They sound great

CONS:
1- Uncomfortable to wear
2- The picture shows the 'Blue' trim headset, however AMAZON shipped out the 'Black' generic version.
3- A pairing issue I had was due to IO error (idiot operation instructions). If you want to pair this headset to a new device-- turn off the headset and while turning it back on press the 'phone' button. This button should light a continuious 'blue' light. Once this is set you can pair it with your new device. (Step #2 in the Quickstart guide)
After working this issue with Samsung, I will now give this item a 4-STAR rating. (Minus 1-STAR for Amazon shipping out the generic black unit)",125,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,4.0,positive,"Work flawlessly with my lg voyager and macbook. The playback controls even worked with itunes. I'll revise this if possible to see how they work with my lg versa that I'm switching too. A little tight on the side of your head but not terrible to get used to. Great audio quality during music playback, even has decent bass. Call quality: the people I've talked to didn't even realize I was using a bluetooth, and I don't speak very loudly typically and don't have to talk loudly at all for the person on the other end to hear me clearly. On my end it did sound like I was talking through a bluetooth, but it wasn't hard to deal with (its hard to describe, but the person's sound is clear but its just not what talking on a cell sounds like natively). I have absolutely no problem with it, but it could have been better (speaking specifically about the incoming sound quality). Great for walking around campus listening to music and talking to people if a call comes in. One last thing, it could be my weird ears but even when walking somewhat quickly, not even running I sometimes notice a small sound as they move up and down my ear ever so slightly. This might make running with them annoying, but I haven't tried it, but maybe others listen to music a lot higher, but I prefer to be among the hearing.",243,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,5.0,positive,"I have tried more than 12 different bluetooth headsets.  The SBH-500 is the best ever.

I will buy a second SBH-500 as a backup.",72,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,4.0,positive,"Nice behind the neck phones, not as bulky as others reviews described. I find them more comfortable than my usual wired b-t-n phones. Buttons are simple and logical. Paired quickly with my Samsung Epix (i907) phone, for which I purchased an 8GB micro-SDHC card. The headset BT phone features are simple and conversations sound fine. Music pauses & resumes when calls come in. While listening to music in Windows Media Player mobile, the headset plays, pauses, skips, and adjusts volume fine... but will not start the media player unless phone is on the Today screen. (Easy music tip: build playlists in WMP on laptop/desktop, then sync playlists to phone.) I use them every workday, but not all day, maybe 2-3 hours of music and any phone calls. They can rest around the neck or sit on desk when not in use. A charge easily lasts about three days. They are powered on about 6-8 hours a day. I enjoy them a lot, always wanted wireless music for work and commute. Would buy them again if/when they break or fail (outside of warranty).",182,80

I've gone through more head phones then i can count so we're going to see if these can hold up. as far as any discomfort goes, it's all about how you have them sitting on your head. i'm used to this style of headphone and know how to get them to sit on my head. so just find how they sit comfortably on your head. so far they have been worth the money and time waiting for them.",144,82

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0016I6GUS,4.0,positive,"I bought these as a replacement to my Motorola HT820, and both the sound quality and maximum volume are levels above the Motorola offering.  Battery life is sufficient for wearing them for 2 consecutive 6-8 hour days (of constant music) without recharging the unit.  Controls are intuitive and logical.  This model allows me to search forward or backwards in a track, which the Motorola would not do.  Also unlike the Motorola, the well-padded ear cups are permanently attached to the headset, so you do not have to deal with them constantly falling off.

A word on the comfort issue.  If you are not used to the behind-the-neck style of headphones, avoid this model.  the hard Rubber where it wraps around the top of your ear can be slightly painful if you are not used to it.  I find it a fairly simple matter to adjust them to a more comfortable posture, but others may not find it bearable.

Overall I find it a great headphone for hard usage.  it moves flawlessly from phone to music, and can even partner a laptop & cell phone simultaneously.  But if you are a behind-the-neck novice, you may want to consider the Plantronics Pulsar 590 instead

EDITED five days later....

Never mind.  These are shoddily made pieces of junk.  Less then a month old and the ""slightly uncomfortable"" ear holder has broken in two with nothing but bare wires holding the control-side earpiece to the rest of the frame.  I better be able to RMA.  The rating for this item just dropped from four stars to one (well, one half, if I had such an option)",272,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,"I like the way this works but it's a bit bulky and hard to open. I think thinner leather, a smaller clip and an easier flap would improve things but its still good.",33,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,"The case seems well made, but the little things are either not thought through or not manufactured to spec.

The fit overall is reasonably snug, but since the bezel on the Note is so thin, there is precious little non-screen real estate on the sides, and the case could have benefited from more stiffness in that area. As it is, it just bulges to the left and right. The bottom strip also bulges in the middle.

The microphone on the Note is a small hole on the bottom of the casing; the case has a round piece punched out for it, but it's not quite centered on the hole. You have to wiggle the phone and/or stretch the leather from time to time to keep it open. On the other hand, the cutout around the USB/charger connector is huge (at least three times its width).

There is no (I repeat, no) way to connect the earpiece or headphones to the top jack when the flap is closed. Apparently, designers did not expect Note owners to listen to music or the radio while the phone is in their pocket (or to have a long conversation hands-free). Nothing that 5 minutes with an X-acto won't fix, of course.

Also (this concerns only the vendor, not the product), Prime members should not put their trust in the ""two-day shipping"". I ordered the item on Friday night, received a shipping estimate for Wednesday, and it finally arrived on Thursday. Six days cannot count as two under any definition of the term.",257,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,5.0,positive,does everything it said it would do. Nice leather case. good protection for the phone. case is black leather. there are pockets for credit cards. The case is constructed such that it allows all buttons and functions accessible.,38,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,2.0,negative,"To be perfectly fair, this is technically a very good case; offering high quality construction with plenty of functionality.  I actually found it nearly perfect on a recent trip to Washington.

That being said, I own the Ceramic White Galaxy Note, and this case actually stains the back battery cover.  Right in the middle, there is a pale, dark stain from the interior of the case.  I'm a bit of a fanatic when it comes to my electronics, and this is driving me nuts.  I actually had to order a new battery door from Amazon.

Again, great case; beware if you own the White Note.",105,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,"Part of my normal routine in the morning is to get in my car and drive to work.  If you have a similar routine you will need to know that the male stem on the back of the case that slides into the female groove on the belt clip pulled out of the back of the case.  There is a metal bushing that the stem threads into.. The bushing pulled out as well.

I only had this case for 2 weeks when it happened.  I wouldn't consider getting into my car to be abuse so I am hopeful that BoxWave recognizes this to be a design flaw.  It may be that for the Samsung Note, there needs to be more reinforcement.  I reported this to manufacturer over a week ago but still no response.

I have four more stars to apply to this review should they decide to do the right thing.",152,4

I then ordered the second one in hopes that the first one had been defective.  However, the second one only lasted a few weeks as the case did not fit my phone completely. It looked so weird as the case appeared too small for the phone.  Finally I had to take it off from the phone for a better look.

This case is overpriced. With the design and bad quality of this case, the listing price for this case is not worth it.",110,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,4.0,positive,"I found the case to be very well constructed and it looks great! The case is well padded but the phone in the case is still very thin and close fitting. The only two things I would change is first, have an opening for the headphones to plug into and second, the opening for the volume on the left side will never line up properly and it always is a bother, but, I never give up so the simple fix was; I removed my phone, pushed the top of the leather opening up and inward, putting a small amount of super glue in the crease and it is out of the way. It does not effect the looks at all and it is easy to use the volume rocker button.  I found all of the other openings lined up perfectly.  Please remember that with all leather cases you must seat the phone properly in the case. This could be corrected at the factory, but I do love the case! I ordered this from Amazon.com by next day delivery, and as always, I received it the next afternoon. This is why I use Amazon.com so often, they always deliver as they promise and everything is well packed and in perfect condition.",210,8

Not a great deal of thought seemed to have gone into things like the audio jack and mic openings. I could have lived with all that but what I can't abide is the fact that it broke within a month. What good is ""genuine leather"" if the plastic components are cheap. The piece that screws into the case and holds the belt clip broke rendering it useless to me.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,3.0,neutral,"I purchased this item based on the excellent review I read on Amazon. I used it for maybe a week and I noticed that the clip wouldn't keep it in place especially when in the car and getting out. It dropped a couple of times inside of the car, but when I got out of the car one day and dropped on the asphalt I realized that it doesn't fully protect the phone from the bottom. The other thing with it is a described by others that you can't use a corded earphone to listen to music or to talk, becuase the way the flap on the case is, it won't allow you. You would have to keep the flap open, then it wouldn't serve its purpose",127,13

This is not to say that there's no opening in the case for the volume rocker; in fact, there is an opening for the volume rocker...the problem is that the opening isn't big enough (and/or it's not properly aligned?), so whenever I try to use the volume rocker, it simply doesn't work because the case is always in the way.  Very annoying...",105,14

This item is at best a 2 to 3 star product.

Fashion disaster.",52,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00188ZOEU,1.0,negative,"This is a great case in theory, but the design is just not there. It doesn't fit the Note in a snug manner, so you are constantly having to move it around to gain access to the power and volume buttons. Additionally, the four buttons on the front face (home, back, etc...) are partially covered by the case making it difficult to use.

Would not have been a big deal, but when I wrote customer service I received absolutely no response at all whatsoever. Fortunately, I contacted Amazon directly and they gave me 100% of my money back and allowed me to return the case. I still have not heard anything at all directly from this vendor though.",118,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,"I bought the LG Vu to replace my Sony w810i and returned it.  The phone is very attractive, though I expected the quality of the materials to be better.  The touch screen works well, and the landscape QWERTY keyboard is great for text messages.  Call quality is good and the speakerphone is loud.

Five problems though: 1) The screen is barely visable in the sun, 2) The camera is better than most phones at 2MP and Auto Focus, but there is no flash and the Sony's 2MP camera took better pictures, 3) I'm on a Mac and I don't want an iPhone because of the monthly service plan cost, but the LG Vu does not sync with my Mac and the Sony did, 4) It does not work as well with my Acura's HandsFreeLink in car bluetooth, it does not show the battery life or signal strength, 5) The contacts does not provide a space for birthdays or addresses.

If these issues don't matter to you then I'm sure you'll like the phone.  I, however, was trying to upgrade phones, and a touch screen does not a great phone make.

P.S.: Sorry I can't comment on battery life or be more in depth, but I only had the phone for a day before I returned it.  I purchased an unlocked Nokia N82 a few weeks later and that phone is far superior (although the price is high).",237,0

No Sportscenter in the morning...no video highlights, just scores.  Whoopee!  No MLB, just college baseball and lacross for the most part.

I owned a so-called ""smartphone"" prior to this one and had the upgraded battery and guess what, the huge battery for my moto q didn't last more than two days anyway. Large batteries are not worth the trade-off you give for space and extra weight. My vu lasts for two to four days and it is over two years in service with the original battery. One last bit of advice (for anything with a touch-screen), buy and use those clear screen protectors. When they start looking like hell, trash them and stick a new one on. If you compare this phone to an Iphone, the comparison is much like comparing a top of the line bmw seven series to a top of the line ford.

I had the data plan up until a few months ago when AT&T decided to change there pricing plan for unlimited usage (was $15 then $10 then change it back to $15 unless you had another user using the plan to qualify for the $10 rate what a rip).  I had some issues with calibration but this was easily taken care of.

Typing on the keyboard was a hit and miss sometimes not a big texter mostly used the keyboard when accessing the internet dialing numbers was also cumbersome at times.  The phone worked like a charm up until the end of last month when the touch screen started acting up (would either freeze or jump from screen to screen or jump back to the main screen).  I did take out the battery and try a few different methods before taking to AT&T they tried for 20 minutes no luck only told calibration is off and that I should either get a go phone or put my sim into another phone.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,1.0,negative,"I can relate to all the negative reviews.

As noted in John Earnhart's review, ""forget trying to use your number pad while making a call."" If you made a call and need to press numbers to go through a menu system, it is SO FRUSTRATING!

As for texting, both of my kids hate using this phone for it. It's VERY slow compared to ""hard"" keys. Both wish they still had their old razr phones.

I had two of these phones and I had to send them both back.  No matter how long I left these on the charger, they would never indicate that the battery was fully charged.  I could leave it on the charger for 2 days and it would never say charge complete.  So, I sent them back and ordered the Motorola Karma.

All in all, if you can get a phone without that problem with the charging circuit, it is a nice phone.  I wish LG would get their act together in the Quality Control department.  Since I have encountered this, I have found that this is a fairly frequent happening, and has been going on almost since the phone was first introduced.

It is usually either in the recharging station, sitting on my desk or in the cell phone pocket of my bag. It just stops working out of the clear blue.

Every LG VU CU920 I get loses the touch screen capability within weeks or months. I can answer calls because that is a mechanical function, but otherwise it becomes a paper weight.

I have insurance on the phone and when I called to get it replaced I was told that they no longer carry this phone and they offered me the Samsung Solstice instead.  Even they are done with this phone.  I think there is a problem with the touch screen sensor because I touch the screen and it registers on the other side of the screen or I'm not touching the screen at all and the screen starts clicking things itself even though I am not touching anything.  With touch screens once the screen goes the phone is unusable.  My next phone will have normal buttons, you never hear about buttons malfunctioning.",178,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,"I was excited to upgrade my phone. I upgraded to the VU back in April. The phone was to my liking then, but after about 3 months, my touch screen started acting finicky. I baby my cell phones, and this one was no different, so I had no clue what happened. I tried searching online, but I couldn't find anything. In fluorescent light, you can see the oil-like colors of the touch screen, and it looks like it seeped out of the interior, and now when I use the phone, I'll click one place, it'll register in another. It's very frustrating to deal with, knowing that AT&T won't help me out with it either.

The touchscreen interface is nothing like that of the iPhone which is to be expected, but this touchscreen could be so much better. The menus are okay, not the greatest. Camera quality is average, video quality isn't that great.

I was not satisfied with this phone. I wish I would have gotten something different, because now that I am looking for a new phone, there are numerous out there that are better than the VU.",189,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,"I bought this phone in april this year. I really wanted a touch screen phone, but that turned out to be the really bad feature of the phone. It has really good reception and calls are clear, but texting is a pain with this phone. It seems that you need to carry a stylus with you to be able to txt and move around the menus. It has good features but the touch screen problem makes it very difficult and frustrating to use. If you want to send txt quickly, this is not the phone for you.
In addition, I recently added an unlimited data plan. Thats when I decided that I need to get rid of the phone. Battery life is very poor when using the browser and it will run out on you in minutes if you use youtube. Scrolling in a web page is almost impossible, again the difficulty with the touch screen. Now that I have unlimited internet I decided to get rid of the phone and buy an iPhone, even if it costs me full price. The important thing is to get rid of this phone asap!

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,"i agree with the others about the responsiveness of the touch screen and the volume (very good). i use an old-school plantronics headset with it and it only drops the signal on occasion. that being said, here are a few caveats that are not really dealbreakers but they can be irritating after a while:

1. if you dial voice mail right after a missed call, the voice mail number replaces that number on the call list. it looks like you can call them right back by using the touch screen but in fact it dials voice mail instead. if the number isn't elsewhere on your phone this can be inconvenient (while driving, for example).
2. if you want to return to the ""mute"" screen after dialing into a conference call you have to backspace thru the numbers you keyed in.
3. there is not a conference call feature to add someone to the conversation if someone else calls you on the other line.
4. you cannot set the alarm while the phone is silent if you don't want to be awakened by phone calls.

the vu is still a nice, low-cost alternative to the iPhone if you don't need all the bells and whistles but my next touch screen phone will have at least one of these issues remedied!",219,18

I have been a very satisfied T-Mobile customer for 5 years before switching to AT&T.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!  The only reasons why I switched to AT&T are rollover minutes and corporate discount  (which I haven't seen)

On the Phone:
1. battery life is VERY short.  even after turning off 3G mode, battery life is far from what i want it to be
2. charging takes a long time
3. sometimes there's a lag time between touches
4. key pad isn't as accurate as Blackberry's (i guess you get what you pay for)
5. bad design on the location of the memory card and bad design on the charge/headphone connector
6. reception sucks!  and occasionally you'll get ""no service available"" at places where you normally get reception. (this could be on AT&T network, but then this phone comes with AT&T services so....)

On AT&T:
- BAD customer service
- BAD reception
- WATCH YOUR BILL!!!  tried to bill me something that i didn't subscribe.  also tried to charge me something that I have cancelled one week before the free trial period ended (citing that the change didn't show up on their system until a week after the trial ended).
- corporate discount: it's been four months and i still don't see it.  customer rep just kept on telling me that it'll show up on the next bill.

The buttom line:
I can't wait for AT&T contract to end and go back to T-Mobile and a phone that's not made by LG.",258,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,"Hi,

I bought this phone from Amazon 9 months back and paid 50 bucks. I choose this because of touch screen which doesn't required data plan. This is my first touch screen phone and worked nice for 3months and then touch screen stopped responding. I got annoyed and called amazon customer service and they responded by replacing the phone but got latter got letter saying they can't do that. I called them multiple times and told to contact ATT and did the same but ATT said since I have no insurance they can't do anything. I started using my old razr v3 which still works and now waiting for next upgrade from ATT.",113,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,"I previously had the LG Shine, I really liked the phone but my 2 yr old broke it.  It didn't break my heart because I really wanted a phone with a qwerty keyboard for texting, and I was eligible for upgrade.  Since I was very pleased with the Shine, I decided to stick with LG and go for the Vu.  I am VERY displeased with the camera on this phone!  Everything is blurry, unless you are able to be perfectly still and in perfect lighting. I have adjusted settings, nothing seems to help.  If someone can offer tips, it would be appreciated.  The Shine had an excellent camera, that even had flash.  Having a toddler, I love this feature, it assures I don't miss any special moments just because I don't have my camera with me.

The touch screen works fine and reception is good.  Which are the most important things in a phone.  Battery life is a little less than the shine, but the screen is bigger, brighter and the keyboard vibrates I would assume that would take more energy.

I am also very disapointed with the ringtone capability on this phone.  Ringtones that I was able to use before on the Shine, are too large to be used as ringtones on the Vu?!!  Why would LG do this?

Overall, it's a phone.  It's good for talking and texting. If you aren't interested in the camera or having a wide variety of ringtones... this is a really good phone.  It just seems that instead of improving on what they already had right, LG took a step back with the ""features"" on this phone. Can't quite understand that.  This will probably be my last LG phone.",286,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,2.0,negative,"I had this phone since Sept'08 to March'09. Initially I liked this phone very much  since it had ATT live TV but that's the only selling point of this phone. The touchscreen is resistive and most of the time one has to tap more than one time to use the feature and being resistive screen, it has overall dark contrast.
Coming to battery life, it is very very bad..I mean very very bad. ATT TV finishes battery so fast that one can't imagine. If one is using headsets to watch ATT TV then one can't charge the phone. Since both charger and headset uses proprietary port of LG. Music is of worst quality, one can only use LG headset since it has proprietary port and the music quality is very bad and sound is way too low.
No Wifi is also a big time disappointment, one has to depend on ATT Medianet to use internet on the phone, plus no GPS also dampens the use of this phone.
I paid 179.99 before 50$ rebate with contract extension and I feel totally disappointed, ebay-ed this phone for 160$ and bought a new Nokia N85 which is 1000 times better than this touchscreen phone.

Positive reviews you might have already read it and if you have never experienced touchscreen before, you might like it too but my suggestion is to go to a store and try it and try other touchscreen phones too before ordering it online.",245,22

My only problem with the phone is when I'm scrolling through my contact list the scroll function gets overzealous, often shooting me far past my desired selection. Other than that, the touch screen is near perfect, the camera functionality is great (even without the flash), and the audio clarity is amazing with either a Bluetooth headset or just the phone.",116,23

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,"I bought two of these phones, one for myself and one for my husband when we signed up with AT&T a few months ago.  We had studied phones and decided these were the ones we wanted.  Overall, it is a good phone but not great.  I like the touchscreen and have not had any problems with it like some others have had.  The size is good as it's not too big or too small.  The icons are nice and easy to access however, I wish that I could somehow customize the icons (get rid of some and move others).  Another con would be that if you are in sunlight, the screen is almost impossible to see and where I live it is sunny all the time so it can be a pain.  There is a brightness setting on the phone but it does not help when in the sun.  I also wish that the case was not plastic.  It comes across as cheap and has the ability to scratch easily.  I definitely recommend getting a screen protector and a case to protect all aspects of the phone.  The sound is good except that when I am speaking, it sounds like I am talking into a wall.  It does not seem that it is going through the phone.  I am still trying to get used to that.  Saying that though, it does have good sound coming through the other end of the phone and nobody has complained about hearing me.

Now for the problems!

For awhile after we got it, the phone would die anytime it was off the charger. AT&T sent a replacement but by the time it got here, the old one was back to working. REALLY not sure what was wrong initially.

So that problem was resolved but after that, anyone who called my husband couldn't hear a word he said, just the loudest static/windy sound in the world. He is not rough on his phone...he really doesn't even use it much...so that caused our second replacement by AT&T.

Other major issue that we didn't like is that the memory card (which you purchase separately) goes UNDER the battery, which means every time you take the card out or put it in, the phone dies...

We had this phone for 9 months and had to call warranty twice, and each time it took up to a week to get them to send the replacement. Definitely not worth the hassle. I have an LG Shine that I got at the same time, and it's been perfect (and was cheaper). The third time it broke was 8 months after we got it. It just stopped turning on completely, regardless of if it was plugged into the charger or not. We gave up and got a $20 Nokia phone that has been a million times better.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,5.0,positive,"I bought this phone a few days ago and so far have been very happy with it.

The phone feels light, but sturdy.

It looks pretty good, but I would suggest getting some sort of case, or Invisible shield, as haphazardly throwing it in a purse or pocket with other items can cause unwanted scratches.

Despite qualms I've heard about the battery life, I haven't noticed anything below average.

The touchscreen is quite responsive, but does have a bit of a learning curve. After a few days you'll be a pro though. The qwerty keyboard is surprisingly easy to use, considering its size.

If you want to be able to play with cool games or apps this phone is surprisingly modable. I'd suggest anyone who gets this phone heads over to [...]. There you'll find lots of guides and how to's on making your phone perfect.

One of the things I was surprised about was the difference in speed. I Upgraded to this phone from a Razr V3 and didn't realize how much of a speed boost 3g gives. Even SMS's go through faster.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,4.0,positive,"I really like this phone. I commute, and the picture quality when watching TV is really good. The screen vibrates slightly when you touch it so you know you connected with your target (there wasn't the learning curve I expected with a touch screen). The web browser is very good, and you can switch from portrait to landscape, and from qwerty to standard keypad at the touch of a button. The Mobile Email feature lacks Gmail for some reason, although gmail is easily accessed through the web browser. I have paired and uploaded pictures and files easily with this device and my bluetooth enabled PC, although it does not sync with Outlook Calendar or gmail calendar if that is an issue for you. The only unfavorable comment I have is that when I first got the phone, it would shutoff randomly. Upon searching the web I found a thread that pinned this problem down to some SD cards used in the phone (I had purchased a 2G Kingston miniSD card). Once I removed it, the problem ceased. Therefor it seems that there is an incompatability problem with some brands of microSDs. If anyone can recommend a miniSD card that they know works, I would be appreciative as I would hate to buy another only to find out it causes the same issue.",222,29

- Why do people keep comparing this phone to an I-phone?  If you had an I-phone, why would you downgrade to an LG Vu?  I've never owned an I-phone, but I assume it's the cat's meow of cell phones, so don't put this phone down because it's not the same as an I-phone.  This phone may not be as expensive as an I-phone, but at least you won't be forced to purchase a more expensive data plan (with AT&T, unlimited data plans for I-phones is $20 more than unlimited data plan for the LG Vu).
- Yes, the battery life could be better but if you're not constantly websurfing, playing games, emailing, and talking on the phone for hours and hours then the battery life isn't bad.  So, even though the phone comes with a charger, I purchased a universal charger so that I can charge my phone through my pc and my vehicle.  Now I can charge up my phone anywhere and anytime.
Overall, this is a fun phone that keeps me entertained. If you get this phone, you'll need a data cable because aparently LG didn't think a multimedia phone should have included a data cable; this is my only con with this phone (I wish cell phone companies would stop nickel-and-diming customers!).  Also, get a memory card and a silicon case (the phone shows smudges and fingerprints very easily).

-I go on the internet, surf, write my emails with ease, text with ease. -
-The touch QWERTY keyboard option makes it quicker to do so.
-The buttons are normal size, but if you do have ginormous fingers, you will encounter annoyances typing the wrong key(as you would with any other touchscreen).
-the display has great colors
-video/tv shows great and fluidly
-the camera is OK, not the best, but its not advertised as a digital cam, so no big deal
I don't appreciate the comparison to the iphone because ""DUHH!""- its not an iphone.

2. Select Modem Settings
3. Select Network Mode
4. Select Network Mode (again)

Again the MicroSD works great on the other CU920.

Even re-calibrated, the precision and consistent sensitivity of the touch screen is far from iPhone and iTouch. Dial someone in the contact list is fine, but if you dial through the pad for some codes and phone numbers, you are very likely to mistype or double type digits.

Today I found one pin of connector of the earphone was bent. The tiny design of the connector is prone to damage. And when you has the connector on, it is really hard to adjust the volume since the connector blocks half the side button for volume adjustment.

LCD quality/size...seems better than average

Cons:
Will just list the biggest ones since there are so many:

call quality is awful...hiss in background on every call

3g is terrible (faster on other 3g phones I have tried), even when I get all bars ...this could be related to the fact that the phone itself is slow...

Hangs up quite a bit with internet connections, mail

touch screen is terrible...impossible to scroll using the screen, you have to use the bars on the side, otherwise you will most likely SELECT instead of scroll.  Needs some MAJOR haptics work here.

Where the f is the headphones jack?  Obviously not standard... -50 points there.  Good lord.

Battery life if you even view a couple of CNN videos...completely shot.  So to use the phone to watch anything, you better be plugged in somewhere.

Phone LOCKS while you are calling!  This is insanely annoying.  Esp when At&T for instance prompts you to PRESS 4 for customer service.  Wow...who designed that?!

Can't use the great qwerty keyboard to input contacts!  wtf!?  I actually like the QWERTY keyboard on the Vu, but you rarely get to use it.

The phone seemed pretty good the first day I got it, but the longer I used it the worse it got.

The touch screen works well for me, and call quality is very good and the speakerphone is great. The best feature is when pressing one button the time and date flash on screen in large letters unlike other phones I used before.
What I don't like about the phone is that it takes many steps to get where you want e.g. speed dial...several steps; switching between two calls also it takes 3 steps. The signal works in some areas in my house while another phone works in all areas. All in all, I like using it.",108,48

I can only put the phone on vibrate or ringtone, not both. When it is on either, I can not hear or feel it when someone calls and it's in my pocket.

Even though most camera phones have a two mega pixel or more camera, this phone is set apart by the extreme color in the pictures. The camera on this is better than my Sony digital camera!

I would have given this phone 5 stars, but there are definate problems with the battery life and charge meter. The phones meter will show a full charge and 1 phone call will drop it to low battery, There doesn't seem to be an in between. I did get 2-3 days on a full charge with regular phone usage. New phones use a Li-Ion Battery that don't have memory cells and can be charged anytime without fully draining the battery. I simply charge the phone everynight to avoid the issues with draining the battery.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0018OKDNG,3.0,neutral,"Just got this little LG, and here are my thoughts.
-Very clear voice calls
-Great speaker and the people on the other end can't tell I'm on the speaker while I am driving
-The touch screen is really bright,and pictures show great
-Getting used to the touch screen, but the feedback feature is really handy for me
-Reception so far has been great, only one lost call in an area that I know is a deadspot
-Didn't think I'd care for the TV feature, but it is very cool, and great for killing time at airports and while visiting my mom who doesn't have a tv in the spare rooms. The screen is really sharp and the picture really shows well, even if a bit small.

Like I said, so far, so good...the only negatives are: the world time doesn't adjust automatically when I reach a foreign country and as a result I can't use the phone as my alarm clock abroad (that is a very useful feature on a lot of phones), I also cannot use my recordings from my music downloads or voice recordings as my ringtones, and last but not least is that there is no flash on the camera (but I knew that before I got the phone).

Overall, I am very satisfied with it as a phone, which is why I NEED it. All the extra stuff, to me is just that...extra. This may keep me as an AT&T customer.",245,56

 I have changed my mind because of the storage capacity, if they can build ipods with 16GB of memory or very cheap new 16GB MP3 and camera touch screen players for under a $100 bucks. (V-Touch 8GB MP3/MP4 2.8"" Touchscreen $69) or ( Topguide 16GB MP4/MP3/ FM/Voice w/3.0"" Touchscreen $99) Why purchase a phone that has very little memory. I have had many phones since moble phones have come out,  back in the early 90's spending $7000 a year on cell phones was a normal thing for me, versus $800 now.
 I am getting a little tired of breaking in new phones, so in the last year I had to buy in a hurry and got a cheap $20 Go phone and love it. No frills but it does the job.
 When they come out with a phone with 16-32gb MEMORY plus expansion with the same. I can carry all of my photos-music-files etc with me. If you would see the amount of computers, cameras, hard drives and all the electronics, I own, it would mind boggle you. I have spent well over $25,000 since 1994 in computers and related electronics.
 I want to down size and have everything compact in one little unit, to make it very simple, so I can have the time to do a little fishing and still show another fisherman some of the photos I have of the big fish I used to catch and anything else i need to access.

* Touch Screen with haptic feedback. Great feature.

can't sync with PC (Calendar, Contacts, backup) - no PC Suite for CU920 / 915

poor reception - again vs Nokia 6230
3G unstable and eat battery fast
no onfly recording when you need it - in Nokia you just press a button and voice recording starts

There's not much to add in the area of Pros and Cons. Everyone's just about covered the:

Great Screen, a little dim in full daylight, but very responsive.
My call quality is better than my HTC Tilt, reception better as well.
QWERTY keyboard is fantastic.
Very snappy interface.

The Cons that people are mentioning:

Battery life. Any 3G phone has a reduced battery life.

Here's how to turn off 3G on the Vu if you don't plan on using it.

1. Dial 277634#*# on the keypad to access the Test Menu
2. Select Modem Settings
3. Select Network Mode
4. Select Network Mode (again)
5. Select what bands you wish to be active. (select 2G if you want to make the 3G searching stop. This is what reduces battery life.)
6. Press the Clear/Back button until you return to the main screen

Shutting off 3G just about doubles the battery life. Also, someone said there is no charging indicator, that's wrong. It's right on the screen. Hopefully someone will make a hack to give percentages.",208,68

one weird thing that no one else seems to mention in the reviews: they ask for your social security number to verify your account and status of upgrade. i felt wary to enter that on the internet, but everything seems to be ok.

11/11/08 Update:
It is not very friendly to use when you can't focus your entire attention to the phone... especially when driving.  With a phone with buttons, you can feel around and navigate contacts with ease.  With this phone, you have to be looking at it in order to make the proper selection, and make sure you are pressing the right ""button"".  It's also not very friendly when you have to switch calls for call waiting.  I've also had it call my voicemail randomly if I've got a message, or if I'm intentionally dialing for my messages, it dials again and says ""I'm sorry, someone is already accessing this mailbox"" then I have to end that call, switch to my original, and my message is halfway done playing. Weird.

Also annoying when you have to dial numbers in a voice menu.  The screen locks quickly so that your cheek doesn't hit a wrong button, but then you have to press the unlock button every time to navigate the menu.

Still overall a nice phone.  and now that it is down to 1 penny? How can you go wrong?",292,79

*You can use a stylus although I recommend a screen protector if you do

*Volume is loud
*Mobile TV works well

Cons:
*No 3.5mm headphone jack ( I can't even begin to explain how annoying that is for a so-called MEDIA phone)

*At&t fills the phone with tons of applications and other stuff that you can't delete
*Battery life is pretty awful

This last order contained the same bluetooth, except this particular seller apparently dismantled the packaging so as to send me only the bluetooth itself and exactly one earloop (luckily it fits) and one cushion for the ear itself (again, luckily, it also fits). I did not expect that the seller would be so cheesy as to remove all the other loops and cushions which I received with my two previous orders, which had come in their original packaging. Most times, a discounted item is discounted because it is slightly out of date, but contains all the items supplied by the manufacturer in its original packaging. I certainly did not expect this order to come like this -- the pictured item is not accurate, since the gold loop was removed, presumably to be sold separately to someone else.  It is advertised to be sold in the retail packaging and this clearly was not!  I like the Jawbone, but I feel like I was ripped off by this seller.

First, the headset takes some effort to position correctly so as to obtain the help of the noiseAssassin technology. It took me a few tries to get it right. Second, the ear piece is not very comfortable to wear for long periods of time because its speaker presses on the outside of the ear canal rather than nestling inside it like most earbuds. However, the advantage to this design is that you do not feel deaf in one ear while driving because some sound can still make it to your ear. Also on the plus side, the bluetooth connects quickly and effortlessly and has not failed once. The buttons take some practice to get used to but work well once you understand them.

DSP was sufficient enough to talk in a busy street. Not sure it will work ok on a construction site like in their advertisement.

Most reviews discussed ways to tackle these problems and I ordered this headset.

I'm quite happy with my headset from the variety of ear pieces provided to make the fit more comfortable, to the sound quality of this device (excellent on both ends of the conversation). I had no difficulty in pairing it with my cell. It took a few times to get used to the light touch that's needed for the device when answering calls or adjusting the NoiseAssassin, however, it's no different than the headset device I use at work.

Friends were able to spot the small light on the piece when I turned it toward them when I was on a call. And I prefer not to have a glaring light out of the corner of my eyes.

I highly recommend this device over a few others that I've tried in recent years for the voice and sound quality alone. It's also light weight, easy to use, and attractive to boot. Take some time to familiarize yourself on how deft of touch you need in answering calls and adjusting the sound, otherwise I've not had any problems with this device.",237,48

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,1.0,negative,"Pretty to look at and when it actually stays in your ear, it does cancel excess noise.

However, the key is staying in your ear, and touching your jawbone.  Forget it.  I liked the product but could not stand the fall out, not working, buttons in wrong places when you tried to make the thing stay in your ear. Great advertisement, poor engineering.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001AVXON8,2.0,negative,"After 9 months of using the JawboneII, I have to give it a middling score overall. The earbuds that came with it were completely worthless, and I have now broken the last earloop. So I'm back to using my Motorola H710. I had forgotten what a good fit it was! No more worrying that when I take it off or put it on, I'll bend the earloop too far and break it. The only thing the Jawbone has in it's favor is the noise-cancelling. Besides inadvertantly ending calls when the thing threatens to drop off my ear, I would also get a strange noise sometimes when attempting to answer a call (kind of like the noise you hear when tightening guitar strings).

Too bad they did such a terrible job in the fitting department. I even purcased the eargels on Amazon after breaking the first loop or two, trying to get it to fit better.",155,58

You press it down and wait 2 seconds, but you can't really tell if you've held it down long enough or not. They could improve it by adding a tiny button or switch or something.  Also the connection to the cell phone randomly turns on and off. This is very frustrating.

I've tried all of the ear pieces, but none placed Jawbone properly in my ear so I can hear well.  People I talk to say they can't hear because my voice breaks up.  When I push the location of the noise abatement, it turns off the unit and I lose my call.  Because it is too loose in my ear. I have to hold the little microphone against my face so people can hear me.  If I have to bend over, it comes loose and sometimes fall off.  I'm disappointed in a product that started out good.

However, several people, including myself, have noticed that it is better to turn off noise canceling unless you are in a noisy environment or it seems to cause it to cut out.  I did not find the fit to my ear to be particularly great so I hold the unit to my face when noise canceling is turned on.  The big problem for me is that the range on this unit is really a lot worse than my other headsets. I also wanted to use it with Skype and other computer based communications, and on a new Mac and a few different newer PC's the static was bad,  so I got a Callpod Drone.  This really helped but the range is still bad so I might as well be using a corded headset.  The killer for me was that the battery was weak and would not hold a charge so I have to return the unit.

Now for the drawbacks...The fit is not at all any better or worse than the Jawbone I...the earloops are plastic and flimsy and do not provide for a snug fit in any case...the earpieces come in small, medium, & large which is better than the odd-fitting ones in the Jawbone I...it is very easy to disconnect a call while trying to move the Jawbone II around for a better fit...and it does not hold to the face quite as well as the Jawbone I...but that may be because it is smaller, lighter, and has a more delicate earloop. Overall, the technology is state of the industry...It works really well on both ends of the call; it just needs a better earloop and earpiece system. Before I bought the Jawbone II, I read the reviews on Amazon.com and I also purchased the AcoustiBuds earpieces for the Jawbone II. They are an aftermarket product that fits over the original earpieces that come with the Jawbone II and they do actually provide for a better fit when added the the earpieces that come with the Jawbone II.

I tried Aliph's ""new"" ear-buds. I tried their old ones. I tried an idea from something else I read, the Jabra ear-gels ... Now that did make the Jawbone-II tend to stay in the ear more often. And it did keep that ""Noise Assassin"" part of the Jawbone-II firmly against my cheek (for  a while) However, it was annoying to the ear after a half-hour.

And equally annoying was the fact that the Answer/Disconnect/Shut-off ""Switch"" is ever so easily activated every single time I tried to adjust the earpiece whilst it was in the ear.

And, referring to that infernal Answer/Disconnect/Shut-off toggle, if one had it in one's pocket, turned on, and a call came in, grabbing it from the trousers did switch it off and disconnected the call.

And finally, I happened to be testing my newly purchased Jawbone-II on freezing morning. I had it in the ear and on a call. A swift breeze started up and I pulled a wool ""Watch Cap"" down over my ears. It's not a particularly tight one I own either. That action, the watch cap touching the Jawbone-II, killed the call.

You'd think that after 38 years of marriage, I would have known she did not want something sticking in her ear.  I convinced her to try it and she did, for a week.  I then got her a motorola H800-B slider which she loves.  I inherited the Jawbone since my plantronics 510 had worn out.
  I originally thought I would have problems with the little bud hitting my cheek, since I have a full beard, but there was no problem.  I used the Jabra earbuds with this set to fit my ear better and they make this an almost perfect unit.  I drive an 18-wheeler all week and this really helps people hear me better over all of the cab noise, which is significant in an older truck. The distance problem some others have is not an issue since the phone (LG VX-9800) hangs on a clip above the windshield.  If I am not in the truck the phone is on my belt.
  All in all, I am glad I made the mistake in the gift.  I never would have spent this much on a set for myself, but it was well worth the money.  Make sure you get the Jabra eargels though, they are 100% better than the OEM rubbers that came with the phone.  I generally have my headset on for most of the day I am driving/working (10 to 14 hours) and I forget it's there.

Also, I have to turn toward the phone in order for the signal to be stronger even when I am next to the phone - if I block the signal with my body I get bad quality sound. In fact, since I don't have a car and mainly wanted this for use around my (small) house, it has been a big disappointment to me. I am barely using it.

My advice: if you do alot of driving, then this will work well for you as you can leave your phone in one position relative to the headset and the sound quality will remain okay. Or if you have a circular house and can leave the phone in the middle point!

I drove on the highway at 70mph alternately raising and lowering my window, and my friend couldn't tell the difference.  I sounded completely clear to him in both cases -- clearer than when I was just using my phone inside my apartment!

Just to be clear, the jawbone doesn't claim to make the other person sound clear to you, rather it makes you sound clear to the other person.  so if you couldn't hear the other person on your phone before, the jawbone isn't going to help you much.  it does let you choose from several volume options, some which get quite loud and actually hurts my ears.  Because you have to scroll through the volume settings (you can't just choose the one you want, and you can't go backwards on the list)  I've found the best solution is to leave it on its quietest setting and set the bluetooth volume through my KRZR's bluetooth volume settings.

Sometimes I get static and lose signal if the phone is out of line of sight of the earpiece, including if it's in my pants pocket on the other side of my body.  but i think this is because the krzr's bluetooth signal is not that strong.  My friend with an HTC touch phone has no problems with his jawbone losing connection with his phone.  I can walk pretty far away from my phone without static occuring if the jawbone maintains a line of sight connection with it.

Pushing the button on the headset to make the call is still something I'm trying to figure out -- I've mostly had to open my phone and do the dialing there. Other headsets I've had make it a lot easier to make a call. Also, the noise assassin feature works when it's on, but it's hard to tell whether it's on or off. There's not much of an indication.

Pros:

1. Smaller
2. Better fitting than original
3. SUPER SEXY!
4. fits in the pocket easier
5. Charges SUPER FAST
6. Light as air

Cons:

1. Loop broke within 1 week (no shocker, old style broke fast too)
2. Battery goes dead insanely fast, cant make it half the day!
3. Range is HORRIBLE (less than half the old version ""about 5 feet clear 10ft scratchy with my Iphone 3G""
4. I think you have to turn on noise cancel every time,, or I'm doing something wrong.
5. Its almost too light! You forget you have it in your ear.

SUMMARY: This is an improvement over the old Jawbone which killed my ear, broke ear loops constantly,,, However, the decrease in range and battery life is a real killer. Be prepared to buy more earloops, complain to the company, and maybe even turn on the noise cancelling.

This Belkin armband piece is rugged and sporty.  It is made of high-quality plastic and elastic materials.
The three main components, the iPhone pocket, the cord control mechanism, and the arm clip, seem to be durable.

The plastic cover on the iPhone pocket will need cleaning every once in a while if using in the gym regularly, but this is understandable.

One lowlight: the entire armband seems to be a bit finicky, requiring attention throughout one's workout.

I can run with it, lift weights, and have it chilling on my arm normally. Insertion and removal of your iPhone should be done very carefully and not forcefully.

If you take the armband and put it on, it feels *fairly* secure.  Add an iPhone 3GS and very quickly you realize what a waste of money this would be.  It flops up and down and the arm band wiggles it's way down your arm unless you have it tight enough to constrict the blood flow, at which point you're at risk of fainting during exercise :-)

I had the Nike+ neoprene armband for my nano when I used the old sport kit and the velcro fastener and neoprene combo made it easy to wrap firmly around your arm, partially waterproofing the nano but also securing it completely.

Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch. It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly. For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up. But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned. Also, around hole where the iPhone goes in, there's a thin strip of what appears to be paper that's glued around the mouth is located.

I also love the clip feature instead of the velcro (what others use). It allows for armband adjustment ahead of time, and the clip seems to keep the armband snugly around the arm.

There are two reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars:
1. The phone holding pocket ""jumps"" around a bit while running and bouncing since it's not snugly attached to the armband but uses the belt clip instead. However, after about 6 months of use it never has fallen out. It's ust a minor annoyance.
2. The iPhone touchscreen can sometimes be slightly unresponsive through the plastic, but I've only noticed that when my hands are very sweaty or wet.

The fastener took a little getting used to but once I got the hang of it, it was cake.

However last week I treated myself to an iPad and bought a cradlepoint portable router (PHS 300). A great little device that allowed me to attach the 598U so that I wouldn't have to fork over another $30 to AT&T. The speed has tripled since setting it up through the cradlepoint device, not just for the ipad but for my laptop!

I set up my email and it failed numerous times - would not automatically send/receive without going thru hoops.  Anything sent was visible for < 1 hr and anything received was also visible for ~ 1 hr.  There was no auto-delete function invoked.

I was on the phone with AT&T for > 6 hrs over the course of the last two weeks.  They agreed there was a problem.  I took it into an AT&T store where their store management reproduced the problems (down to the last one) and said he agreed too.

I replaced it (paying the difference in $) with a Blackberry Torch.  I've now had it 3 weeks (The Torch) and have had ZERO problems and have not had a need to call tech support, not even once.

* Screen tilts - helpful to reduce glare
* Create ringtones on the fly by choosing a song and right clicking - without additional cost

Helpful tips for Windows Mobile

Periodically Windows Mobile devices experience registry corruption.  The best resolution is to perform a hard reset on the device clearing out the memory and essentially freshly building the device.  By doing these periodic resets (in my experience 2 times a year is necessary), the device remains responsive and less buggy.

There is a lot of functionality built into the Tilt that is handy.  It is one of the better Windows devices for navigation.  Using a bluetooth GPS bug the device can do quite well guiding without the necessity of having to buy a singletasking handheld navigation system.",226,2

It's almost like BAIT & SWITCH by AT&T. They stop ""carrying"" the particular expensive phone in less than a year so when the phone dies in a few months AT&T won't have to exchange it with a new one for you... but they got your contract for 2 years... with a cheaper phone in exchange. Before wasting your money on a new expensive AT&T smartphone, ask yourself if you're ok with having to warranty exchange your new phone with a USED refurbished one in less than a year.",108,4

Wrong! The Tilt 2 is/has -

  > Poor keyboard layout.

  > Stupid magnet in stylus. Really? I'd like to slap the engineer that thought of this. You'll see the issue when you've got a case with a magnetic catch.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,2.0,negative,"Unfortunately, this item doesn't comply to the ISO double-DIN standard as well as one would hope.  The standard width is supposed to be 180mm.  My head unit has a big screen in addition to knobs that go right up within 1/32"" of the edge of the unit.  This Metra harness doesn't fit over the knobs (which are inside the overall profile - they don't stick out), so there's no way to get the bracket onto the head unit.  The head unit's listed width is 180mm, which comes out to about 7 3/32 inches.  I measured this kit's internal window width to be about 6 13/16.  Close, but no cigar.

It's worth noting that many American manufacturers modify the ISO measurements to be 7"" x 4"".  Taking that into account, 6 13/16 isn't an egregious miscalculation - likely an intentional decision to make the mount fit right up against the control interface of American-made head units which may have some black space around the edges.

With my Japanese head unit's strict compliance to the ISO standard and controls extending right up to the edge, there's just not room in this bracket.

Just make sure that your head unit will fit in this bracket, and you should be golden.  Seems to be made of your standard hard plastic (kinda close to ABS but not quite), and of solid quality.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0021K4ISC,4.0,positive,"It's a multi-kit, as such there's enough variability in it that it'll probably work fine for your application. A couple of items to keep in mind though. First off, after it's in, it is secure enough. Just don't expect a rock-solid mounting. Typically the plastic has some give to it so you'll have to persuade it into the position you need. This can be a positive of course, as that bit of flexibility will be what you'll need to mount your unit squarely. Second, the tabs are not pre-cut or scored. Since it's a multi-kit, you'll have to remove the majority of tabs that come on the brackets. I used a plastic welder to just slice them off. You'll be fine using either a small saw or jigsaw. Just remember that you won't be able to just snap these off. This is really what makes it better than most multi-kits I've used before.

The directions aren't the best; I actually had to cut more of the plastic off than it shows in the manual for my install. I cut off the plastic pieces I didn't need, but then I also took a dremel and smoothed down the areas where I had cut so nothing would catch the sides as I slid it into the dash. For my install, I didn't need the front bezel.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,2.0,negative,The white version of this product produces a white haze on pictures taken with flash due to the cutout design. It does not integrate w/ built in iPhone functions such as auto correct and tapping space bar twice for period. It is a great conversation starter and it does provide a full screen for typing but once you try to use it it makes for harder typing. The trade off is not worth it. Why this item was on back order for 3 weeks is beyond me. The folks at Apple had it right the first time!,97,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002959MS0,3.0,neutral,"I've had an iPod touch since its release in 2007, so I've grown quite accustomed to the on screen keyboard of apple products. But, after I had such a good experience with the Bluetooth keyboard for the iPad2 (I own the Zagg/Logitech brand one) I thought this maybe a good idea.

While I don't hate the product, I can honestly say I'm not entirely satisfied.

Pros:
The most obvious pro about this is that it's a full physical keyboard. If you type in landscape mode, then you already know how much screen real estate you lose when you're typing, making it difficult to see. Having the physical keyboard gives you back all that screen space.

So really... if you're big on text messaging, you're totally gonna dig this product.

The battery life of it is actually really good and you can go for quite some time without having to charge the thing. Considering the keys are backlit while typing, this is a plus.

Cons:
The construction of this  product is pretty brittle. The keyboard itself is not flush with the assembly and feels like if you were too rough with it, the keyboard would fly right off.

Another gripe I have is the placement of the buttons. While it's a complete QWERTY keyboard, the problem likes in the key placement. After extensive use you'll come to the realization that you're force to shift your thumbs more to the right. I found myself making more mistakes than I would like because of this. But, it's easily overcome with time and patience.

Overall:
It's a good idea, really. Like I said, I don't hate the product. It just feels like it could have been done a little bit better.",287,2

However, with this, I'd have to remove it each and every time to dock it....which is not too easy. Also what another reviewer said about the flash is absolutely right. Even while taking pictures with QWERTY open, the picture still comes out unclear and hazy. Other than these two reasons, its pretty great....just not great enough for me.

When taking flash photography it doesn't work!  I think this problem may only be related to the white case as it is flashing back the white surrounding the camera/flash.  I tested my theory by placing black tape along the inside around the camera/flash and my rudimentary solution, at best, worked somewhat (couldn't get the tape to fit exactly)... the picture was actually visible.  So, if you want the prettiness of just plain white - you are stuck with just taking non-flash photography... or take the phone out of the case whenever you want to take flash photography (which is easier said than done... could be nail breaking in my case!)

So this means that every night (obviously not texting in my sleep so it is not being used), the bluetooth disconnects. Also this happens during the day if I am not constantly using it. Very annoying!

In fact, I received a comment the first night having it at a restaurant. So my point is, it's quite a good conversation starter.

But then when he started using it we both noticed a problem with the ""S"" key.  At first it just seemed a little sticky and added a ton of ""s""s whenever he touched it (example: ""thankssssssssssssssssss..."") Then a few hours later it just stopped working entirely.

Do not put it next to any pens, pencils, markers, or crayons. Even with the slightest dot of those and it will be on there PERMANENTLY, no matter how much you clean it even with a hard soap scrub. Secondly the led backlighting is a fail. The light is only supposed to shine through the keys but the plastic the keys are placed in is very thin so you can see the lights glowing through the plastic everywhere in weird places giving a bade effect. Another problem with the Led backlighting is that you have to press a key to light it up temporarily. A better way to have the lights turn on and off is to have a trigger when you slide the keyboard in an out. The problem I have with the above issue is that when I am in a dark place, lets say at night in bed, I cant see the keys so I have to press them randomly to light it up and then delete those characters I pressed again.

- white finish is EXTREMELY prone to marks or stains. Got it's first stain within the first 3 minutes of having it. NO THANK YOU.
- Not enough room for your thumb to easily access the top row of keys
- Keys do not provide much tactile feedback; have to press kind of hard to get the letters to register
- Angle at which it holds the phone in relation to the keyboard is awkward... almost like the phone is tilted back a little bit too much

Overall, as some other reviewers have stated, this keyboard does add some bulk to the phone. I think this should be expected from an add-on keyboard such as this. I would say that the added bulk was NOT an issue for me, and if you are hesitant about buying this keyboard for that reason, you should not let that consideration affect your purchase decision.

For the usability issues bulleted above, I would rate this item as a DO NOT BUY unless there is some reason that you absolutely cannot live without the physical keyboard. Other than that, the iPhone's mediocre (and free) on-screen keyboard provides a much more friendly experience.",238,39

Using it to type this review, and since ive owned a boxwave keyboard prior to using this one, im used to the keyboard layout.

added features: lock button. Nothing too special about this for me since im used too locking my phone after closing the keyboard.
"" "" : one press function lock: takes some time getting used to but better for typing number strings.
"" "" : grips on f and j keys for more accurate typing

pros:
finally backlit! also has a button to turn of backlight for when you don't need it.
overall same keyboard layout. some keys have moved but better overall for typing.

cons:
white model has issues with photography and flash. considering painting the inside cutout black. could have been tested for this issue.
white model can also get very dirty and cleaning can be an issue. after two weeks the edges are browning due to the soft plastic material.
removed keyboard music controls! one of my favorite features of the original has dissapeared!

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,3.0,neutral,"Pros: Creative use of buttons, big screen, qwerty keyboard
Cons: Doesn't sync with Outlook, clunky user interface, muddled audio in ear piece/speakerphone

I really have to give credit to Samsung because of the creatively designed keypad, but I don't recommend this phone overall. The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.)

I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend.  I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page.

Pros:
I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus.
The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time.
The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails.
It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will.
The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures.
The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode.
It's easy to use.
Sound quality is good.
Nice long life of battery charge.

Cons:
The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change.
Some functions are difficult to find on the menus.  That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu.
The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring.
There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone.  (ETA:  Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light.  Duh.)

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0029F2O3A,2.0,negative,"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place.

Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad).

I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original. I will keep my new every 2 discount until Verizon comes out with a very good Android or Apple finally relents with the iphone/At&T exclusivity.",273,13

The feeling in the ears is a little heavy then normal. Guys with larger canals will not notice much but those with smaller canals would find them a little uncomfortable. One of the strange things about Bluetooth and plugged ear phones of course is fidelity of the sound and when you wear these Sony headset sealed in your ears you get some pretty decent sound not the typical high end fidelity you expect from most plugged ear sets. I currently use the headset with my new iPhone 3G S and they work outstanding with a distance of about 20 feet from the iPhone. The audio for music and podcast is prefect for me.

Ease of use and technology wise they are great/slick headphones. Phone calls are clear and the way it switches automatically from music to a call is great. Bluetooth discovery was a breeze to HTC phone.

Sound quality of music is awful. Music sounds like I am playing AM music in a can, there is no bass.  The earbuds that came with my old Blackberry sound better, I compared them. What a disappointment. I looked all around the headphones for a bass button or something that would help. Nothing. Please tell me if I missed it.

Fit
The buds do not fit in my ear securely. I tried all the size adapters, no good. I stuffed them as deeply in my ears as possible for a secure fit and for some semblance of bass but it did not work. When placed normally in my ears they fall out quickly. Who works out with these? Are ears shaped that differently?

Keep or Return

The form factor is great, no other product that i could find that has what i needed, a bluetooth headset with no extra dongle, 2 ear pieces and a mic.

(It gets confused with my car profile and i have to disconnect & unpair sometimes)  My ipod touch however isn't an issue.
The last small knock is uptime.  I think i'm just being greedy, i can listen to music for about 5-6 hours, that's actually great considering the battery seems to be in the earpiece.

I have worn the motorola headphones and they feel bulky. These are lightweight and I can hardly feel them. They come with three sizes of ear buds. The middle size is just right for me.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,4.0,positive,"But as can be said about many things, wait for the new one to come out.

  These aren't exactly that new to begin with so i doubt sony ill give these another swing for awhile but these fall a bit short in some categories but not intolerably so.

For starters:
- Poor batter life. 4 hours isn't enough for people who utilize these buds for music more than phone calls
- Cheap plastic backing.
- Stupid piece of paper voids waranty.
- Volume on some devices won't go as high as i like (but i doubt any of you have a palm pre)

  The back of the buds themselves right behind the silver metal part is where you charge them and theres a small plastic flap that flips open revealing the charging port. Now it's not the flap that breaks but rather one day after trying to unplug them i ended up ripping out all the insides, intact with the plastic charging piece. part of the plastic broke off  but thanks to my lazyness i didn't call sony but just jammed them back in and they work fine.

  Now on a more positive note, the sound quality is superb and almost worth their value if they were not wireless assuming you got a good price. I'm no audiophile but my ears work great and they will surprise your average consumer who never bought a +100$ pair of headphones.
  Their design is beautiful and is the most low profile pair of wireless buds out to date. The above problems are like i said, tolerable, if your the positive type. Besides not much room to complain considering these are one of maybe 3-4 other decent bluetooth in ear options.",287,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,"This is a very nice bluetooth headset but lacks a few features.

It has no volume control... and worse... I cannot control my volume from my phone (HTC HD2) so I'm stuck with the same volume all the time.

Battery life is not good, lasts you a little more than 3 hours while listing to music... that alone for me was the deal breaker, I listen to 5 hours easily.

The headphones are kinda big... which begs the question why? Many other Bluetooth headsets are capable of holding 6 to 8 hour charges on smaller form factors.

Like I said, the headphones are big, they will not fit inside your ear as you would hope so, because the outside portion of the headphones are soo big that you can never really put it inside completely.

The Cord is strong, a clip is included, the case is very nice but a little tiresome to keep using.

There are two BIG problems with this headset though.

1. Battery life and standby are pretty awful. Don'e plan to get even half a day of music and talk. Don't plan to leave it in your car and hook up in the morning. The charger is, annoyingly, proprietary (what did you expect it's a sony product) so you need to haul it around if you want to use this for more then calls.

2. The little shirt clip that keeps it from falling off your neck? Yeah if you loose that you are SOL. You will loose this headset for sure and Sony style and Sony Ericksin parts will run you around point fingers at each other but nobody will sell you a replacement.

Fortunately for me, the Sony Ericsson HBH-IS8000 headset fits the bill. I've been using these for a week and they've been great so far. I will say that I was a little initially disappointed with the quality when I tested them out of the box. I heard a ton of static and popping on a couple of different devices. However, I believe this was related to a low battery as it was shipped from the store. After I charged it for 8hrs as the documentation suggests, I haven't had a single problem with static. The earbuds are slightly more bulky than the Skull Candy wired earbuds I own, though they do not feel any heavier once they're in your ear. I've worn them inside my motorcycle helmet without problem. They were a little difficult to get into the helmet, but once they were seated, they were fine. Audio quality wasn't affected in any way. The sound quality is great for a Bluetooh device. You'll find that it's a little light on the bass response, but not so much that it's very noticeable. I didn't really purchase these for making calls, but in several tests, audio quality was pretty good on both ends of the call.

One tip: make sure you use the included clip if you expect to have the headphones hanging around your neck for any duration. Even after a couple of minutes hanging on my neck (not in my ears), the headphones started to slip off my neck.

1) it can only pair to one device at a time, and must be deleted, then re-added if you decide to pair it to an alternative device.  For example, I use it with both my blackberry and my computer, but have to ""add device"" each time I switch between the two.

2) the system for charging the device is ridiculous--the proprietary charger is yet another cord that needs to be toted around.  At least a converter from USB to the ericsson fastplug (or whatever) should be offered/provided.

Out of the box I had no problem charging and syncing the headphones with my Blackberry Bold. All seemed fine as I put them on but soon after moving around with them I discovered that the ear tips did not stay in my ears. I tried all three tips with no success. As I shoveled snow in my driveway, I spent more time and energy placing the ear tips back in my ear every few minutes than shoveling. Forget about running with these too, you can twist an ankle while fumbling with the tips falling out.

I checked online and neither Sony nor any third party vendors have any alternative tips. It's really a shame because these headphones have a lot of potential. If Sony is going to charge over a hundred dollars for these head phones, they should provide better ear tips for them. In my opinion, flanged or foam tips would be perfect.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002D0ZN8Y,3.0,neutral,"Sony just misses the mark on this headset.  It could have been a five star product if they gave this product all the features I consider standard for a wireless headset.  I used this headset with an Iphone 3GS and I wanted something I could use while working out. Taking phone calls was not important to me.

First off, the positive features.  Perfect size.  I can honestly say they are the same size as wired in-ear headphones.  Great sound. Nice loud and clear, no skipping or static.  It also comes with a nice carrying case and a collar clip so you can hang it off your neck without worrying it will slip off. Paired very easily.  Sounded fine on the few phone calls I did make.

Next up, the negatives.  You can't control the volume or skip tracks from the headset!  A device designed for listening to music wirelessly doesn't allow you to control it.  It would make more sense if the left the phone control button off and only included controls for volume and tracks.  As other reviews have mentioned these features are controlled using your phone/music player.  However, the Iphone doesn't allow you to control the volume at all.  Which is a big disappointment for iphone users.

Hopefully, the next version of this product will have built in music controls.  I would also like them to use a standard charging adapter like micro usb instead of the proprietary one that comes with this headset. With those changes, this would easily be a five star product.",257,37

Sounds quality was good when it was NOT cutting out; however, THE BIG PROBLEM is that it cut out about once per minute for about two seconds or so ... have tried other headphones with this phone and they work fine so the problem appears with this headset. When switching the iPhone back to using the phone instead of the headphones, the headphones then blare a loud audio hiss as opposed to just cutting off (JawBone did not do this).

Lack of volume control was not an issue for me as the iPhone's volume was able to control the audio level just fine.

The design is good, light weight, low profile. Small problem with the mic being close to your collar in that it would rub against your shirt causing some noise.

Also note: With the iphone, volume is set at a fixed level on these (every other bluetooth item I have works perfectly and has variable volume with these headphones) BUT, i think the volume level is just right anyway...not too loud and not too soft.

If you intend to use these with the iPhone, take note of the above issue (which really isn't a problem for me) but with all other stereo bluetooth capable devices this should work fine.

Sound is excellent considering these are wireless headphones. Quality is first rate.

Manual could be a bit better as I had to play around for a few minutes to get the iphone to see the headphones and the charging indicator lights are on one of the earphones almost unnoticeable unless you know where to look. This is not mentioned in the manual and it took me a bit to figure it out.

Once I got these setup they sounded great - it is a great thing to be wireless with high sound quality. I can leave my phone o the desk and walk around the office and still have full connection to my music, audiobooks, and phone calls.

I'm no audiophile, but sound was decent, though it seemed treble and high frequencies were lacking in detail. Obviously, at the same price, wired headphones beat this in sound quality. (My Shure's sound much better)

As an iPhone user, the lack of volume control makes this purchase a little disappointing. However, I think it should be noted that both sides (SE and Apple) are at fault. Apple should update the iPhone OS already and give us AVRCP already. It's disappointing when most of the phones in its class can control volume while the iPhone cannot (I don't think such low scores from iPhone users are justified and are being unfair). SE should have given us volume control, but how they would integrate that while keeping it slim I have no idea.

Another drawback is the proprietary charging interface. Since it's battery doesn't last that long (2 hours according to the manual), I expect I would have to carry the charger everywhere I go. It would be much easier to carry one charger for my laptop and use mini USB to charge the headphones.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. I'd recommend it to people who have AVRCP-enabled devices.

1. Price: $120+ is far too much to pay for the limited features, sound and voice quality.

2. Compatibility: The HBH-IS800 is not 100% compatible with the iPhone 3G / 3GS and OS 3.x. The iPhone's volume control does not work when playing music over the HBH-IS800 due to the incompatibility.

3. Audio: Mediocre. I noticed flutter and hiss when playing music with sharp highs, silences and pauses, such as classical pieces; too much hiss for acoustic guitar; weak bass response.

4. Microphone: Definitely not a noise reducing mic. People I was talking to had a hard time hearing me, the background noise from my end was very loud, voice echo was very pronounced. Voice-dialing did not work well due to the poor mic quality.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,3.0,neutral,"Great cheap product. Does it's job, holds the phone tightly, has a charging port for your phone or a portable amplifier, and overall a decent design.

But it will fall apart on you. I've had to open it up twice to resolder some parts. The main issue is with the cig lighter plug. Somewhere up in there, gremlins have eaten away at the solder. It's incredibly tricky getting that part of the plug fixed. Also the constant bending of the lighter plug kinked the wire that provides power. That was my first fix on this product.

If you're fancy with a soldering gun (I'm still quite the ""globber"") then you'll be able to deal with it. If you are going to throw this away if it breaks, then look elsewhere. When it works, it's great. When you mend it, it works great for longer.",144,17

We could both hear echos of ourselves which was distracting. Otherwise, for the price, this thing works great. Just a few things have gone bad since I've had it for a while: the rubber in the jack is out of shape so it wiggles a bit; and in order to plug the phone into the transmitter/charger, you have to have the side grips unlocked, or it won't go all the way in.",140,23

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,2.0,negative,"This unit works and generally provides a clear signal, however it is extremely bulky--much thicker and heavier than the phone itself. As a result, it tends to twist in the socket. The cabled dock connector allow the transmitter to be used with just about any case [I haven't tried a large Otterbox case, but it should work], however it makes connecting and disconnecting the phone a little awkward and the cheap connector came apart within a week of use. Additionally, this transmitter lacks any swivel to easily switch the phone between portrait and landscape modes, with the latter often being the better choice for GPS apps. The gooseneck only bends about 45-degrees in each direction, so if installed at just the right angle it can be bent back-and-forth between portrait and landscape, but it is not an ideal solution. Bottom line, it cheap and generally sufficient, even if marginally so.",150,68

Then I tried a tape adapter, and it crapped out after a couple months and started clicking incessantly.

The only other small draw back which I feel may be unavoidable is when its plugged in but not in use it may interfere with other radio stations.

I could see if I used the thing for years or something, but 3 weeks!!!  Probably used it only a dozen times, max.....  Seems like somebody would go through this in testing, not on the street.

The item I bought looked like the item in the first picture, and had the bendable arm.  The weight of the holder and my IPod was too much for the arm on the holder and would cause it to droop and eventually come loose from the port.  I was constantly adjusting it.  The remote would have been a nice feature if it would have worked from farther than 5 inches and not having to be pointed directly at the transmitter readout.  And you may have noticed my past tense references.  That's because after a couple months, the holder broke away from the arm.  In the trash it went.  I would have given it a 1 star, but I think it may have worked better in a car with a different dash setup.

It even fits when my iphone is in its otter box. It's tight but it fits. The hands free works good too. if the radio is to loud it may echo, just turn your radio down. I read before buying that it doesn't save any frequency besides 88.1 but I haven't had to try another because 88.1 comes in crystal clear. I'm blown away!

3. The unit amplifier is terrible.  I have a very good stereo in my car, but I can hardly hear anything with this unit.  Your car's stereo must be cranked till the max.  But then you have to deal with noise at this level.  This is very annoying.
4. The unit does not remember your pre-set FM frequency.  So, if your car's cigarette adapter power goes off with the key, you have to redo everytime.  That is super annoying.

The remote only works when you are up on it and its angled a certain way

The iPod remote was pretty much worthless unless you had it flipped upside down and the screen (which is at the top of the device.  Why?  You can't read it from there) pointed at the remote.

Of course it did what I wanted primarily.  It charged and it transmitted what I wanted.  However, it suddenly stopped working a month after I received it and I can't get it to charge without my vehicle completely stopped and nudging it slightly to make sure whatever is connected (loose contacts or a blown fuse, I don't know).  I go over a bump, it stops charging and the FM transmitter stops transmitting.  If you have an iPod or an iPhone, you know that when you unplug the headphones or unplug it from a speaker dock, it stops whatever's playing.  So I'd have to go back and start the song or podcast all over again.

The line-in cord that it comes with also broke almost a week after as well.  Which I expected after constant connecting and disconnecting.

All in all, I kinda suspected this item wasn't going to work as well as I wished.  I read customer reviews and saw the disappointment.  I still didn't listen.

May as well just press the button on the ITouch to change tracks.  I bought this one because I like the flexible arm.  I was hoping to be able to position it away from my car radio which it does, however, it doesn't stay.  The unit tends to twist in the cigarette lighter socket downward.

One feature that I really appreciate is the remote control. Even though several reviewers found it useless, I believe it is ideal for people travelling on the back seat to operate the Ipod and avoid asking other persons to help them with changing the music. Nevertheless, I'd really liked if a volume control hadbeen included, but the volume could be controlled just on the stereo itself, not the transmitter nor the Ipod.
I found people trying to sell you one of these on shopping malls for as much as US $140 and there are people paying that much for it after a good demonstration of its features: I'm not surprised because it is offering a complete plattform to integrate your Ipod/Iphone with your car stereo.",163,179

Driving in Atlanta GA is a challenge as it is, Atlanta radio stations only compound the possibility of road rage with their idiotic patter, relentless talking over the music, and the sense that whatever they have to say is vastly more entertaining than the tracks they should be playing. The trouble, granted not a large one in most towns, but potentially deadly in this one- is that one is required to divert attention from driving to inserting music.

to the radio stations in my phone apps like Radio Paradise, Public Radio and I heart Radio.
And of course it charges up the phone at the same time and if I get a call, whatever I'm listening
to is automatically muted and I just hit the speakerphone and talk 'til the call is over. It's a
great hands-free unit. It comes with a remote, as well, which is nice in the trailer. I can sit across

Overall fm quality was good and selecting the station signal was easy with a simple toggle of buttons at the top of the unit.

The big negative here is the build quality of the unit. Over time it loosened up and after only 4 months died. $4 a month isn't horrible but I'd hoped to get a year or two out of an fm transmitter for my ipod.",121,196

-Remote worked for 2 days, but you had to be really close. After that it never worked again.
-When you turn the car off, the transmitter will always go back to 88.1.

I think this is fantastic for the price, and so far so good - in my acura RL 2005, no problems at all.

It would only work with the 3.5 jacks and the sound quality wasn't as good. Also, the remote never worked unless you pointed the thing down towards the transmitter from above.

Pros
It does work. For the price that I got this for, I wasn't expecting much. It holds my ipod snug and doesn't loosen. The songs came through my stereo alright. It fully charges my Ipod and also has a spot for a usb cord to power any other devices (i.e. GPS)since it is in the lighter charger. Now on that alone I would give it a 4.5 star rating but then there are the cons.

Cons
This came with a remote control that as far as I know doesn't even function. As for the holder itself, it is a little bulky. It's plugged right were my stick shift is so I sometimes hit it when shifting, interfering with the transmission. Sometimes the songs come in different pitches. The bass will be strong but everything else will be weak, so I have to adjust the volume on both stereo and ipod.

I rated this 3 stars because it can do a lot for the price but remember it's a low price. Put the ipod on shuffle and take a drive and you should be satisfied. Hope this helps",228,214

After reading everyone's reviews I was convinced that this product would be great for what I needed. It shipped to me is 5 days which is fairly fast in my opinion. It contained everything the description said it would come with. When it came to using this device, it did not work. The remote nor the transmitter. I'm not sure if the one I received was defective and maybe I just got the bad one out the bunch, but this device simply DID NOT WORK. I plugged it up in a few of my cars and I got nothing. After ready everyone's reviews I was sold! I'm upset I didn't get to enjoy this device and discover how wonderful and satisfactory it was said to be..",154,235

I didn't realize that you couldn't charge and listen and wondered what was wrong, trial and error and I figured it out. Other than that it's super, I haven't tried the remote out yet so I can't comment on it. I thought it had broke one morning when it swiveled and flopped around but then realized it can be tightened up for the angle of the ipod. I like this one better than the other one without the holder I also bought through Amazon. It sounds great on my radio with no static and it doesn't have to be turned up full blast.
Edit - should have known as soon as I give a good review I'd have a problem, went to use it today and the cable that hook the Ipod and FM transmitter had come partially apart leaving a crappy sound quality, the cable needs to be a little longer.",179,237

I have an Iphone 3GS, and if I try to charge it with this device it takes the volume away. I don't know why, but I can't figure out a way to charge it. My friend who has an Itouch can charge and listen to music at the same time, though my iphone can't. When I charge my Iphone with my regular car charger, it sends off a high pitched frequency through the FM transmitter. So, I can't charge my phone and use the FM transmitter at the same time. Though for the money, its definitely worth it. The FM transmitter works, and thats the only real reason I needed it.",126,241
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,3.0,neutral,"I was excited to receive this product - but when I did, I could not fit my phone into the holder. I have an infant and a toddler, and work in a restaurant kitchen so I need a heavy duty case, and I'm not going to remove it from the case for the 10 minute car ride to work.  The side arms did not open wide enough, and the supports on the bottom are not long enough.  Fortunately the plug fit through the narrow hole on the bottom.  I rigged it so it will hold my phone while still in the case, and have yet to actually try it out, so I will be back to complete this review.

I'm back - I live where its hard to find a nice empty radio signal, but once i found one,(the wide range made it easy) everything worked well.  Sound quality is as good as any other transmitter I've used.

A few notes
-The display does not react well to heat (and it's hard to find a station when the display is black),
-Some phones, like an iPhone in an Otterbox, weigh down the unit, causing to sometimes rotate in the cigarette lighter.
- I use the remote, instead of continuously handling my phone, to scan to next song, even though it is necessary to point it at the display.",228,242

Did have to change radio frequency a few times when I got to areas with lots of FM stations.  The remote is pretty worthless.  Couldn't get it to work at all.  The way the Ipod sits in the dock it's easier to just reach down and make your changes directly from the Ipod itself.  Other than that it's a great product.,81,246
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,4.0,positive,"I have had a few other FM transmitters ranging back to the one I got for my brand new discman cd player back in the late 90's (this was before I got an amazing 6 cd changer for my car). I had a cheap gas station one and I had a belkin. This is the best FM transmitter I have had in the quality of sound and power of the transmitter. There is a local station here at 88.1 (the default when you turn it on) but it completely overpowers it without any kind of interference. Better sound, stronger transmitter for much less than a high end brand name transmitter? I'll take it. I drive a stick shift and the long flexible neck actually allows me to shift into 5th where I had problems with other designs.

The few issues:
When I use my 3g Ipod nano it doesnt hold it in quite tight enough. This was easily solved by putting a few thin strips of electrical tape on the rubber pads so it is now secure over bumps.

No manual, can you make your own presets? Does it stop charging when full? A few questions I'd like answered.

There should be a slot or something fro the remote on the side of the unit. I solved this problem with a square of sticky Velcro. Without it the remote can easly get misplaced / fly to the floor.",238,247

However, my iPod  Video (30 GB) still seems sits comfortably in it without falling out. I have handled this item with great care yet it still seems like it is ready to fall to pieces.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,2.0,negative,"I purchased the Neewer FM Transmitter in the beginning of February.  It started out okay, then went downhill from there.  I drive a 2006 Hyundai Tucson and the transmitter fits just fine in the power jack under my radio.  The problem is that when you have it all plugged in and your Ipod/Iphone is clamped it, the whole unit becomes very top heavy.  After only 4 months of use, it has made my power jack loose.  When I turn the car, the whole thing falls over because of how loose the jack is.  Now, I just start every trip w/ the whole device hanging down in front of the passengers seat.

Another problem you may run into is the transmitting unit itself.  You can select any FM radio station you want...the only thing is, next time you turn your car on you're going to have to set it again.  It always resets to 88.1.  Luckily for me I live outside of Philadelphia and 88.1 is fairly clear when using this thing so I don't have to worry about this...just wanted to pass this on.

The remote control is useless.  I have an 80GB Ipod and it doesn't work w/ it.  Overall, the sound quality is okay...that's the only reason it didn't get one star.  Spend the extra money on a better rated model and save yourself the headache w/ this transmitter.",231,258

I do not know however if the battery has suffered because of this device as it is not a licensed apple product. I usually have it on a dock or on this transmitter so it is hard to tell. I have heard through the grapevine that these kinds of products can adversity effect iPod batteries. I do not really worry about it.

Worse, after two uses, this device fried my car's 12V accessory outlet. Not just the fuse for the outlet, but the outlet itself is ruined. Now I have to replace the outlet and wiring harness to get my car's AC outlet working again.

1) The FM transmitter causes my iPhone 3G to lose the 3G signal constantly and drop back to Edge. If I take the phone out of the cradle and hold it in my hand it pops right back over to 3G. Makes it hard to stream Pandora.

2) When the phone inevitably drops back to Edge, I get all kinds of interference in the units FM transmission. That terrible bip-biddy-bip-bip-biddy-bip of the phone talking to the tower.

3) The connector for the cradle broke after a few months of daily use. The unit no longer works for me.

4) The FM transmitter doesn't hold the FM output frequency between power-offs. Every time I start my car I have to reset the output frequency on the unit.",151,273
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,2.0,negative,"Works great as long as you don't have to drive while using it. I have 4 different places I can plug it in at and I run into the same problem each time when pluging in my itouch.  It has a tendency of coming loose, pops out, so then you have to plug it back in while driving and find the station again and gets worse if you have to turn so I have to hold it in place when I need to turn the wheel or switch lanes.  I've also ran into the sound stopping and having to unplug the stereo jack then pluging it back in again.  The snake arm on it is unstable and falls over while you drive, so your device ends up upside down. On the plus side it was cheap and was delivered fast.

Pros:
-Delivered fast
-Cheap
-Looks pretty

The adjustable arm works very well and it charges my iphone very well. I did notice that you have to make sure the base of the transmitter is in the cigarette lighter very tightly so when you are turning corners it doesn't keep going in and out.  The signal is strong between the transmitter and my stereo. There is interference with the transmitter though, if I get a text or a call the interference is extremely loud or in some parts of my city. Overall for the price it is not bad.

The remote needs a direct line of sight with the top of the device, which makes no sense and is very poorly designed. If it does have that line of sight it does work like it is supposed to though. The plug that goes into the cigarette lighter only grounds to one of the prongs instead of both which causes problems on some outlets that have open spots on them and it should be a little tighter so it doesnt lean over on bumpy roads.

You can't go wrong for the price",43,292
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,5.0,positive,"I bought this item back in Feb '10.
This transmitter has worked great for me.
Its real easy to install and set the channel.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,2.0,negative,"I purchased this transmitter a couple of days ago and it only worked correctly the first day. Now the transmitter cuts in and out and the remote doesn't work at all. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I guess the saying is true ""You get what you pay for""!",50,294
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,3.0,neutral,"Pros:

The transmitter works well. The antenna on my car was snapped off and I still get a clear signal.  Also, The default signal was set at 88.1FM which is a french radio station in my area and the transmitter had no problem overpowering the french station.

It grips my ipod touch nicely even when it's in its case.

The flexible ""neck"" works well to locate the ipod where I want.

The cigarette lighter plug keeps the whole thing firmly located.

Cons:

The blue lights are too bright. At night they create too much glare. I ended up putting a piece of electrical tape over the light.

The readout of the station/frequency points straight up and the LCD display is only visible when looked at directly so if you want to look at it you have to lean way forward and look directly down at it.

The remote only works for me if I hold it directly above the transmitter pointing down. Half the buttons on the remote don't seem to do anything.  I'm beginning to think that the remote is a practical joke.

It would be nice to have an off switch so that you don't have to unplug the whole thing when not using it.",207,295
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,2.0,negative,This product has more bells and whistles than similar items in the same category but the radio transmitter is not very good.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,1.0,negative,"This product worked OK for about a month.  The wire connecting the iPhone to the transmitter is not well constructed and came loose from the transmitter.  As such, the product does not work at all.  Too much trouble to return it.  Waste of money.",44,297
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,4.0,positive,Great product for a great price. I do not like the remote control because I think it is easier to just use my ipod touch screen.

I would recommend this product.,67,298
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,3.0,neutral,"The unit fits well in the car charger (2004 VW Passat) and holds my iPhone securely. The goose-neck feature makes it easy to keep my iPhone in convenient view.  The sound quality with the FM transmitter is decent -- there can be intermittent buzzing or hissing when there is interference from a nearby radio station, but I am usually able to find a frequency that works decently (although the hissing gets annoying if you are trying to listen to spoken material). The supposed ""hands-free phone"" function, however, is useless.  I could barely hear the caller through the speakers and he couldn't hear me at all.  Now I just use the unit to hold my iPhone and just use the speakerphone function on the phone itself.  The main design flaw in this unit is the position of the screen that shows you the FM frequency - it is at the very top of the unit, so you can only see it if you bend the unit forward.  Also, the remote only works if you hold it pointing vertically downwards towards the screen, which makes it pretty useless.  But, overall, the unit works mostly as advertised and I am pretty happy with it.",201,299

This is the same design, which rotates in the lighter socket under the weight of the iPhone 3GS when taking a quick turn, but the FM transmitter works well enough, and it charges the iPhone without problems. The side braces hold my iPhone even in a hard clear case, but it's a squeeze. I will be extra careful with this model, but at the price less than $15 that I paid, if it breaks later I can afford to buy a new one.",115,301

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B002YB4RDY,3.0,neutral,"The unit operates flawlessly and holds the Touch without damaging it.  The music sounds no different than listening to an FM radio station.  I used one of these with my original iPod and enjoyed it tremendously. This new unit is just OK.  The remote must be very close and buttons pressed exactly for it to make the desired change.  The part that inserts into the cigarette lighter (power plug) has a rubber or plastic washer to help it stay in place.  It is not strong enough to hold the iPod upright as you travel so you should be careful depending on where the plug is located.  It would earn an additional star if the iPod stayed where you plugged it in, rather than rotating around.",125,303

I have used many FM transmitters before and none are perfect, it is difficult to find any that have CD quality sound, but I think for the price it works well.  It fits better than some others I tried as you can manipulate it to move which ever way you want.  My only complaint would be the remote, as you can only use it if you point it at the very top of the transmitter (a bit inconvenient).  Otherwise I find that it works very well, I am happy that you can choose to charge it or not, I was actually in my car with a friend and I was charging my iphone while we were listening to her ipod.",137,304

i pressed play again and the music started playing from the Itouch and not from the radio as it should!!!!
15 seconds later it starts to play through the radio again!

I'm not exactly a really active person, and most of the time that's not a problem now that I've figured out where the sound has gone.  It is important to check all the connection points before you start switching out head sets when the disconnect happens.  This is only for switching from listening to talking.  The volume control is on the phone.

Given that longevity was the issue I started with I think it's important to note that I've only had this a week or so.  I should check back if I reach the year mark.

The button on the cord is used as a Play/Pause button for the music and it works great.
The pass-through sound to my headphones is good quality as well. No degradation that I notice.

CONS:
The cord is short (just under 24"") which means you will need to keep you device close to you when using the mic. When you add the length of a typical headphone cord (6 feet), that puts the mic in somewhat of an awkward position. Either you have a wad of cord and your device in your shirt pocket, or you must talk to you belly button.

When I plugged in my headset, the case for the adapter split open at the seam like it hadn't been properly fused or glued together. A couple of drops of Superglue took care of it. For under 2 bucks, I won't complain.

I might buy a few more for the other iPods in the house and maybe experiment with splicing the microphone into a headphone cord closer to a usable position.",194,26

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,5.0,positive,"For us mobile phone users who have always wished we could use an inexpensive standard over-the-head stereo headset for hands-free application, I can't say enough good about this item.  Any 3.5mm stereo headset OR listen-only ear-bud set can be converted into a hands-free by plugging it into the female end of this adapter, thus converting the listen-only device into a good quality mobile phone headset with microphone and disconnect button. This is, of course, practicable only for telephones that have a 3.5mm hands-free jack.  It works very well with my i-Phone, and I am delighted to be able to use any inexpensive over-the-head headset with my mobile instead of the irritating ear buds which so easily dislodge from the ears during use.  The only problem I have with this adapter is that the cord length is perhaps a bit too short, placing the microphone closer to the telephone than is practical in most applications. Nevertheless, this adapter is a great innovation even in its present form, and I use it frequently with my i-Phone while driving AND in the house or while walking. At this price I bought several. This testimonial is freely provided by a satisfied customer. Comments welcome.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,3.0,neutral,"I was disappointed that the length of this thing is too short for my needs. It is about 1' 11"" almost long enough to have your phone in your pocket, and clip the mic on your shirt collar, but not quite. You might be able to hold your phone in your lap while driving with the mic clipped on you shirt collar, but you wouldn't have any extra length to set the phone beside you in the seat or anything. Other than that it seems to work fine. I bought this for my Android Incredible phone. The mic needs to be close to your mouth to pick up, but does so well and block outside noise. I just know if I'll use it much because I can't put my phone anywhere but my shirt pocket while using it.",138,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,"So far this adapter works pretty well.  I tried it with an older pair of headphones first (and by older I mean something I found in my closet from the early 90s) and I couldn't get the pause button to work.  But it works great with other headphones, so a good buy in my opinion.",55,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,"Nice little product. Mic button can pause and play the songs, pressing the button for long time opens voice control.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,"Purchased this for use with an iPhone (4) and Shure SE in-ear headphones. since most of the alternatives for a microphone extension cable are pretty expensive, I figured a ""light user"" such as myself should be ok with something more affordable (read: ""cheap"").

unfortunately, upon first use of this item the following happened:

1. Top connector (where you plug your headphones) was crackling horribly, as if contacts were loose or oxidated.
2. The third time (literally) i pressed the button to answer the call, the button recessed inside the unit and would not come out (did not answer the call...).

Wrote to the vendor within one day of the purchase, describing what happened and asked for resolution. never heard back.
I would have used ZERO stars for the rating but i guess one is the minimum... I strongly recommend that you stay away from this joke of a product; felt like throwing money to the garbage.",156,33

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,"Worked very well for about a week at most.  Then, the volume suddenly got very weak, and would no longer work.  I noticed the wire coming loose, so I tried unsnapping the case to maybe fix it, but the parts are not worth putting back together.  I used to repair electronic equipment, and so I'm used to fixing things, but I know when something is not worth wasting time with, and this is one of those items.

If you have one, be very gentle with it (I thought I was, but I mean baby the sucker).  If you don't have one, pay a little more and get something better.",109,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,1.0,negative,"This worked well the first few times I used it.  After about a week of use, one of the channels stopped working.  I had to wiggle the jack around to get it working.  This was fine since I was using it in a stationary position, however, after about a month after wiggling the jack too much, the whole thing came apart.  The device is constructed with cheap materials and is snapped poorly into place so if you're thinking of getting one of these for mobile use, you might think again.

I just ordered a Monster iSoniTalk as a replacement for this.  Let's see how that works.",106,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,Hi everyone... is the 2nd time I bought this product... is worth it... Bought 2 cause with the time and use the join of the cable and the plug connector could damage and sometimes you can't hear through the earphones.... but so depend of the use you do yourself...for that I bought 2. Beside that works awesome with my iPhone.,60,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,4.0,positive,"it works, only thing i wish is the cable can be a lot shorter.
the mute button with ipod does not always work well. IPOD most of the time mistaken it with song play command instead of mic mute.
a hassle when you are in a call and want to mute but ipod plays a song instead",57,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0034Z5GY8,2.0,negative,"This product is great...if you want a cheap piece of junk to last you for a couple weeks.

I used it and thought it was quite convenient, I liked the play/pause button and the mic worked fine.  One day I was pulling it out of my pocket and the entire faceplate fell off and exposed the innards to my eyes...it was seriously something I could have put together in a matter of seconds.  I am an amateur electrician so I put it back together and it worked fine...until the headphone jack shorted out...I attempted to fix this, but the jack was impossible to find a replacement for without making wires stick out of the casing.  So now I can only hear out of one ear when using the headphones through the mic.

Specifics:

Pros:
Low price
Nice small microphone
Works VERY well with my ipod touch

Cons:
Weak construction
Terrible product quality

I would suggest that you try paying a bit more for another product before buying this one.",169,40

I also wanted to get this so that I wouldn't have to hold the phone while driving. Turns out, this won't work with my phone... I guess if I had a smart phone instead of a dumb phone, it would work with it. Oh well, it was cheap, so it isn't that big of a deal.",96,41

It's a single cuff case, but has a wide profile, and the biggest issue by far is the attachment system. It just isn't very well made, it's a stretchy nylon as you'd expect with velcro, but it doesn't hold it solid on my 2 inch belt.

It does the job, and I think I paid 7 dollars with free 2 day shipping, so 3 stars it is.. I'd recommend the Bianchi accumold one though. I should have gotten it first.",110,14

BEST USE is probably a tactical rig, limited use. not a great everyday belt item and you cant drape a t-shirt over it if you wanted it for that purpose.",111,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,5.0,positive,"I originally bought to be a present for grandson. Tired of buying the cheap ones that break within a few days. These are heavy duty. However, Son in law that is a deputy sheriff said they are just like the training ones they use. (only those exceed $40) Upon inspection it was not advised to use for a toy and I agree after looking them over.  Here is the thing. They are just like the real training cuffs. So if you don't know how to use them and the cuffs go on too tight and you don't double lock (which kids would skip that part) the cuffs can go on too tight which can cause pain and nerve damage. There is no safety release like the Toy type. You loose the keys and your SOL. I reordered a different pair that I found to be very heavy duty for the grandson called Magic Handcuffs. I'll keep these though. Never know when I might need a good pair.",167,23

The holster is durable, it is a little ""solid"" even though it looks like it's just made of cloth-like material. To close the holster there would be a button and Velcro around the button which helps keep the holster closed. But it is kinda weird. To attach the holster to your belt, it also uses Velcro which might be inconvenient or might have some issues like it being floppy.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003DR90AS,4.0,positive,"This New Black Covered Handcuff Case is decent quality for the price. I was given a set of handcuffs so wanted an inexpensive case to hold them on my duty belt.

The case attaches securely to the belt by Velcro backing both directly to the belt and to itself, making it unlikely that this will move once it is positioned where needed. The flap has both Velcro and a snap to keep it closed.

My only issue is that this is somewhat wider than really needed so I also store a set of Latex Examination Gloves in the case along with the handcuffs to keep them from rattling around.

Not too sure how, it's not like there was too much friction nor was it abused in any way.

For the price, I guess 8 months is pretty serviceable, so if you are looking for something cheap to get to start, this would be ok, but if you want something that just goes on your duty belts and you can forget about it until you need it, this is definitely not the item you're looking for.",115,109

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"I needed a nice docking station for my iPhone 3Gs and this seemed like a good match.  I use one of Nutshell's leather belt clip cases, so I wasn't worried about any potential case issues.

The dock looks great.  Very sleek and metal (not plastic), though it does have rubber pads to keep it from damaging your desk.  I took the included cable and hooked it up (you have to pop out the cable holder on the stand, slide your cable in and then lock it in place with the holder).  They are very emphatic about you not using the Apple cable (which has the locking clips) since you want to be able to slide your iPhone or iPod Touch on and off without worrying about such clips.

At first, my phone wouldn't plug in.  Problem ended up being that the cable is labeled backwards (the connector symbol which is normally on the front of the cable connector, needs to be on the back)... I have the black unit, so I don't know if this is limited to the black cable or to any of the cables.  Anyway, that was easy to figure out and fix.

My iPhone sits in there without any issues and is able to sync data and charge.

Happy customer!

Update: 12/22/2010:  FYI... I've been using this same dock with my iPhone 4 for the past 5 months or so without any problems.",237,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"Works as advertised (hence the 3 stars) however a few things really really bug me.

1. The iPhone sticks up higher than I'd like. I'd like the connector to be recessed a little bit lower.

2. The silver isn't what it looks like in the Amazon photos. Sitting next to my alum Macbook Pro and my alum keyboard, this cradle looks more like cheap silver spray paint.  It's brighter, and more reflective. It's almost enough to return it, if it weren't for the fact that it works well.

I'd recommend getting black or another color, if you think the silver should match your other Apple products.",106,3

The cradle consists of a big hunk of metal and a separate cable you must plug in. Well its claims that it fits any iPhone even with a case on is a flat out lie. I have an iPhone 3GS with a InCase plastic shell case. The connector that holds the USB connection cable is too big and blocks the iPhone from fully seating into its spot and connecting to charge or sync.

DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A CASE ON YOUR iPod Touch or iPhone!!!",118,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"All things considered this is a very nice dock. The finish is well done and the quality of the basic construction is first rate. There are rubber inserts at the back that protect your phone from scratches. There is a rubber strip on the bottom that keeps the dock from scratching the surface it is sitting on and also keeps the dock from sliding when you mount your phone. They include two rubber (or silicone) pieces for the back of the dock that fall off when they are installed. The cable insert is clever, but sloppy. Not a tight fit to the dock and the connector does not fit my phone with the case on. The cable end itself fits but the insert it slides into is too wide. With just a couple tweeks from the manufacturer this will be a five star dock.",144,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"Now with the included cable, I think this is a really good value over the previous model. It looks good, improves the sound and does what I need it to do: gives me a bedside stand that, most importantly, works without having to remove my case.

What more can I say? It's a squiggly piece of aluminum. Alright, it comes with some removable rubber feet (I presume for non-slip and to protect the surface you put it on) and they can come off easily and be lost. Maybe they should throw in an extra pair just in case...

UPDATE: For what it's worth, as I worried would be the case, I did indeed lose the rubber feet that came with this, but after contacting the manufacturer they were kind enough to send out 2 sets of replacements.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,This item just arrived and I have to say....I love it.  I have purchased other cradles and this one is perfect for me.  My iphone fits perfectly (even with my outer case on it).  I can easily remove the phone as well.,42,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"The connector is flimsy and can't properly attach to the metal stand, so the phone is all wobbly. Tried glueing the connector in but there's nothing really for it to stick to so it fell off again. Thoughtless design, useless product.",41,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"The metal base is well made, however the good news ends there. The connection site and arrangement of the plug is cheap and flimsy and does not stand up to daily use. The base is not heavy enough so two hands needed when disconnecting. I had purchased this product to use in conjunction with the Apple iPhone bumper, a fairly standard accessory, but the plug arrangement does not allow for this. The colour is also not true to pictures - the one I received was more like a pastel metallic green. I would have returned this product, but international shipping costs made it not worth my while. It now sits, empty,  beside my computer as a reminder of internet shopping folly. Disappointed.",122,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"If you have a case for your iPhone, beware - the connector won't seat fully with ours.  Not sure what brand our case is - just make sure you understand the risk if you use a case.",37,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"It won't fit with any iphone or ipod touch with a case on it which is very useless, if i need to take off the case then why I need a stand to charge the phone, and also the connector lock is very lose I even need to put something to tight it up, and finally I cut of the side of it original top in order to put my phone in charging position!! don buy unless you don have a iphone case or slim case",86,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"This dock for the iPhone is just what the doctor ordered. Small, sturdy, stylish. Works right out of the box. Of course, I have no case for my iPhone so I have no issues with the connector not fitting perfectly, as some people have mentioned. Well worth the money, in my view.",52,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,Description states that it will work with an iphone in a protective case but it will not. Even a thin ifrogz case prevents the phone from connecting to the charge/sync cable.,31,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,crap.. pure crap. the USB cord that comes with product works for a month and then no return policy. waste of money! do not buy,25,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"I recently bought this dock mainly for my iPhone 4s. The dock is made of a nice aluminum, just like the iMac. The bought the black one. I am currently using an Otterbox Communter case with my iPhone 4s. Since this dock's connector is so close to the back end and doesn't come up too much, it is impossible to make this work for my case. Now without a case it works perfectly fine. So if you are trying to buy this dock, keep in mind alot of cases simular to the Otterbox Commuter Series case will not work with this docking station. You might want to check out the Konnet iCrado NEO, that one is a better buy in my own opinion.",123,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"The packaging was nice, but the part that holds the power cord in is just a cheap plastic clip that doesn't stay locked in place. For the money, this purchase was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! Do not buy this item and waste your money like I did! In addition, Amazon has started outsourcing shipping to cheaper companies to save money. I received this package from Prestige shipping. It was delivered by a guy and his daughter in a black unmarked Dodge Caravan at 8:00PM! I paid for next day shipping and that is what my money bought. Bye Bye Amazon!!!",99,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"The quality on this is better than I had expected.  It has a nice solid metal feel to it, and looks really sharp.  The included cable charges and syncs an iPhone 4, no problem.  It comes with rubber feet that you clip on to the back, but they don't look like they'll stay on very well if I move the dock around.  And one thing that would be nice is if the dock connector had a looser fit so that I could just lift my phone off the cradle without having to hold down the dock.",96,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"basically i thought it would work with the case that i had on it, like the description said. i was pretty bummed out when i got it and it didn't fit the function that it was meant for.",38,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,I bought a couple of these got Xmas gifts and one is broken already. Nice idea but very cheaply made. I would not suggest this for anyone that likes quality.,30,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"I've had it for..  2 years now, I think. It's been used almost daily at work, exclusively with headphones. Works very well, it's stylish and stable, uses little space, and does what it says.

I invested in a radio shack inline headphone volume control (I paid about $6) so I can have easy volume control for my headphones. The volume control should've been part of the cradle, but well, problem solved. I ding it one star for not thinking about how a user will control volume.",86,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"My husband wanted a way to charge his iPhone3 on his desk, while keeping it upright to view while working.  This  Konnet Dock does exactly that.  The sleek design and great orange color are a bonus to the functionality.

I expected this dock to be wobbly, especially side to side, but it is remarkably solid. The phone itself is a bit wobbly side to side while docked, but only noticeable if you grab it or bump it hard - just touching the screen, it stays in place just fine.

Docking the phone is not as easy as just dropping it on there, but it is easier than picking up the standard charging cable and attaching it. You just position it properly and push down.

The little white non-skid plastic pieces (that go on the back of the bottom) come right off, I don't understand why they're not tighter.  We added a small dab of rubber cement to keep them in place, that did the trick.

He has a case by Magpull, it is a hard case but quite slim.  The phone does fit on this dock while in the case.

The orange color is not traffic cone orange - it is darker than the picture online appears.  It has a deeper, richer undertone, with a metallic finish.

Overall, does what I needed it to, at a decent price.",228,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,I ordered this to have connected to my work laptop to charge my iPhone and iPod.  Works really great and I like how sturdy the stand is.  It also looks really nice.  My only problem is that sometimes the cable inside gets a little lose/crooked but it's really no big deal.,51,46
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"This cradle just doesn't work! The small plastic ""bumpers"" that are designed to provide a gentle rest for the back of iPhone constantly fall out; I've already lost two of them that have been swept away or vacuumed up. Plugging the phone in is a nightmare: as it shifts on the cradle, it starts and stops charging on its own, and often fails to charge overnight as a result. Don't even bother to contact KONNET directly; their customer service is based in Hong Kong and takes a long time to respond, and doesn't offer any resolution when they do respond. Very disappointing... I'm already looking for a replacement cradle.",109,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"UPDATED: the otterbox defender is to thick for this charger. The slope of the back starts way to early...

This is a great looking design... good for the otterbox cover and any other cover that allows direct contact to the metal around the iDevice... however the plastic clip does make me nervous about the clip just breaking through the hole in the metal.

If you have a case of cover that blocks you from seeing the metal around the iDevice charging port[...] then you will need a dock extender to leave the case on. Most cases/bumpers have a small plastic or rubber cover around the charging port that ONLY allows some charging cords to make the connection viable.

If your case allows you to see the charging port and around the charging port metal then you should love this charger, otherwise find a dock extender or grind the plastic insert down to allow the connection to be completed.

Once you plug the wire into the plastic holder it is blocked on both ends shortening the male end about 1/16 of an inch... so if you have anything blocking the top of the plastic clip from making DIRECT contact with your idevice the male end does not seed deep enough to actually charge the phone... you need a good extender for this to work.",223,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"This dock looks very nice on a desk and functions well enough.  My only complaint is that the dock connector comes loose too easily.  It is only held in place by a plastic clip that will come loose under fairly light pressure.  The entire dock connector assembly is fairly loose.  There is a rubber ring that seems to be there to stabilize the dock connector but it also comes loose easily.  Despite that, I am still happy with the product.",80,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"The dock is cool but when my iphone is plugged in it doesn't touch the backrest and just kinda floats, so if you're trying to type on it while it's in the stand the phone flaps back and forth and is annoying. Also, the silver color is very metallic looking and doesn't actually match the brushed aluminum look of mac products.",61,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"I've been using it for a while with my iPhone 3G (no case) with no complaints.  I just got a 4s and put an Incipio cover on it.  It's a pretty slim cover.  It fits, but you have to wiggle the phone a bit to get a connection.

It looks nice but is a bit pricey.",56,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"I got this to dock my wife's 3GS, and while the quality is hefty enough, and includes a cable, it does not seat in her phone in an Otterbox Defender or Commuter series. It also does not seat in my 4S with a Defender series.

Point is, it seems like a good solution if you have a small case, or none, but not a good one for the bulkier cases.",70,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,Great for night stand or at work desk.  Price is high for what it is but looks nice.  If lower price I may recommend other to buy it.,28,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"May not work on a phone in a case, but with the case bottom off, it works great.  It is a nice stable platform for the phone while it is on the charge.  It was very timely in delivery.",39,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,The charging dock looks very nice on my desk and matches my mac. Where the pug connects to the phone is a bit loose but will not fall off or hurt the phone in anyway. Over all it does the job. Good buy.,43,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,I bought this dock to use with my iPhone 4 for charging and downloading pictures.  It works very well.  The connector sticks up high enough to engage the receptacle through the OtterBox case.  It also works well just as a stand when I don't need to charge or download.  I bought the black version which also came with a black USB cable.  The fit and finish of dock and cable is excellent.  I plan on ordering a second one.,79,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"The bottom connector seems a bit too loose and when it sinks in a bit, well, the device you are plugging in does not reliable dock.
seems to worked a bit better with the iphone 3gs rather than the iphone 4, perhaps the connector specs has just changed enough...

without any side guidance (like a universal dock) having it ""drop right in"" is not quite so easy.
simple docking of course is the entire point; perhaps an example of ""nice looks"" but not so user friendly.

so, looks good, has some mechanical issues which may, or may not hit ya so buyer beware.",103,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"Works as advertised.  I am happy with the purchase.  The phone works with most covers.  If I had to ding the product then it would be over the connector at the base, where the phone connects.  The connector is a little loose and could have been made a little better.",50,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,This unit is very pleasing to the eye and u knew going into the purchase it's limitations.  If you do not have an issue removing it from a protective case then it's great.  I thought I would not have a problem doing that but it is a little frustrating.,49,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"Ok, the product works, HOWEVER...
I ordered black and it was deep green with speckles. They do not even offer this color which tells me someone mixed up the paint code... but they still sold it. HMMMM! So I painted it right myself.
Next, before I decided to paint the dock, those black grommets kept falling out. So I took them out before painting and re-glued them back into place after the paint was dried. Same with the plastic piece for holding the wire in place... need to glue that or it will push down and your iPhone/iPod will not make 100% connection.
I wrote the company but no response. I wanted to order another one but I wanted to make sure I did not have same problems... They never responded!
All-In-All the docking station works with a little hidden glue, however it was not worth the high price.",149,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,I have an IPhone4 and my wife has an IPhone3GS and we both have the Otterbox Defender case. Bought two of these chargers and shipping was fast. Upon receipt secured the cable connector to the stand with the plastic latch which isn't very sturdy. Really not sure just how durable this will be. The IPhone 4 will plug into the connector but the phone sits straight up  in the stand because the back bottom edge of the phone case makes contact with the charging stand preventing it from leaning back which means all the phone's weight is on the phone's charging connector. And the IPhone 3GS's case prevents the phone from plugging in at all. Guess this is the chance you take when shopping online- nothing like actually being able to go to a store and checking out an item before buying it to be sure it is indeed what the seller claims it to be.,156,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"The dock is very cheap and not worth $30! The iCrado Plus claims that you can plug in any iPod/iPhone with or without a case. This is not true for any case I tried. I tested with an iPhone 4G with an iSkin solo case and no luck. I also tried an iPod Touch 4G with a small case and also no luck. The dock connector attachment is too fat to fit into the hole in the case. Then if you remove the case and dock the iPhone, it does not sit back against the bumpers on the back and has all the weight balanced on the dock connector. The metal is so lightweight that it slides on the desk easily and does not feel solid when docking your device. The plastic clip that holds the cable in place is also very flimsy and cheap. The only good thing about this dock was the black USB cable that comes with it. Right now that is the only part of the dock I am using. Still searching for a decent dock for iPhone 4 with a case.",186,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"I have used this dock for a few years without problems with an iTouch.  It worked fine for the iTouch, did not have problems with the docking or undocking.  I have replaced the iTouch with a Verizon iPhone 4, and this cradle does not work with the iPhone, in or out of its case.  The problem lies in the very small lip between the end of the cable and were it goes into the iPhone.  It is only about 1/16th of an inch, but it does not allow the cable to insert flush to the iPhone.  If I take the cable out of the holder it works fine, and the cable inserts flush into the phone.  I have tinkered with it quite a bit, and I am not able to get the Verizon iPhone to charge in the holder",139,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"The unit is well made and the connection method is well thought out.  The issue I had was that the removable plastic sleeve that holds the charging cord was preventing my iPhone 4 from connecting. I removed the sleeve, filed it down a bit and all was well.  No big deal but really should have been caught during mfg'ing QA. Over all a good product.",65,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,I have looked at and tried a number of simple charging stations for iPods. This one is great because you can leave on practically any cover you may have and there is no interference to the dock. Simple and affordable.,40,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,Love the look. Was missing one of the rubber bumpers but I was able to contact the manufacturer and they sent me a full set of replacement pieces after I sent them some photos.,34,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"I am very pleased with this dock. It's stylish and works excellent with my iPhone 4. I haven't has any issues up to this point. As a matter of fact my phone seem to get better reception now; this probably has nothing to do with dock, but the fact that the phone is upright instead of laying flat on my desk.

I am NOT using the rubber guards for my iPhone 4. I am using Sonix Snap Slim Case for iPhone 4 with 2 Screen Protectors (which I am pleased with).",91,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"Got this because of the cool colors and states that it will work with ""case on"". However, although it does work with my wife's OtterBox case, it does NOT work with my Seidio Innocase. It appears that the connector is a little too fat to fit inside the case. What a bummer.",52,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,This dock has to be the best made for use with the iPod/iPhone line. No matter what slight design changes are made or what case you have it will still fit securely in the dock. Plus... it is damn sexy looking =),42,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"This ""stylish"" piece of rubbish won't fit an iPhone 3GS in an Otter case, and it's cheaply made while being over-priced. 3 strikes = 1 star, too bad I can't give it Zero stars.",34,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"this dock is awesome, it's design won't scratch any surfaces it touches. your device could be placed with a case on it. i myself have a very large case on my iphone3gs and it works awesomely.

2 problems, both very simple and just silly in general.

1. the little rubber things on the back can be removed and it is annoying to put them back on. although it is just as hard to get them off.

2.there is a little rubber ring that goes on the top side of the whole for the cable, this rubber ring is very annoying because it looks horrible after it is moved because you can't move it back to fit the way they give it to you.

#2 is vague but i gusse you'll know what i mean if you get it.",138,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,This dock worked wonderfully and looked great while it was in one piece.  After three months and one slip off of the desk what I'm left with is a piece of metal and an iPhone charging cord.,37,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"The appearance is positive. beyond that it doesn't work! when inserting the phone the connector falls off. tried using my own connector plug - same problem. the supplied rubber feet fall off whenever you move the dock.
In sum, a stylish piece of expensive metal that doesn't serve it's purpose. don't buy.",52,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"This might have worked for me but the iPod dock cable that came with it was defective. It did not work at all, with or without the dock. Additionally, the system for attaching the dock cable to the doc was defective. The cable would not stay securely attached. When attempting to put the iPod/iPhone onto the dock, it would push the cable out. I ultimately returned it and got the genuine Apple doc which works fine but require your remove any case you might have on the iPod/iPhone.",88,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,1.0,negative,"The 3 feared words ""Some Assembly Required"" if you able to get it assembled correctly it still doesn't hold the phone correctly. The best thing you can do with this is to take the cable out of the piece of metal and lay the phone on your desk.",48,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"...at least not without some modification. The cable that comes with it fits in the bumper case just fine, so if you want to be able to dock your phone without removing the bumper, you need to grind out the bracket that holds the cable, until the opening is large enough for the cable end to stick through it. Then you need to glue it in place, with the cable end sticking out about 1/16 of an inch.

Once you go to all that hassle, it's a pretty great stand. Or, if you don't use the Apple Bumper case, I suppose it'd be a great stand without any hassle.",109,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,The metal finish makes it an attractive way to sync your iPhone to a Mac or PC.,17,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"Nice dock for iphone 4.  A little disappointed that it does not work with the Apple bumper on the phone.  I bought 2 of these, one for my husband and one for me specifically so that we wouldn't have to take off the bumper to charge the phone.  The photos looked like a bumper was on the phone but it does not fit with the bumper on.",67,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,Don't waste your money on this even though it may look nice it's just not worth the 30 dollars!!!  It is not sturdy and the cable is headache to plug in every time I put my 3gs in.  I bought a small ihome instead for 40 and it works and looks better!!!!,52,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"I'd consider buying this one again.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,3.0,neutral,"The design is nice but it looks bigger in the picture than it really is.  Because of that the weight is light and it can tip over.

Bigger cases won't fit to sit properly on the charger.",69,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,2.0,negative,"i needed a dock that would hold the iphone4 in a case. this is not that dock. i have at least 6 cases from the apple bumper to the incipio featherlite and the iphone would not sync in this dock with any of the cases. also, as at least one other review pointed out, the fit where the connector seats into the bottom of the dock is sloppy and loose. it functions fine if the iphone4 is without a case, but the feel does not inspire confidence. i'm waiting for a sema leather case and if this dock doesn't work with that case i'll have to keep looking.",108,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,"I bought a new aftermarket stereo for my old '97 Civic, which has a USB port on the front so you can connect your iPod/iPhone and stream music through the car's system. Unfortunately, the car doesn't have anyplace for me to put my iPhone while I'm driving that's even remotely convenient. I was basically connecting it and letting the phone drift around the passenger seat. Obviously this situation would not fly for long, so I started looking for some way to mount a bracket or dock for the phone, and settled on this.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,5.0,positive,This product came from the seller as advertised and on time.

The dock also accepts the iPad, however, once mounted on the stand the iPad is very top heavy.  It does not feel sturdy as you use it.  Things wiggle around and it's just not sturdy enough to use day to day as an iPad stand.  I tend to worry that the dock is going to put too much stress on the usb connection.  I ran to Michaels crafts and found a mini easel for around $14 and it works perfectly.  The only downside is that the cable is not integrated.",134,91

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"As others have noted, this is hardly a heavy-duty piece of hardware.  It does tend to disassemble itself if you don't use a little care in plugging & unplugging your phone.  However, it's easy to put back together and use.  We're using it with iPhones that are inside protective cases.  One is in the rubber case that SquareTrade gives away with its warranty.  The other is in a Speck CandyShell case.  No problem making connection for charging in either case using the cable that came with the stand.  You need to press down slowly and firmly to make initial contact, and then it charges just fine.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"Does what its supposed to and holds my iPhone 4 while it syncs/charges. Only down side is that the back support doesn't actually touch the back of the iPhone 4, so it is only held up by the connector (seems stable enough).  Just a little bit of pressure on the front of the phone causes it to make contact with the back, so it does prevent the phone from bending/tipping when you try to use it in the cradle.

I received a free Apple bumper; when the bumper is on the phone, the connector does not fully mate with the phone and thus you can not charge/sync.

Some reviewers have complained about the packaging.  It is fairly intricate packaging, but it only took me a minute to get the dock out of the packaging and I have a broken thumb.  Took less time than it would if it was in a plastic blister-pack/clam-shell.",153,95

I have a generic iPhone gelly case I bought from the AT&T Cellular World store similar to the Case Mate Gelli Case and seems to plug in fine with this metal dock with case on. It plugs in perfectly to charge and sync. Still requires a 2-handed pull off, one handed insertion but it's not too loose or tight (more on the loose side). The phone just sits on the plastic dock connector which is what keeps it upright. It doesn't rest on the back metal piece probably b/c it's skinnier than the iPhone 3gs. Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they are saying it was difficult to plug in their dock connector into the dock. Mine came with the dock connector already plugged in and all I had to do was take it out of the packaging (did take a little effort, I guess to prevent stealing) and plug it into a computer. Simple, no instructions needed. Does come with plastic protectors so that the metal doesn't scratch the table. It does come off too easily but some Scotch tape can fix that. Also, the cord doesn't stay through the back notch provided if you have the tendency to pick up the dock when pulling off the iphone but also easily solvable with some tape. The cheapy part of the whole thing is where the cord meets the dock connector on the underside(very cheap plastic) but I don't see it being a problem unless you decide to remove the cord provided. Also the cord length is only 3ft long. Bought a USB 2.0 cord extension to solve that problem.",288,99

Then the ""feet"" that fasten on the Dock fall off with the slightest movement of the Dock on a desk.  Finally, an iPhone with case does not easily fit on protruding connector.  Worse, the flimsy plastic clip doesn't hold the connector, which falls out with the slightest pressure.  On top of all of this is the exorbitant price.  I read plenty of warnings about these deficiencies in various reviews, but the attractive design of the Dock short-circuited the left side of my brain.  Warning:  purchase at your peril.",155,101

The dock feels unstable and awkward. You use your own iPhone cable, which is fine... but the dock doesn't grip the connector in a very solid way.

The final blow, alas, was that the stand did not charge my iPhone while in the case: the charging plug kept popping out of the iPhone. Tried multiple cables, but it seems to be a design flaw of the stand: the plug of the cable simply did not reach far enough through the opening in the stand.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003JZAYZE,4.0,positive,"I recently purchased this item based on a previous review I read on Amazon that allows for an iPhone with a case to be synced without having to remove it from the case.  Overall, the item is very sturdy and has a heavy metallic feel (which is natural, since it's metal).  The base comes with two small rubber stoppers on the top portion which is what usually keeps a uncased iPhone in the correct angle.  In order to sync my iPhone I had to remove these stoppers.

The first times I've gone to connect my phone it's not really been the best experience.  The sync cable connects to the unit from below and locks into place with a plastic clip.  Well as it turns out the clip I had on mine wasn't holding the cable correctly, so basically it would snap the cable loose and it would fall down.  So basically I'd have to hold the cable from below while connecting the phone and then it would work fine.

However I wrote the manufacturer on their website and they promptly sent me a replacement clip (as well as the top connector) and this should do the trick.

The iCrado is no easier to connect to an iPod than the white cable that comes with the iPod.  As to the design of the unit, it is attractive but not as functional as I hoped.  I have other docks for the home portable phone and a wireless mouse that are rather simple - you just get your device close and it slides in and starts charging.  Not so with the iCrado.  I cannot do it in the light from the computer monitor, and even with the lights on you have to get right in front of it and it pretty much takes a couple tries then you have to shift it a little to make sure it is connected - the iPod is secure once it is in and it does look good.

Pros:
 Light weight and holds your iPod or iPhone fairly securely.
 Your iPhone/iPod can stay in whatever case or cover it's in while in this dock.
 Raises the iPhone up so that the speaker and microphone are deflected and slightly amplified acoustically- use with or without ear buds/headphones.
 Comes with USB connector/syncing cord.
 No special adapters needed for any model/generation of iPhone or iPod.

Cons:
 Only holds iPhone in vertical position, so watching movies, using games or apps in widescreen mode is out.
 Cheap silicone, non-skid ""foot pads"" for the rear edge keep coming off without some sort of adhesive (not included and good luck getting anything to stick to the silicone).
 Sometimes you have to press the device down fairly hard to get the best connection.

Still, given all that, I do like and would recommend this product to other iPhone/iPod users that need a inexpensive docking solution with a small footprint for their desk, table or counter that allows them to hear music and use the speaker phone while docked without headphones/ear buds.",213,115

I think it gives the right balance of cushion from a fall (more than a hardshell case) but isn't floppy or a dust magnet like a silicone case.

I have dropped my phone from chest height a number of times onto hard surfaces like concrete and my phone never cracked or scratched. It protects the screen with its raised bezel as well as all the buttons. The material it's made of (TPU I think) pliable and smooth enough to slide into and out of my pocket without being too grabby but has enough grip that I can hold it easily.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,"I've had this case since Aug 2011 and its been great.  Bought it on clearance at Walmart for less than $10 and regret not buying two since I cant find another one for that price.  My phone and this case have been through a lot over the past few months.

For example, last month I managed to drop it out a car window while doing 60mph on the interstate and nothing happened to it.  After this experience I have to question how people are able to break the front or rear glass on these phones.  I wouldn't recommend repeating what I did since it was pretty stupid and I got lucky it didn't bounce/roll off the bridge (yep on a bridge when it fell out of the car), but if that didn't break the glass or even scratch the phone in any way so how do others break their phones glass?

PROS:
Feels great
Protects phone extremely well
Protects the phone from the following:
  Falling off a table
  Dropping out of your hand
  When thrown by 2yr old
  When dropped into a cup of water (not sure if this was the case or just pure luck, but no damage and no water markers changed color??!?)
  When dropped out of car at 60mph!

CONS:
Fades due to the heat
Fading turns the case 'yellow-ish' makes it look dirty

I also wanted something that doesn't have that pocket stickiness and this does the trick while still being easy to hold. The cutouts for the charging cable and headphone jack are good and don't interfere with anything I've tried to plug in, and the silence button is accessible enough. People that complain that the button is too deep should complain to apple about the size of the button, the case needs to be thick enough to offer protection to the phone.

I was aware of the 'clear' case being more like a frosted plastic and was okay with that before purchasing. However, when I received this product it was full of cosmetic defects.

Wash it off and then its no big deal, right? No...I tried washing these mysterious fingerprints and buildup off with degreasing soap and they are still there. I have come to the conclusion that the fingerprints may have been imprinted during the molding process. Also the frosted plastic is not frosted in two areas, which I cannot explain. Overall, this seems like a defective product or previously used. Disappointed because I bought directly from Amazon, which usually means they have better quality and the product is less likely to be a rip-off.

I rated it 5 stars, so the following should be taken as nits rather than real complaints, just for full disclosure.

- the case fits so tightly that the screen protector doesn't fit flush; I'm paranoid about protecting my investment, so the screen protector went on even before I powered it up (I SAID I was paranoid!) The case overlapped the screen protector I could cut one to fit, but decided to go without: the glass front is much harder to scratch than the older plastic faces, and the case has a nice lip on the front to prevent scratches when you put the phone down on its face. I like the lip also because I HOPE it will protect that front glass at least a little when I inevitably drop the phone on a hard surface.

- the cutout for the ring/vibrateOnly switch doesn't quite line up with the switch on the 4S. Still completely operable, just not perfect.

- the cutout for the universal connector (bottom edge of the phone) works fine with modern connectors. Some older and third-party cables are thicker than the cutout and have to be forced in to get a good contact.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,"I have a white Verizon iPhone 4 so I wanted to have a case that would allow me to show off the white phone. The front glass is protected by a standard film. The case slips in and out of my pocket with ease. I sometimes put my monthly transit pass in the back of the case so as long as I have my phone with me all I have to do is show the back of it to the bus driver.

There are two aspects to a phone case. 1. It should look good. 2. It should protect the phone. I was able to verify that this case meets the second when I dropped my phone on a gravel driveway. The case protected the back and side of the phone perfectly. I hope I don't test the case again!

Update (10/31/11): I've noticed that the case is starting to get discolored. It is still transparent, but the back of my white iPhone is starting to look a little yellow when viewed through the case. I bought a couple more of these so I can just change the case every few months.",192,95

I had just gotten the iphone maybe a week and a half ago and even before i had it i always fell in love with this case on other peoples phones. Verizon tried convincing me to get this case at their store and i knew i could find it more reasonably priced online. This is my favorite color and i knew this was the case i wanted. It was everything i expected! It is just enough to make your iphone a statement without being too crazy. And everyone kept saying how the buttons were stiff with the case on, i did not notice the case making buttons hard to press at all. The time reange for when this item was to arrive was actually like 3 days earlier than the expected arrival date. This owner gets items out asap after the order was placed. This is an exceptional experience with this store owner. If i ever need to order something i will definitely buy from this seller again! Overall, i give this item and store owner an A+",184,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,"I ordered this case so that it would arrive in the mail at the same time as my iphone 4 arrived.  The shipping was great and on time, but the case itself is unusable.  I did not mind that it was frosted (once it's on the phone it does not look as tinted as it does right out of the package) and the volume and silent buttons were easily accessible.

Here is the problem (at least with the one sent to me):

THE CASE CONTINUOUSLY HOLDS PRESSURE ON THE POWER BUTTON THUS CAUSING THE IPHONE 4 TO CONSTANTLY GO IN AND OUT OF SLEEP MODE AS WELL AS BRING UP THE ""POWER DOWN"" SCREEN.

Obviously this makes the phone inside this case unusable and I returned the product.  I tried a few different ways to resolve the physical problem with the case (stretching the top a bit, moving the phones around), but nothing would work and I could not lock my phone with the case on.  It was also very annoying to keep cancelling from the power down screen.

I would not recommend this case.",185,97

However, the clear case has totally discolored over time. It is now a yellowish brown and quite unattractive so thats a bit of a bummer. Now I am looking for a new case.  The case does what its supposed to do, protecting the phone from drops and scratches but I am disappointed and hesitant to buy another Belkin case.",117,103

On top of that, there are a number of smudges and lines on the case. It looks like the case has been used before. And the lines don't look like they will come off. I would expect a site like Amazon to sell good products. And don't get me wrong, most of the time it does! It's a great site.. Just this time I'm a little disappointed.",134,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,"Unlike some people who bought this, so far it doesn't mess up my screen protector.  That might have to do with the size of the protector.

The real pain was the top button.  This case keeps the button mashed down all the time on my AT&T iPhone 4.  I took a small piece of clear plastic, the kind that manuals and stuff ofter comes in, which is very thin, and cut it out and folded it to fit between the top button and the headphone jack.  Almost invisible and stops the button from being press down.

Wasn't worth returning it and I needed a new case.  Shame I had to hack it to make it work properly.  Otherwise it's totally worth what I've paid for it.

Update:  After a few days the sides are starting to open up on the front.  Wound up taking it off and buying a different case locally that I could put on and see if it would work.  I've decided that it's best to not purchase phone cases online.  Too many poorly fitting cases of inferior quality.",182,105

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,"So initially I was discouraged to buy this product from what some of the reviews said. Others had said that the case was not completely clear but when the phone is actually in the case it looks completely clear. What they were referring to was that when the case is off, the back part of the case looks a bit cloudy but you can't notice that on the phone like I said. Other than that, I thought the case was pretty good. One minor issue is that the cut-out for the silent switch on the side of the phone, doesn't line up perfectly with the switch. I actually had to cut out a small piece so that the case would be more flush against the phone and so that I could access the switch much easier. Overall, it looks good.",140,110

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,1.0,negative,I was so bummed when I got this and it didn't align with the buttons on my iPhone 4.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,"This is a simple design that shows off the Apple iPhone 4 design and yet still protects it. The rubber buttons on the side are robust, but do become easier to press after a few days of using them. Really this is just what I wanted, apart from one small problem. When the case is in position and all the button protectors are covering their corresponding buttons and the cut-aways for the camera, the ear phone jack and the charging adaptor are also in position, the cut-away for the 'quick silent' mode switch is slightly out of line and makes it difficult to use. It isn't the biggest obstacle to overcome admittedly, but does seem like a pointless oversight.
An otherwise perfect iphone 4 protector.

I like it very much, and other members of my family have since purchased these cases as well. I've had it for almost nine months, have dropped the phone a couple times, and had no issues. Pictures I've taken are clear and have no glare on them. What I like best about it is that it allows you to see the beauty and form of the iPhone, since it's clear, without hiding it in rubber or colored plastic. Of course if you are really hard on your phone, maybe you need more padding, but this case will help the phone survive a couple drops with a minimum of scratches.",130,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,"I have tried many iphone cases and I keep going back to this one. not only does it protect your phone it is very low profile.  The case does not attract lint at all and slips into pockets with ease, yet is flexible. I hate hard cases, they always come apart when you drop the phone.  When i have dropped it it protects my phone perfectly as it bounces off the ground.  yes the volume and sleep button are covered but they do not interfere with the operation at all as they are not stiff.  Unlike a lot of cases out there, this one isn't going to scratch your phone.  One review said they thought it was purple tinted yet they found it to be more purple? No idea what that means.  The case is a see-through purple, meaning that you can see the apple logo on the back of the phone but it is clearly purple.  I tried it on a friend's white iphone and I did not like the look of it, but then again I don't like the white iphone, she however loved how it looked. For ME it is the perfect shade of purple, not too dark, not too light. belkin did make an error in making this case. it doesn't matter if it's at&t or verizon, black or white, at the top of the phone in the middle it does not sit perfectly flush but is only noticeable if you are looking for it.",249,120
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,4.0,positive,"This case works great.  I bought it for my white iPhone 4.  It is easy to grip and doesn't slip out of my hands.  The bumper protects the screen in case you do drop it, which I have.  The phone was perfectly protected.  The only problem is that this model might have been made for the AT&T version and I have the Verizon model.  The button coverings are not perfectly aligned because of this.  Notably the mute switch on the left side of the phone, where the cut out is slightly off.  I don't see this as a big issue.  I can still slide it where I need to.  But this was the only reason I didn't give it five stars.  I want to also point out that the case isn't completely 'clear'.  It's slightly frosted.  This also doesn't bother me but it should be noted in case that is what you're looking for.",154,121

Yes, it stays on, but it doesn't wrap the edges too snugly--they pull away.  The case is flexible--I had trouble with the front edges pulling away at some points, yet it would peel my screen protector off at some corners.  Ringer slide button recess didn't line up too well and the phone's volume buttons actually pushed the case away from the phone (which didn't get much better when I literally used an X-Acto blade to make recesses over the volume buttons).  Material also gets caught up in pants pockets--hard to pull out without pulling entire pocket lining out!  Maybe wearing silk-lined pants is a way around this.  Just a horrible case in my experience.  Isn't there just a simple clear, HARD plastic case out there for the iPhone 4?",148,123

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,2.0,negative,"I purchased this case because I wanted a clear, rubber case to protect and showcase my brand new, white iPhone 4.  Now that I've received it, I am disappointed in it for a couple of reasons.  First and foremost, the fit is bad.  The opening for the silence button on the left side of the phone is positioned too high making it difficult to use the switch.  It also bows out at the top, bottom, and sides which detracts from the straight, streamlined look of the new iPhone 4.  This also causes an annoying ""click"" whenever I grip my phone as the top lip of the case slides back over the edges of the phone.  Secondly, the picture of the case that is displayed for this item makes the back look completely clear, but it is frosted.  It makes my phone look dull, and you can hardly see the silver apple through it.  I am keeping it to use when I exercise while carrying my phone because it is very sturdy and will offer great protection if I drop it, but for everyday use I will order something different for both looks and convenience.

I've had a few cases before this one and this one rates at the top. I had a two piece case to start with which came with the phone from AT&T and I liked it until I dropped my phone and broke the case. The case did do its job though and the phone wasn't hurt so I couldn't complain at all and it was free. The next case I purchased was a rubber glove case that fit excellent and I liked it real well until I put it into my pocket and when I went to use the phone the case was covered with fuzz, etc. This case doesn't collect lint and it bulks up the phone just enough to make it fit my hands well.

Case fits great for ATT iphone 4, volume buttons line up and are easy to use, power button is also covered and works fine, silence switch is not covered, is a little harder to access, but not a big deal. headphone jack opening is right for the iphone headphone, but might not work for other headphones that have larger plugs. Sync connection is exposed properly, no problems with the different sync cables I use.  Camera and flash are also exposed, but I did notice a little reflection with the led flash sometimes, not all the time.  Might depend on the distance of the object you take a picture of.  Front of the iphone has some protection with the ridge of the case, so you safely put the iphone down face first.

I have no problems getting my phone in and out of the front pocket of my jeans (although it would obviously be even easier without a case), and I really like the fact that the case juts out above the display just enough so that if you lay the phone on the table face-down the display doesn't touch. Whenever I hold my iPhone without the case I feel like I need to hold it with two hands cause it might slip and fall, the Belkin case on the other hand has a nice grippy feel to it which is reassuring. It also just feels better-made than similar cheap cases (my uncle and brother each have the iPhone 4 with a similar but much cheaper clear no-name case, and you can really tell the difference).

It isn't incredibly stylish - just a plain, clear, plastic (but sorta rubbery) case that does it job.

As I have yet to drop my iPhone 4 I can't say anything about the actual level of protection it offers, but it seems sturdy enough.

I agree with other reviewers that the volume buttons are stiff, but mine are getting better over time.

About the look: I like the purple - helps me to distinguish my phone from my husband's when both are on the counter, but it isn't too colorful or tacky for my business lifesteyle and 40-something tastes.  And it does let the Apple logo show through, if that matters to you.  If you are someone who likes to make a statement with your phone case, this probably isn't the one for you.

The camera flash wouldn't work in the case due to glare. After a couple weeks, the case already looked yellow. I returned this case when I found out that a smoked version was being released. We are very happy with the smoked and purple versions.

Beside those issues, the case works great. The rubber isn't too soft as to get caught up in your pocket, but stays put on slippery surfaces, like a table or dashboard.

I am very pleased with the look and feel of the material and the fact that it doesn't bulk up my iPhone.

The only thing that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that with the case on I can not put the phone in its dock, or attach it to my Bose Sound Dock (Father's Day Present from wife and kids). I don't blame Belkin as much as I blame the dock manufacturers. Because the Vue Grip fits so tight it makes it a little difficult to take off every time I want to listen to music through the Sound Dock. Like I said, though, other than that I LOVE IT.",178,159

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003R6KW02,5.0,positive,"I haven't had any issue with what others are saying about the buttons being hard to press. This case is very slim and protective. I'm not usually a fan of silicone cases (in fact, I thought this one was hard plastic when I bought it), but this case doesn't have the ""sticky"" feel that most silicone cases have. Sometimes, that makes it hard to slide in and out of my pockets, but not with this one. Another problem with other silicone cases is that the sides seem easy to peel away from the phone real easily. This case has a stiffer, tight fit so that this doesn't happen.

The front of the case also has a bit of a lip to it so that when you set it face-down, the screen isn't touching the table.

In summary, this is a very low-profile and protective case that adds a little bit of style to the phone.

I haven't had any trouble plugging in any of my accessories designed for my old 3GS or other iPods, either.

I ordered direct from Amzer because Amazon's shipping projection at the time was between 1 and 3 months and I didn't want to wait.  Coming out of its packaging the case feels nice enough, but as another reviewer stated, and I can now confirm, the case fits too loosely.  I was expecting to have to pull or tug one or more corners of the case to fit my phone in, but the phone just drops right in with no effort needed.  This is not a good thing, and it doesn't inspire confidence that the case is securely holding the phone.  So, what did Amzer get right?  The cutouts for the camera, speaker, micro USB, and a couple of others are perfectly aligned.  I have no problem sliding the micro USB cover through the cutout.  I like the added thickness of the material around the corners and back too.  It's a rugged, almost armored look, that's a stark contrast to the sleekness of the device sans case.  Preferences on the aesthetic will widely differ, but I like the look.  Let's see...  what else?  They could have raised the material on the power switch and volume rocker a little more to provide the user with better tactile clues about their positions.

With the Amzer. stick your phone in a pocket, the case falls off. Put it just about anywhere it is in contact with any but smooth, smooth surfaces and it just falls off.

I asked for either a Refund (where they paid for return shipping if they wanted it returned) or an exchange for a case which fit correctly.  They never replied to my second message.  The case itself feels great.  If it fit correctly, I think I would really like it.

Since they have not replied, I decided to post this video as an Amazon review.  In addition, I contacted my Credit Card company and had the charge removed.

If Amzer does not respond or refuses a refund or exchange), please call your credit card companies and have the charges removed.  CONTACT AMZER FIRST though and make sure you have documentation regarding your attempted contact with Amzer.

Pros:

Feels soft
Looks good

Cons:
Too loose
Comes off when removing from pocket",32,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B003V8AM8S,3.0,neutral,"+Looks very nice.
+Corner and rear thickness is a good design. The sides are thin, but wouldn't make contact anyway from a simple fall, the thick parts would take the damage.
+Easy to take on and off by pressing the insides of the shoulder. Since a drop wouldn't press on this area, it is very unlikely that the case will fall off. If anything, a drop would push the case back on.

-Strangely does not cover the chrome rim on the top and bottom. This gives the illusion that it isn't on all the way and that it will fall off. It won't, but it's still unsettling.
-Everywhere except the corners are flimsy and move a lot, making it feel much less snug.
-Nothing lifting the speaker off of a surface. Without a case, the speaker grate is bent slightly to allow sound out. This case lays flat, however. Unless laid on its face, sound is practically muted.

Overall: It is one of the few cases for the Vibrant out there, and it is very pretty. However, it was manufactured to fit based on the dimensions of the phone, so there are no extra/custom design features that make this case unique to this phone. As a result, it doesn't provide the necessary quality expected, such as enveloping the chrome rim and allowing noise to escape when laid face up. I gave this case 3 stars though because for it's price it does provide adequate protection for people who don't treat their phones like garbage, but also for people who don't want to baby their phones.",265,34

There are a number of solutions for the problem which include replacing the headphone jack (self repair or shop repair), or get an audio solution that utilizes one of the ipod's features: bluetooth wireless headphones or speakers (which can be expensive, but nice), or find an audio line-out that plugs into the connection pins at the bottom of the device. I have a Sonoma audio device that works just fine for this purpose; it seems a little bulky, sometimes.

The adapter I am reviewing here is much smaller and less obtrusive, but it has a couple of caveats: first, when plugged into the ipod, the volume cannot be adjusted with the ipod's volume controls. You need to have a volume control on your headphones or on the device you are connecting to, or use an app that features volume control. Also, it appears that it does not function as a mic-in (at least not with the mini-mic I tried).

Let me tell you, the sound is so much an upgrade and its really easy to use. Just plug the micro usb adapter into your ipod, plug in the headphone jack into the adapter and it even includes a usb input slot to keep your ipod charged while hooked up to your receiver! How cool is that? The adapter itself is shiny black, maybe about half inch long and wide and simply works. I originally was skeptical because of the low price and there is another one here that is priced much more and basically the same thing. Now, the volume is controlled strictly by my receiver and has nothing to do with the ipod.

Once you've connected it once though you can just remember that the micro usb port on the back is oriented upside down from what you'd expect.

It was missing that little symbol that you find on apple connectors that lets you know the upside. Also it wasn't as tight fitting as I'd like, but connectors rarely are I guess. It did perform as advertised. I was able to use the line out to use my headphones as the audio jack on my iPod is toast for some reason. I didn't like that I lost all control over the volume, but I was expecting that from other reviews so I went with the flow. Strangely, the app I tried to use to boost the volume said there was no volume information. I'll try another app.

Only way to fix that permanently is to replace the audio jack which is a pain in the ass due to the way the iPod is put together. Really retarded to use glue instead of screws to hold the screen on. I guess apple doesn't want you messing with their hardware yourself. I'm waiting for my battery to completely fail and I'll do just that at the same time.

Although the product works and the idea is very good, these are the problems I have found:

- The volume of the ipod doesn't control the headphone volume at all if you use this connection, so there's only one setting of maximum volume by default that you cannot change.
- The connector itself is all the time coming out the ipod so the music stops suddenly. This is specially annoying when you connect the ipod to the aux in the car or to run with the ipod in your pocket, since every bump or minimum move makes the connector lose its sound from the ipod. Something as simple as two little buttons on the sides to release the connector (like some apple chargers have) would have fix this. Looks like there's nobody working for the QA Dept of this company...
- The piece came out chipped on the side, so not very happy with that either.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,"I just got the package today, which is a day earlier than what amazon notified me, which is a plus. The screen protector isn't all that bad, if you clean the screen carefully before you put the protector on. When putting on the protector, you should be careful but quick because if the side of the protector that contacts with itouch screen catches dust or anything, it is almost impossible to remove it, which means you need to use a second screen protector. Watch out for air pockets when you putting the protector.'If you do mess up for the first time like me, it is not a problem. The package comes with 3 protectors). I suggest buyers lay the protector starting on the home button side because it is easier that way to put it right in the middle of the touch. Keep in mind that the protector will leave a gap that is about a hair thick, but that shouldn't be a problem because you have a case. Talking about the case, the black one, to be honest, sucks like help. It has a weird trashy smell, is kinda slippery, and has a huge hole on the bottom for ear phone and etc. that is so insecure. It can't really hold the touch in place. However, the white one is a lot better. It fits pretty well, has a smaller bottom, and doesn't slip off my hand like the black one does.

Overall, I don't think this is a bad purchase and don't regret buying it. I got what I wanted, and I hope this review helps.",268,0

My white silicone case came without any imperfections but seem to become sticky and does not feel right in the hand. Both cases provide lay-on-the tablet protection. But beware, since it's very little and made out of silicone material.

The screen protector works very well and provides a matte design and only attracts little fingerprints. The micro cloth gets the job done. It's not the worst but still again, not the best. Overall, I recommend this Twin Case Kit to everyone. The price is right and the cases are worth it.",187,21

At first, I only put on the screen protector, so my son could choose which of the two cases to use.  It seemed fine, with the usual challenge of not having dust get on the film while trying to install - still ended up with about 4 pieces, each then causing an impossible to remove air-pocket in the screen, but not bad - better than his screen looked before I cleaned it to install the shield.

But, then he put on his case of choice.  Turns out the case has a lip that comes around the front that is just big enough to continually grab the edge of the screen protector and lift it up.  For several days, I kept grabbing the iPod and tucking that screen protector back under the case lip, but eventually, there was so much dust and pet hair stuck on the screen protector that it is mostly detached.  Another few days and he'll probably take it off since it such a hinderance.

Bottom line, probably better to pay a bit more for ones that work better.  The $10 screen protector I bought for my iPod 2 years ago is still well attached.  Maybe if this one were trimmed down so the case didn't flick it up, it would last better.",226,78

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,1.0,negative,Cheap in every way.  I wrote a long review last week but Amazon was down so it didn't go out.  I want to write something because I depend on the reviews when purchasing items online.  I just got my new cover and protector to replace the cheap ones I got and am so happy (mivizu product). The cheap ones I ordered from whatever company in hong kong was unusable.  I thought I could deal with cheap product but the way they made it made it unusable.  Spend $4 bucks more get a great product and get it 2 weeks faster.,100,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,This item was cheap and came in quickly. The actual product feels nice in the hands. It keeps the ipod feeling as slim as possible. It does have a problem with pulling up the corners of my screen protector though. I quickly fixed this with placeing a ZAGG full body on then using this product. I like that it comes with 2 cases. Basicly great for the price.,68,86

The paper from the little tabs that came on it telling you how to put it on left a good amount of themselves on the actual product when I tried to take them off.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,"In my personal opinion of this product, i'd give it a 3 or 4 out of 10. the screen protector was the only thing that prevented me from giving this thing a failing rating. and even that wasn't so great. i was thinking that one of the cases was gonna be a hard cover, not soft. and that there were gonna be more than just 1 screen protector. all in all, this is a lousy buy.",76,91

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,"I've only had my iPod Touch for about 2 months now, and got the black silicone protector for it, figuring it'd be all I'd need. I usually have my iPod in my back pocket, so it's safe most of the time, and isn't in much danger of falling or anything. This case did a pretty good job at first- it's comfortable, fits around the iPod perfectly, and you can access the volume and power buttons easily. The hole on the back for the camera's also the right size. That's all that really matters, right?

Cut to a few weeks ago when I noticed a couple of small tears in the casing. I never pulled at the case when taking it off, at least not in the areas the rips showed up in, and the sides of the case are suddenly loose and the iPod pops out of it every other time I take it out of my pocket. This thing's also a magnet for dust, and gets dirty easily.

For the price, it does a good job for short-term protection, but I'd only get this if you need a quick replacement case and somehow can't get a better one right then and there.

The screen protector also isn't as good as some of the others, and can be a pain to get on without any air bubbles, but when you finally get it on, it does a very good job of keeping scratches from ruining the screen. It just starts to peel at the corners a little bit over time, but with a proper case over it, this isn't a big deal.",272,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,The covers are pretty nice. I like the color choices. But it seems like the black one fits better than the white one.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,3.0,neutral,"The silicone protective armour cases are okay. Not good for everyday protection considering how it can roll down off the sides easily.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,2.0,negative,"I thought this was a great deal when I bought it. I didn't know what I was looking for because I just bought my first iPod touch. When I put the skin and the cover screen on the iPod touch, I was not impressed. The cover screen is awful. Air bubbles show up no matter how careful you are about putting it on. In addition, the protective skin is flimsy. If I dropped my iPod, I doubt it would do very much to protect it. Look for something else. Trust me.",91,104

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0041NO012,4.0,positive,this a great product and is worth your money. The screen protector sticks perfectly with the wholes of by like a millimeter.

This is a really good product at a great affordable price. I encourage you to buy this product.,76,107

I like the size, it fits into my pocket very nicely. It's a great little phone! The only thing I will complain about is the sound quality. I think its a a little tinny.. I think it could be louder when on speaker phone. But I can live with it.. If anything else I would like to see the battery last longer. So to give you a example, if I surf the web and use 1 mg a day and leave the unit on all day with texting about 10 times and making 5 calls a day the battery will last 1 day.

I have to charge it both overnight and at work every single day. And I barely use it during a day. I expected the phone to last a bit longer, but I guess it won't.",122,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,"I have had my Behold for almost 2 years now.  I bought two of them.  Think I paid $89 at the time.  It is a great phone and since I work overseas a lot, being unlocked was a necessity.  It came and right out of the box it was up and running.

I like the camera and get great photos.  However, if there is anything I do not like about the phone it is the handling of photo files.  It has been difficult for me to transfer from Behold to my computer.  It works some times and other times, no.  Even had computer geeks at work try to download with no success.

I even downloaded Samsung PC Studio or whatever it is and that did not help.

But overall, I love the phone.  I would buy another, like I said, great value.",142,32

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,1.0,negative,"It looked all fine and dandy online. The week of anticipation build up during shipping made expectations high as well. Even upon arrival, the slick little body seemed nearly perfect considering it was just a Samsung and not a Smartphone.
BUT -- disappointment rushed in when I began playing with the features.
1. The touch screen? FAIL. It was lacking to say the least. The screen is very insensitive and requires multiple taps on the same key to even text.
2. For the life of me I couldn't figure out how to turn off the vibration touch recognition without turning off sounds to the entire phone. When the ringer volume is on, the screen makes a (very) annoying beep each time it's touched. When it's on vibration mode, it vibrates. The only way I could find to get it off is to turn off all phone sounds. Maybe there is some secret way, but by this time I wasn't particularly interested in trying to find out.
3. My SIM card didn't even work in it! It said it was compatible with T-Mobile, but apparently that means every T-Mobile customer sans me. The SIM card slot is very weird -- I felt like I was sliding my card into a forbidden crevice and had some struggle even getting it back out again.

I put the device back in it's little bubble wrap bag and boxed it up, leaving it for UPS store to deal with. Kudos to the seller for processing a quick and easy refund though.",256,36

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,4.0,positive,"Bought this phone used. It came fully packaged like it was straight from the manufacturer - with battery, phone charger, usb connection, etc. The phone's appearance was flawless. Phone itself sometimes freezes and can be a little glitchy at times, but overall it serves it's purpose and works fine most of the time. It helps to power off the phone at the end of the day. My biggest complaint is that when I connected the phone to the computer, the samsung software had a problem with the phone being unregistered. I don't know if that is a general error or a user error, but otherwise the phone still charges while connected to the computer. The battery life is decent. Also, the camera works great and comes with a flash. I would not recommend this phone to someone with large hands or fingers. Overall, phone is a good value if you're looking for a touch-screen, non-smart phone, without having to renew your contract with your provider.",165,39

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,1.0,negative,"Frankly I was really loking forward to this purchase since this is my first time buying a mobile phone online. Unfortunately this buying experience turns out to be disaster. In the following paragraphs I will expalin why you need to think more carefully before making your decision to buy this cell phone.

First of all, although the website lists the product condition as ""new"". In reality, it's NOT. It is evident when I opened the mailing bag, the package is dented and has ssigns of being forcefully opened before. And small plastic bags containing important parts such as ear phone, charger all have big scratches. If these hints do not suggest the product is used, I don't what will do.

Also, the biggest concern of all (I can ignore all the minor problems such as slow shipping), is when I followed all the appropriate steps on the manual to set up the phone and charge it for 4-5 hours (exactly as the manual says), the phone just won't turn on. I even charged it for 10 hours, the screen still won't activaate. Until then I realize the phone itself has serious defeacts that can't be ignored.

Before your purchase, please think carefully first about this phone's risks",207,41

The Behold has the vertual keyboard which is large enough for her to see without her glasses and also the touch screen is friendlier to her than the one on the Gravity-T. Although they are both probably the same technology, the Behold seems to be more user friendly even though it is an older phone model.

Not the latest but easy to use and very good phone quality.  My wife loves smartphones and wastes lots of time on the web, playing games, etc and she has a Samsung Galaxy S.

It was a different shape and the connector was on the end, rather than the side as it should have been.  I contacted amazon and they first said for me to contact Samsung for a battery.  I said no way!  The description was that it included a battery for this phone and I didn't want to spend more money.

This phone is the answer. She's very happy with the phone and uses it just about everyday for the simple things and it looks very nice.

Pros:

- Internet was surprisingly fast on the phone and the video quality was rather amazing
- GPS - the turn by turn direction is a little slow but still performs adequately
- Very clear phone calls without any static or interference
- The phone looks very clean and nice

Cons:

- Despite how it looks in the pic, it was surprisingly small which makes whatever is on the screen rather hard to press if you have big fingers
- The touchscreen is really hard to press, sometimes it doesn't register if you just gently touch it like the newer models
- the call, end call, and back button at the bottom of the phone is really hard to press because the buttons are so small..

This phone is very small and compact and will perform exceedingly well for simple tasks. I would suggest a bigger phone if you're a guy because no matter how hard you try everything's so small and hard to press. Recommended for a woman or child",219,84

All of the functions, software, camera still are in great working condition. Samsung makes durable products that are meant to last.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,"I had it for two years now. It's not the best phone out there. There is no wifi. Its a pretty simple phone. The battery life is not bad, last about 3 days. Camera is okay, but the flash is crazy. It flashes 2 or 3 times and it blinds my eyes. You can click on the touch screen with a pencil if u would like. It doesn't require heat to control the buttons. The Gps does not work. I think it requires internet. But overall it's a pretty simple phone. I like more high tech phones, this phone used to be high tech 2 years ago.....",107,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0043X7JRW,3.0,neutral,"- No software for Windows 7 to perform PC sync (only XP/Vista).  It is a pain.
- Same as above. You need to use Samsung's own software for sync versus USB direct access
- Non common connector type. The phone does not use mini-USB.
- Same as above for audio jack.  The same port is used for USB, Audio, and Charger - that means you have to purchase a special ear piece if you are not using blue tooth
- Camera shot takes a bit too long and performs bad under dim light condition.  Day light is good.

Otherwise a good entry level phone to have.  Light and feel high quality in construction.",113,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,"I thought it was too good to be true when I purchased this case. It's really cute, the color is spot on like the picture. BUT, the problem is that the case DOES NOT CLOSE! I tried starting with different corners, but no matter what, the last one left will never shut. Plus, I've had the case for less than a week and I am REALLY good with my phone (I don't drop it, put it on rough surfaces, etc) and yet the bottom corners are peeling already. I'm kind of disappointed, but I guess for not paying too much, this is what I should have expected.",107,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,I loved this cover when I purchased it and I love the deal I got on it however there is a corner that will not snap shut no matter what and the design is chipping off of the plastic. It's upsetting.,41,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,"I ordered this case along with a few others. This was one of the first to arrive so of cource I put it on. Well I can't get the darn thing off. I guess that could be good in way being that your phone is secure inside the case. I do like change and like to change my cases out. I like different colors and styles but I think my phone is stuck. I tried prying it off but I'm afraid of damaging my phone. The case all around is ok looking. It looks a little cheap, where it meets together to snap closed it is missing some paint and looks a little scratched the paint is also peeling a way a bit at one of the cut outs in the back. There are also a few other little nicks and scrtaches on other areas of the case it has a few minor cosmetic issues,but for the price I can't really complain (only wish I could get it off). Delivery was quick and price was great so I'd say if your a one case kind of person this would be great for you. Phone feels secure and looks pretty good too.",201,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"I absolutely LOVE this case.  It fits perfectly.  I love the rubberized feel, which is soft to the touch but still hard enough to protect my phone if I drop it. AND, it looks great! I'm stoked! ;)",38,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,The printed pattern on the back is completely chipping off. Parts stick to my wife's hands. Definitely do not buy this product. It was a cheap price and not worth the effort to return it.,35,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"It looks just like it does in the picture. All snaps stay down , and it was a price that I can't argue with. Love Love Love!",27,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,The case was very pretty and I received it very fast. The only problem was that I dropped my phone once after puuting it on and the corner clip broke on it. Needless to say I was only able to use the case about 2 more weeks and it was broken so bad it wouldn't stay on anymore. I would def buy from the seller again tho,67,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,"I liked the phone case for the most part it was cute and girly. But, the leopard print actually started to peel off after about a week.",27,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"I was suprised at how fast I received this smoking hot pink rubberized  snap on pink/black leopard case that is so awesome
I have a new phone now so its sucks that I cant use it now.",37,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"fast shipping and it looks very cute and fun and of course easy to find. the paint is starting to disappear a little bit but it is bound to happen right? Anyways, it doesn't bother me. I am loving this case.",41,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,"This product is inexpensive so I didn't mind as much the bad quality, but overall it is pretty bad. It's a matte finish not a glossy one like the picture and the print starts to peel off after the first couple uses. I got it for the sake of having something different to look at, but I've ended up going back to my old cases.",65,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,"The case looked wonderful at first, but that didn't last long. The print peels off without hardly any distress to the phone or case. After having this awesome print cover for a week you'll be left with just a silver cover that looks like crap. Definitely doesn't last long.... Probably wouldn't purchase this again as it is not worth the time and money.",63,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,I love this phone case. It came fast and worked great. I dropped my phone a couple times and it still works,22,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,The design lasts maybe a week before it starts to scratch off. It's really not worth the money for a cheap case.,22,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,"Love this case... Super affordable, great fit. The only complaint I have is that the coating chips a bit. Nothing major though.... Not bad for what I paid for it.",30,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,Sorry I wasted my money and time purchasing this item. It is cheap plastic and will crack in no time at all.,22,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"I love this phone case.  It is adorable, easy to wipe clean, and so far, it seems to be very durable.",21,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,"This is pretty and has a soft velvety feel but the plastic is thick, making it hard to reach buttons and I had to enlarge the opening for the charging port. The plastic edges are white and really show up.",40,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,Love the color and design is durable but alignment of the charging port doesn't allow for cord to plug in tight. Cord falls out too easy.,26,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,"This product would not close completely over my phone. No matter how I tried, one corner would always not snap shut. It was still secure, but the edge would catch on things. Functional....ish. would not recommend this product!",38,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,I received compliments on the colors of this product.  At first had difficulty keeping it on phone but some muscle kept it in place. Started chipping after two weeks.,29,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,This case feels great but doesn't last long. I have had mine for about a month and the color has worn off the case where my hands most frequently touch my phone. Very disappointed. Not worth the hassle of buying it even if it is cheap.,46,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"LOVE this item! Recieved it in the mail faster than i expected. Love that it is hard enough to keep my phone sturdy if i drop it. love the feel of the rubberdized. couldn'tve been any happier. thanks

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,"I bought the case and it was real pretty at first. Then the case began to chip, and now there is barely any print left on the case.",28,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,My wife thinks it's sexy . It fits in there like a glove tight . There is enough of a lip on the front to help protect the screen.,29,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,It came when it was supposed to and works very nicely.  Nice design and rubberization is good too.  Only complaint was that the sides had paint missing when we received it like it either wasn't painted very well or it was painted before it was broken from the mold.  My wife did not want to wait for shipping again so we just kept it. All in all a pretty good product even with the paint chipping because the same type of case would of costed more at the mall even with shipping.,92,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,"Liked the Cover, but it did not fit phone properly.  The little clips broke when I snapped it together. Was cheap though so I guess you get what you pay for.",31,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,2.0,negative,I loved the case when I saw it on Amazon and when it arrived at my house but one side did not fit and no matter what I tried it wouldn't snap.,32,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,4.0,positive,"The case fits securely and is pretty decent. the only complaint i have is i have had it on my phone now for about 3-4 weeks. and the color is already scraping off on the back plate, right in the middle. For the price, im not to disappointed. However I would probably be a little learly on ordering another one. Oh, and its not ""rubberized"" like one may think, its still a plactic cover!",74,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,5.0,positive,"Product arrived quickly, saved me money, perfect fit for my phone will probably order more covers in time from Amazon.  Great service!!!",22,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,1.0,negative,"I didn't buy this thinking it would last me a long time, but I didn't expect it to only last me a month. I had just bought the thunderbolt a few days before purchasing this, so I was looking for something cute to protect my phone. Let's just say this cover is already in the trash. Within a month of buying it, the paint started to wear off the case. If it was only a few minor dings I wouldn't have minded, but these were large chips. Not to mention, the cover is very difficult to remove. One of the plastic grooves actually broke off when I was trying to remove the cover, and now it won't completely shut. I'm very disappointed because I really liked the look and feel of the case, but ultimately it just wasn't a good product. I spent a little more money, and got a better product elsewhere.",153,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0048AO7A2,3.0,neutral,"The case does what it says it does. Has a nice smooth soft feel. Didnt click all the way around so the top does come loose, and its starting to peel after 1.5 months",34,33

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,I have ordered this phone cards for several times already.  It is a great deal to get a 6 months cards for $199.  The delivery was fast and I have not had any issues expect when we are going to see more available for sale?,45,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,Best card I've found for my phone.  I hope to be able to purchase again when needed.  Received before stated time.  Thanks!,22,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"For one, Straight Talk is an amazing service.  Yeah, they don't have the most amazing cutting edge cell phones that are super computers in your pocket, but they use the Verizon towers giving them amazing service (Verizon is the only service that will give me full signal without dead zones where I live in the mountains of the northeast).  They're like the cell phones from several years ago but get the job done very well for a small fraction of the cost.
Now to the card here on Amazon.  It's nice to not have to refill at $45 a month every month.  That's just inconvenient to do.  So they have other options so you don't have to do that.  This is the six month unlimited everything plan, and at the rate of $45 a month it should be $270.  But somehow Amazon can sell it for about $200!  Now that's a deal!  I purchased this card and will continue to do so in the future making my cell phone bill a whopping $33.33 a month on average for unlimited minutes, text and mobile web.  You cannot beat it.  Thank you Amazon!",191,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,I did not recieve my card. PG Sales printed priority mail mailing labels from home but I contacted postal service and they said THERE WAS NO SIGN OF PACKAGE BEING MAILED! They immediately charge your charge card and put delivery date WEEKS after purchase. They do not respond to any emails sent to them. DO NOT BUY FROM PG SALES! THEY ARE A FRAUD!!,64,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"So far I am very pleased with straight talk service, and also PG sales who sold me the card.
Unfortunately, PG sales no longer selling this card on amazon. I hope he comes back.",34,5

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,Why would anyone buy a refill card for 350.00 when it only costs 255.00? That's a rip off...,18,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,Straight Talk says these are not authorized cards and charged my account back for the service. These apparently are stolen cards.,21,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"Great deal but be careful, make sure you buy from reputable dealer.",12,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,Stay away.  My account was deactivated because they said I used a fraudulent card.  I had to call them up and clarify that I got this from Amazon.  Never buy ST refill cards from anyone except authorized dealer from now on.,41,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,Do not buy refill card from seller from individual seller even it is on amazon. They aren't the authroized dealer.

I have waste my money on these refill card. hope you won't fall to the same scam.,68,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"Yes, CardArt sold fraudulent cards. I happened to buy two of them! Since I loaded them as needed, one was actually almost a year old. So I assumed I was out almost $500.

Now here's the good...no, the GREAT...part: Amazon, true to form with their excellent customer service...actually refunded both cards!! Yes, I had to return them at my cost...who wouldn't want to do that, to get a full refund (except for original shipping to me).

I just can't say enough good things about these transactions. Amazon took a hit to keep a customer happy. And I am a very happy long-term customer with Amazon.

OK, on to these cards. Straight Talk is my service and has been for over a year. My whole family has moved there from V....., who was charging an arm and a leg. And I HATE long-term contracts anyway.

So buy your own phone (must be either from Straight Talk or a former AT&T or maybe T-Mobile phone...be sure to read about compatibility, so you buy the right phone) and come on over. The living's fine over on this side!",185,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,"Bad card, caught in the middle, neither Straight Talk nor Amazon will give any satisfaction, deal with ST or Walmart's directly. CardArt is mysteriously missing from Amazon's rogue gallery. Mysteriously missing from everywhere. Tried to save a buck and got burnt.",41,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,"Yes, these cards are fraud. Even if they work for a few months.  Straight Talk will deactivate your phone.  You will have to deal with Straight Talk to turn it back on and it will be the biggest headache of your life.  On the bright side, you will have to deal with Amazon to get a refund and they will back you up 100% and you will wish you could marry them.",72,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,"I redeemed a year refill card around November 1st and the card worked for a couple months. However, today I tried to place a phone call and was told the refill card was stolen. I have not spent an hour on the phone with both Amazon and Straight Talk (TracFone) and still have not received a refund. I would strongly recommend not buying from this seller. I will keep this review updated through the refund process (if I end up receiving a refund).",83,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,Unbelievable ripoff and horrific inconvenience. Phone shut off by Straight Talk with out warning. Be warned. Never by a phone card from here unless you'd like your money to disappear.,30,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,"Like many others, my TWO phones have been disconnected by Straight Talk. These are stolen or purchased with a stolen Credit Card. It makes sense once Straight Talk explained it to me. They ONLY SELL refill cards through Wal-Mart or their website. This seller was selling ST cards at a discount price that must have been purchased from Wal-Mart or ST direct at a retail price. That is very self explanatory. I am out nearly $500 thanks to this scumbag of a thief and also have no phone service during the worst winter weather in the last 30 years at my home. I would love to get a hold of this person's information to seek legal action. These dollar amounts and transactions are FELONIES! My only hope now is Amazon's A-Z assurances and I have high hopes for that considering Amazon's stellar track record of taking care of their costumers.",150,22

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,After receiving the card I entered in the number to extend my plan for 6 month.  Everything looked like it was going smoothly until my phone got cut off a few months later.  I called support to find out why and they said the cards I have purchased have been stolen.  You won't know if the cards is stolen until your phone get cut off.,65,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,This was the best price I have found.  The card activated really quick without any problems.  I would recommend to anyone.,21,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,"In my experience, I was on vacation when my phone got deactivated.
Yes, the price may be good, but do you like to be stranded?
It's probably not worth the savings of a few bucks a month if it means you are out of luck and can't make a phone call in the event that you do need to.",59,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,1.0,negative,Straight talk deactivated everyone who bought these cards (over the last 3 months) on the day after Christmas.  There was a news story about a person who stole these cards from Walmart and then pretended to be a Walmart supervisor. [...],41,27

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"I was able to purchase this item for half a Benjamin less than the value printed on the front of the card from one of Amazon's sellers. It was an awesome deal for 6 months of service. I switched from AT&T to Straight Talk (which still uses AT&T) and I cannot tell the difference between the two services. Well, other than my bill being half of what it previously used to be :)

I highly recommend.",76,31

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,not to much to say about this deal other than awesom.. saved $50 by buying this pre paid card.  not to mention when using the pre pay card you don't pay monthly tax on the straight talk bill.,38,34

and wait 24-48 hours before my phone gets re-activated, plus I was on hold for 30 minutes!
DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!!!!! IF IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT USUALLY IS!

UPDATING-JANUARY 6, 2014-Okay. Finally received txt from Straighttalk, powered phone off and back on and have service restored.

But be warned that Straight Talk's unlimited data is actually not, throttled or cut out of data service did happen to someone else. I think they should just be straight-forward and say that 1.5G or 2G limit at high speed, and after that reduced speed or something like other carriers would do and won't get many angry users.",78,42

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,I ordered 2 of these 6 month refill cards for $219 each. Both arrived within a few days and I added the time to my straight talk account without any issues. Saved $50 each vs the walmart price.,38,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"All that money up front is steep, but over the long haul (6 months), you save over a months cost. I fully recommend it if you can.",27,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,Product was activated very quickly.  They requested my phone number and within an hour I had 6 months added to my phone.  Loved it.  I did not have to added it myself.,32,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"Super cheap and quick to install on Straighttalk Phone.  No problems with the code.  All was legitimate.  $33 bucks/mo for unlimited phone service!  Awesome.  I know some people are upset that Straighttalk is not truly unlimited, but that is really a non-issue especially if you use Wii-Fii when it is available or you want to watch movies.",57,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,Great price for the product and it is well packaging. I cannot wait to see more of this product with this great price.,23,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"I admit I was nervous about purchasing this card at $220 but it worked as advertised.  I purchased this to work with the Samsung Proclaim I ordered from WalMart.  It was also my first service card so for anyone looking to start with StraightTalk this will work.  The phones come with an activation card and then you need to link your service card to the phone (either on their website which is what I did or by calling a number from another phone).  All in all it was very straight forward and of course saved me a bundle.

I will buy this again in 6 months when it's time to refill.",111,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,4.0,positive,"have been ST customer for 3+ months and like them a lot.  I use ST ""auto pay"" feature so the bill is paid automatically every month.  How could I use a card like this to pay 6 months at once?  Thanks.",41,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"I bought two cards from Cardart for $219 each.  I received the cards in 3 days and immediately logged onto my Straight talk account and added the pin numbers.  As fast as I hit the enter key, I was instantaneously sent a text letting me know the the first card was accepted.  Ditto for card number two.  The text and my online account indicated that I am paid for the next 12 months until May 2014.

My Google Nexus 4 phone with straight talk on AT&T cost $755 for the year and I could reuse my old chargers from my last phone.  If I pay full price on the straight talk website for next year it will cost an additional $540 to bring my 2 year total to $1,295.

For comparison, an iPhone 5 with unlimited talk/text and 3 GB of data per month will cost $3,116 for a 2 year commitment on AT&T  (that doesn't include buying their proprietary charging cords).  Let's see, pay $3,116 for 2 years of an iPhone, or pay $1,235 an get a free all-inclusive Caribbean vacation valued at $1,821 and a a Google Nexus 4.  Have fun being trendy iPhone users, I'll be on my free vacation with the money I saved:o",208,55

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,This refill card worked perfectly. My refill went through without a hitch. It extended my service another 6 months as advertised. This turns out to be a great deal compared to buying refill cards at Wal Mart all the time. Excellent Deal and product!,44,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,I have switched over to straight talk a little over 6 months ago and have nothing but great things to say about it. I switched from AT&T and save half of what I paid for.....for the SAME cell service! I have traveled extensively throughout the midwest and have not lost service.,51,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"Who can dislike saving money on their cell phone service?  I buy these cards with Amazon Prime when they go on sale and my friends are all amazed by how little I pay per month.  The cards are legit, as I've refilled my Straight Talk account with one, no problem.  When you buy with Prime, there's no risk.",58,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"This 6-month card works great for extending your StraightTalk service. The seller only puts these up for sale every few weeks on Amazon, but when they do, it's about 20% less than the $270 retail price... you can't beat it. A physical card arrived promptly within a few days of purchasing, with an unscratched PIN, I quickly scratched it and added it to my girlfriend's plan extending her service 6 additional months. Seems like below negative reviews reference a higher price being charged than the $270... however again, that was not the case when I purchased this (mine was $219.99).

You can purchase this same card at Walmart or on StraightTalk.com, but not for the price offered here. I've rated 5 stars for the best price I've found on a 6 month ST card and for quick shipping. I hope more become available soon so I can stock up!",149,62

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,Straight Talk refills cards have the best value of all refill cards. Better than Net 10. (My previous cell provider).,20,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004AYZKE8,5.0,positive,"Straight talk data is slower than I expected, but the price is unbeatable.

 If you buy this six month card for $220 from amazon, you will end up paying $35 a month for unlimted everything, which is pretty sweet.  Even with slower than regular ATT 3g speeds, you still get the extensive coverage area that comes with ATT all for a fraction of the cost.

Works great with the iPhone.",70,65

That's the only down side to the case. For the price I would expect the quality I got which wasn't perfect. I love the look but don't use it too often because it if kind of bulky. Otherwise it's a fun, cool, and different case I like to use when I switch my phone cases!",82,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,"Love the old school feel of this for my iPod. Like every single person has already said... It does NOT have an opening on it for you to charge it with the case on so if that's what you really, really want; you're not going to find it on this.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"Pros:

In looks it is very cute. Stylish and a bit odd. People have mistaken it fromo the back as a tape.

The rubber is more protective than I thought it would be

Cons:

It doesn't have an opening at the bottom for you to plug your phone recharger into.",50,4

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,"Cute but loose on my iPhone 5. My phone falls off and it happens to fall right in the corner where the case accidentally slipped off. It's not a very secure protection for my phone. This was the main reason why I bought it. I also got it because it was cute, but if I had known I could scratch my phone with it, I would've gotten something else.
The colors are still as good as new, the print is also great.... But it's not a secure case for my phone.",91,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,It looks exactly as the picture.  I would only suggest that these cases come with something to allow a cord of some sort to hold it to your wrist at least.  Very cool look!,34,16

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,Love these cases purchased one in about 4 different colors. cases are true to color (as pictured). I Get so many compliments on them. Love the rubber because i doesn't scratch my phone like hard plastic. Dropped my phone a few times and they did a beautiful job of protecting my phone. Only downside is after awhile the rubber becomes worn and starts to loose its form and fit. Would like to see them made in a gel rubber whic seems to hold it's shape better. =),87,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,I love my phone case. It is my favorite color and at times had me tricked on whether or not if it was an actual cassette tape when my screen part was faced down.,34,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,The case was for some reason designed to cover the port for charging your phone. So when I need to charge my phone I have to take the case off. It was a great idea and it looks really cool!,40,22

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"Its okay, cool looking!

Pros: Cool looking

Cons: If phone is in your pocket make sure there is nothing in that pocket because the minute you pull your phone out everything is going with it including your pocket lol other than that its okay. I do prefer hard case over silicone but its whatever",54,25

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"I really loved the way this cover looked. It didn't offer much for protection so if you're a little rough with your phone I wouldn't recommended it but for me, it was perfect! The only complaint I have is there is no hole in the bottom for the charger or a hole for the earbuds. I don't use earbuds with my phone so that wasn't a big deal and since the rubber is flexible pulling it back to plug in the charger was no big deal. If you're like me, and talk on your phone while it's charged, I recommend cutting a small space with an X-actor knife to make space for the charger. But you can't beat it for the price!! Hopefully they'll continue making these for future iPhone models because I'd definitely repurchase!",135,32

It's very cheap, very floppy/flimsy, and it doesn't even my iPhone4 like it should. It's larger than the phone itself and really square along the edges. It would probably fit better if the corners were filled to fit the rounded corners of the iP4/4s but it's not.

The case is slightly big, but just by a smidge. I've dropped my phone quite a few times and the rubberized casing absorbs the shock to protect your phone. I am certainly satisfied",89,76

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"My daughter loves this because of how it looks, not how it protects her phone.  It really does look like a cassette tape.  There is not slot for her charger and she has to take it off to charge her iPhone.  So far, it hasn't stretched out, but I think it will.",52,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,These cases tend to stretch after a while considering its silicon. They fit a little funny because the cases a very rectangled (especially at the corners). Over all it was an okay case. I can't complain given the price.,39,85

It.",25,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"Don't use this for protection. Its sort of flimsy but it looks great.

It is only for show! Your iPhone will really look like a cassette tape from the back, as opposed to other phone case designs, the iPhone is the actual size of an old cassette tape. So it is believable.",52,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,It's a fun looking case and the delivery was pretty fast. Another case to add to the collection and easy to put on and take off for changing depending on my mood and outfit :),35,93

The only thing I would have to complain about would be on the bottom of the case there is no open spot for you to plug in your charger, so that is very inconvenient. However, like I said before you get you get what you pay for. Lastly, the case is not a hard one, it is silicone.",85,94
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,Arrived before expected delivery date. The case is very cute but it doesn't stay on my phone (lose fit) there is no cut out for the charger. Not good for protection but very stylish,34,95

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,It's very cute and I loved it. The only flaw is that there was no opening in the bottom to charge my phone so I had to take it off each time I needed to charge it. The buttons on the side weren't lined up either,46,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,"For only like 2 dollars, this case is pretty decent! It fits to my phone, and it was the color that was shown. The port holes are all there, and they line up perfectly! Love it!",36,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,I bought this for my sister. She really likes it the only thing I don't like is it has no cut outs so you have to take the bottom off to charge,32,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,Not a big fan of rubber cases!!But u get what u pay for!!!Cool case for a child!!Ilm going to give it to my niece when she gets an iphone4,29,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,This thing is so cute! It slips off really easily and I was unaware that the back had holes (the two circles and the rectangular are holes and I can see the back of my phone which bothers me sooo much). But other than that it's absolutely adorable and I love it! It hasn't torn or anything and... Yeah. Hope that helps! :),63,104

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"The only good thing about this case is its aesthetic value. It has no practical value whatsoever because there is no opening for your charger and the holes for the lock button don't really line up. It also makes the phone look really rectangular, like the edges aren't curved, they're more sharp with this case, so if that's not something you like then you shouldn't get this case. I mean for $1 you get what you paid for. I only use it if I'm going out at night, but it's not an everyday, protective kind of case.",97,107
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,"First of all, the seller sent a pink case instead of purple. I won't bother contacting the seller to and go through all that crap to get another case that's just as crappy as this one. This case is super flimsy rubber and there are holes in the case as decoration. It doesn't cling to the phone, and it won't protect it from dirt. Even the tape design on it is buffed out in some places. So this case failed at all of the reasons for buying a phone case. On the bright side, it was cheap; but it certainly wasn't a steal.",103,108
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"Okay, not a good quality case. It doesn't fit my phone well, it's kind of loose. It did arrive fasten then expected but not the best case but good price though.",31,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,It is really cool. I have no idea why it is listed as purple/blue because it is a very pretty purple. I love it and just wish that it was maybe a bit sturdier.,34,110
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"I honestly wasn't expecting much since the price is so low.
Its flimsy. It rips. the paint rubs off.
The corners are thick, which I like because they absorb some of the impact from falls.

Overall, its good. Its cute.
Ill recommend it for a temporary case. Just don't make it your all the time case.",56,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"Let me first say, i bought this case knowing i was paying a dollar for it, so not having super high expectations.

Now the purple color of the case is super pretty. But the fit is a bit off, and the case kind of sticks out in the back.

There is NO charging hole, so you do have to pull the case off to charge the phone. So my phone ends up being out of the case as often as it is in it.

But all in all, the case is pretty and serves its purpose of being cool.",99,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,Everything turned out the exact way it was expected to come and no damage! I also received it on time! Great product!!,22,113

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"This product is really cheaply made, roughly fits the 4s not very precise cuts for iphone controls. For the price I guess its ok, I would not buy another one it does not protect the phone.",36,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,"I ordered this case as well as a pink one. The purple one was for my teenage sister in law. When I received the case I was pleased with how it looked but the bottom did not have a slot to plug in the charger. It was just solid the whole way across, the top was the same with only a hole to plug in the headphones. I was really annoyed by this but luckily my sister in law didn't mind and just takes the case off to charge it. The pink one I ordered, however, did have the slot to plug in the charger. Not sure why there was a difference. I gave this cases three stars because when the case is on it really does look like a tape and my sister in law really enjoys using it. If it had the slot for the charger it would of received 5 stars.",154,116
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,"This is my favorite of all the cases that I have bought, its original and just awesome!  My only complaint is its just a tad bit flimsy and loose, its needs to be a little more secur fitting to stay on the phone, other wise I love it!",48,117
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,"After reading all the product reviews for this I have to admit I wasn't sure if I wanted to make this purchase.  But I loved how it looked and for the price you honestly can't complain because it was only a few bucks.  When I recieved it I wasn't expecting much but to my surprise I'm actually very satisfied with this product.  It fit my iPhone perfectly, the holes line up correctly, and it has an opening on the bottom for the charger & speakers.  The only bad thing about this product is that it probably won't last very long.  But once again like mentioned before you get what you pay for so I didn't expect to have the case for years or anything like that.  I'm completly satisfied with the fact that it fits my phone like a glove, everyone asks where I got it from because they love it, and it was cheap.  It definitley will serve its purpose for as long as it lasts.",167,118
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,3.0,neutral,I really like this cover for the iphone. People complement me on it all the time. The only issues that I have with it is that it is a bit loose for my iphone 4. I feel like my phone is just going to slip out of it sometimes. Another thing is that the cover doesn't have an opening on the bottom to charge my phone. I have to take it out of the case in order to charge my phone which is a bit of a pain at times. Overall it's a super cute cover that for the money it's worth it and does the job.,107,119
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,2.0,negative,"I bought this case because it looked really cool. It looks nice in person, but the holes in the back make your phone prone to scratches, but that problem can easily solved by putting a screen shield on the back of the phone. The biggest problem I had with the case was the fact that it doesn't fit snug on the phone, it was really loose and I could slide my phone around in it.

Not very functional, but it's a cool novelty.",83,120
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,Awesome case and the case is made of a really good rubber! Looks really neat. People will probably ask where you got it!,23,121
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"I really enjoy this case, even though its not made to protect my phone at a high standard. Made of rubber. The color is bright, which i love. It fits pretty nicely, but not a perfect fit. It fits every part of the iPhone 4s, Verizon, and is a good back-up case. Got it at a very low price so i thought id give it a shot. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a fun case.",77,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,"I was a little worried about ordering after reading some of the reviews, but this cover couldn't have worked out better.  It fit perfectly on my iPhone 4s (Verizon CDMA).  The holes and buttons lined up perfectly, AND there was a cut out on the bottom for my charger so I wouldn't have to take the cover when I charge.  Like others have said, it's probably not the case to get if you're expecting long term durability and protection.  But the cover I received looks just like the picture and seems to be pretty durable, which is nice considering how inexpensive it is, not to mention that it looks really cool on my iPhone.",114,123
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,5.0,positive,"This is a great phone cover, the silicon is helpful when you always carry your phone in your pocket because it won't slip out.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"This phone cover is an awesome conversation piece.
It protects your phone and prevents it from slipping out
of your hand. The only down side is that you have to take
off the cover to charge the phone, there is no hole.  Small
inconeince for such a cool case.",49,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,1.0,negative,"This case is extrememly cheap! First off, there was no opening for my charger. How are you supposed to charge/sync your iPhone without an opening to the port? Take off the case each time? I don't think so!!! Secondly, the holes that were cut for buttons and speakers were NOT lined up, at all! There are holes in random places and I can't access any of the buttons. Thirdly, the case looks much differently than it does in the photo. The cassette is cheaply printed on, and looks as if it would easily wear off.

I refuse to use this item, and don't suggest it to anyone!!",107,126

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DM0S1M,4.0,positive,"I have the white iPhone and this fits great!  Yes, you have to take the skin off to charge, but that's in the description so it's not a surprise.  The openings are all in the right place (I'm on Verizon so I don't know if this makes a difference) and the volume buttons work, so that hasn't been a problem for me.  Really my only complaint is that I would like to keep the skin on while charging, but it's really not that big of a deal to me.  For $5 this is a great product.",96,128

It came in a basically unmarked plastic bag with only the company name on it. i took it out and it was laughably smaller than my iphone 4. it didn't fit at all, no matter how much we tried to stretch it on. i ended up having to throw it away.",59,129
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,"I love these headphones. I hated using a regular bluetooth because I feel like it's going to fall off and I can never get it on my ear. I hated wearing regular headphones while running or at the gym because the cord would always get in the way. Now I don't have to worry about either! I have a Droid 2 and setting these up on my phone was a breeze. The sound is pretty great (considering) and they stay on even through my toughest of workouts. I love them in the car because I drive a jeep and I have horrible sound insulation in there. I can hear the people on the other end perfectly with these. I highly recommend. They're a great product for a pretty good price.

P.S. Here's an extra tip: Don't bother paying for the $34.99 ones. The only difference is you get is a cleaning cloth. So not worth the extra $5.",158,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,"Got these today, charged them up and they paired pretty easily with my iphone 4.  One thing that I had a little problem was in the pairing, the lights need to be flashing both blue and red.  They were just flashing blue and I couldn't pair.  I re-read the instructions and in my rush I missed the point that it needs to be flashing red and blue to be in pairing mode.  Once it was done, connected like a charm.  The controls worked fine also to skip songs.  I used them on the treadmill for a 40 min run and had no problems.  So happy to be able to run without the cord bouncing against me.  The sound quality is decent, not pro quality, but good.  Overall very satisfied.",129,1

Only negative is the USB Cord. It is not a standard Micro or Mini plug, which means that you have to carry this charger in addition to my phone charger.

Device works great on HTC Evo 4G",75,2

You tend to press too hard, since it's not obvious whether you're making contact or not.  So then, in a few months, the switch is likely to break.

Good sound quality and fewer problems with the ear bud covers. BUT after only a few months, the rubber cover that protects the ""recharging port"" came off. Not long after that, the device stopped charging. I assume without protection, moisture and/or dirt got inside that port and caused it to stop charging.

So I went without my blue tooth until my birthday, and received a Motorolla device! Great, right?? No. It had problems from the very beginning.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,1.0,negative,"Let me start off by saying, I had high hopes for these headphones. They are a great price and were super comfortable. Sound quality wasn't great, but it was acceptable for headphones in this price range. With that said, I quickly had my hopes let down by this product. The design of this product is an epic fail! the headphones have toggle switches which are exposed to the environment. This causes sweat to build up and cause a short. Once the toggle switch fails, you can no longer turn the device on or off. This effectively makes them useless. Mine failed within 3 weeks of use. It was a total bummer, but amazon gave me my money back.

Overall fails on this device:
1) Not a bit of water resistance
2) The device uses a propriety cable, so you can't charge it with a normal micro USB.
3) The sound quality is okay, but lacked low / high end sound. The speakers are very  geared toward midrange tones.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,"The go groove is OK for a cheap headset.  Here are the things I DO NOT like...  the power switch/mode switch is integrated into the volume switch and it is really a pain in the butt to use.  It is sometimes hard to pair up to my phone (I have a motorola droid running 2.2).

It is not comfortable to wear for any length of time (more than an hour and you're ready to take it off)...  it rubs the rims of my ears funny... especially if I'm trying to use it with sunglasses on...  so much for taking this thing running to get rid of the cable to my headphones.  I now pretty much only use it to listen to music  while I work out.  As long as you don't mind that it hangs off the back of your head about 2-3 inches (it's really oversized and non-adjustable) then it's great for that.

Using it for phone calls... the mic does not have noise cancelling, so it catches wind noise really bad (even from my car vents), and if you use it to call... then you have to turn it off, unpair it, and then turn it back on and repair it in order to hear music again...  this does not happen with my motorola blue-tooth... just this one, so I'm pretty sure it's the headset, not my phone.  If you don't like that fact, then you'll have to either pay more for a better headset or just have this for music and something else for hands-free calls (not exactly convenient).

I usually watch a number of Pod cast on my phone and for this reason theses ear buds are fine, they do the job, hold a charge for a few days and I just throw them in my backpack with no problems. But I also like my tunes and for this they're not so good, unless the volume is turned down to a very low setting ( which I can not do on the subway ) they sound very tinny/cheap. I have also tried using them when I walk my dog in the evening and well maybe it's me but again unless turn down they again don't sound so good. But as for using them with my phone, very good, my friends tell me no background noise even when walking down a busy street or standing on a subway platform. I've also had them out in the rain with no damage. So if you're looking for an entry level Bluetooth headset this may be it for you, low price point.

I haven't been able to get the buds to fit ""in"" my ears, even with the different buds they included.  I read a review from a bike rider who complained about the same issue that caused air noise when he rode fast.  Mine would not allow me to answer my phone when I was listening to Sirius/XM or Pandora while running, sporadically.  My biggest complaint is that, a few weeks ago, my headset will not turn off.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,2.0,negative,"I bought these earbuds about 6 months ago and immediately loved them. The fit was good, controls were simple and it made my workouts MUCH more enjoyable not having to worry about wires hanging all over the place. For the first 3 or 4 months I told EVERYONE how great these things were. Then...

After a mild run (30 mins) on an unseasonably warm day, I had these things dripping in sweat. Mind you, I didn't submerge them in water or anything, just sweat. I laid them out for a full day before I attempted to recharge them to make sure they were entirely dry. When the time came, they wouldn't take a charge, pair, or even turn on. They're now a paperweight sitting on my desk. Everything started so well...

You have to hold the power button down a little awkwardly long, but that's an easy thing to get used to. They come with three different sized ear pieces and even after putting on the largest ones they will still slip out the moment I start to sweat. I actually run with the ear buds hanging loosely against my ears (rather than in my ear canal), which works perfectly well.

I bought these about 3 months ago wanting to go wireless as I hate running with wires, but I'm not sure these were the best option. I'll keep this short and sweet. From a technical standpoint they work great and do what they are supposed to. I'd give them 5 stars in that category. From a functionality standpoint, they come up way short. If you wanted something to just wear around the house, these would be fine. But if you are looking at these for running, working out, or anything where you are moving or sweating, I'd say move on. Because of the design you have to bend these to get them to put them on, and after doing this a few times I've found you constantly have one side coming out of your ear, and are having to stick it back in over and over. If you get sweat on the ear buds you can forget about it. I've tried to bend them inward but to no avail. It can make for quite a frustrating experience. I'd give them 1.5 stars in the functionality category. If you are looking for something for exercise look elsewhere. I wish I had went with the LG Tone and will probably purchase them in the near future. I wish you could give half stars I'd give an overall of 2.5. Since I can't I'm just giving them 3 since technically they do work.",255,119

This is why I purchased this.  My earbuds I buy for my iPhone fall out as sweat pours out.  Also, having corded earbuds results in them getting yanked out during workouts.

Just got this yesterday, and went right to the gym.  Did a full workout, and they worked perfectly.  They stay in my ears, and I can hear it well.

I also wore them on my motorcycle with my 3/4 helmet, and it provided nice sound while riding my bike.

Until recently, where the headset's own product design started to cause it to break.

Right around the earbuds, there are holes in the plastic casing, most likely to help with flexibility, but these holes are RIGHT on the stress points, so if you bend them when taking them off, chances are they will last about as long as mine did, maybe even less.

Synced immediately with my LG Optimus Elite Droid.

The bad:
After my initial battery charge, it no longer would charge (using either the supplied power pack or my computer).  While plugged in, the LED didn't illuminate, nor did any recharging occur.
Somewhat uncomfortable.  The ear piece didn't surround my ear, rather, it crossed over the top if it.  After a long listening session, my ear got sore.

I keep hoping that the next pair that I buy will be different and hold the charge better, but I end up disappointed.  Make sure that you register your product with Accessory Power within the first 30 days of purchase, or you won't be eligible for the 3 year warranty.

The headphones pair quickly, have pretty good range when connected to my HTC Evo 4G, and I love the controls for the volume and track forward and reverse buttons.  The fit is great.  They fit over the ears and the earbuds provide a snug fit in the ears to block out most noises.  I wear them when I'm mowing the grass and can hear music or podcasts without problem.

But eventually, without warning, the battery just dies and I cannot recharge them.  I have spoken with reps from Accessory Power.  They state that they are aware of the problem and are attempting to improve battery life with future versions.  The last 2 pair that I have purchased have failed after 20 days and 32 days, respectively, from the date that I received them.

I mainly used it for my gym workout when it worked. during the 2nd month of ussage the only way to power off the item was to severed the blue tooth connection and it would eventually time itself off. ended up in the trash after it started making beeping sounds every 5 minutes even after being fully charged. back to regular wire earbuds but at least I don't waste time getting this thing to work.

The only thing that I think should be fixed is that maybe have the mic be more pronounced or at least point it out. I STILL have no clue where the microphone is located! With that said be sure there is NO background noise when you talk because the mic will pick it up and the people you are talking to will definitely hear it, even if you don't.

You're always going to have someone that has some issue with the product.  I decided to go with this headset and am very glad I did.  I have experienced NONE of the issues reported by some other buyers.  I have an iPhone 3GS and the headset paired quickly with the phone.  I am no audiophile, but the sound quality is as good as any wired headsets I have used in the past.

Durability: (0/5) maybe I'm just unlucky but reading the reviews it appears to happen often, it worked for me for one charge only, when it ran out of battery I was not able to charge it again with either wall connector or via USB.  the charge did last 10 days with ~1 hour usage every day.
Sound: ** (2/5)

Overall: * (1/5) inexpensive product that seems to work just like any other competing products, it worked okay when it did, died after 10 days of usage, now sits on top of a pile of stuffs I can/will no longer use.

Pros:
* I liked the fit
* sound was ok (but not great) once ear buds were securely in ear
* Bluetooth range seemed ok to me (no dropouts with Droid Phone on arm band).

Cons:
* Uses proprietary USB connector on the headphone end.  These means I can't use one of the many Mini or Micro USB cords I have lying around to charge it.
* Broke after less than 2 months.

We bought another one, so we each could use them. I have small ears, and some ear buds make my ears hurt. This one is perfect for me. Comes with three sizes of ear pieces. They seem to ""suction"" in your ear when placed appropriately.  I have used them to walk, run, elliptical, bike, and weight lifting.  The Bluetooth sync if easy.

I have no problem pairing them with my Droid X and the sound was okay, not outstanding but okay. The headphones are design to rest on your ears and then you have to push the ear buds into your ears. This design is flawed only because when i would move at all (which i happen to move alot when i work out)the ear buds did not stay in my ears. To clarify, the headphones stayed on my head, while the ear buds would fall out, greatly reducing comfort and music quality. So bottom line is that if you want a pair of headphones for when you are not moving alot, they i would say, consider these as a last resort, but other than that, i say avoid these",148,179

I use them with my Lifeproof case to eliminate the need for wired headphones. I have the sports arm band and all during my run the music played without any drop outs. I can even skip songs without stopping just using the headset. I have not yet received any calls on these,but when I do I will update this to let you know how they work for calls. As for the music,they work fine. This is one purchase I am very happy I made. I would recommend these. Oh yeah I also used them when I was cleaning house and I could go from room to room without losing signal. Grant it I never went more then 20 feet from the Iphone.

The sound was bad and they did not hold a charge.  But GOgroove stated would work on a long list of brand names such as Apple, and because I wanted them for my iPad I ordered them.  They have stereo sound, long charge capability and it doesn't take long to charge when they do need one.  And one other big thing, the other headsets, I had to re-pair every time I used them, very inconvenient.  But with GOgroove, once they have been paired you have only to turn them on, and your ready to go.  So I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE HEADSETS.  Have an iPad or iPod? use these.  They also have great customer service; I've used them and they got back to me IMMEDIATELY and fixed the problem within no time.

The controls are easy to use which is nice but the sound quality is absolutely horrible.  There is absolutely zero bass and everything sounds washed out.  If you are looking for some decent wireless headphones/headset and you don't need ones which are water/sweat resistant then look at Plantronics Backbeat 903+.

Recently, the headset doesn't seem to want to stay connected. I use this primarily for a cordless headset when excercising, and it is constanly cutting out - very distracting when running and music is cutting in/out.

I'm useing it with 3rd Gen Ipod touch.  Someone else mentioned in their review that the sound can cut in and out.  This is true, but mainly seems to be related to the position of the ipod.  When I have it in my pocket and I bend over putting my Ipod between my leg and stomach for example the signal seemsto get blocked or at east temporally interupted. It also happens but less often in a back pocket.  It can also in a breast pocket if you cross your arms over you chest to tight.  Again these seem to be quick signal interuptions and if you aware of the movements you can minimize them.  If I'm working in a room and just leave it on a shelf it works just fine with almost no interuption. In fact I'd say you can walk as much as 30ft from the Ipod without losing signal.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,"As the title above proclaims, this is the very first time I am writing a review on Amazon - even though I am an ardent fan of Amazon.

The headphones (two) were meant to be Christmas gifts for my 19 year old son and adult daughter- they are both very athletic and I thought they could use it when working out. However, they both preferred another brand that has a built in MP3 player and does not need a phone/iPod to Bluetooth connect with and play music.

SO - I gifted 1 headset to my nephew who stays glued to the cell phone and I kept the other one for myself. I took mine for my 3 hour uphill hike yesterday and listened to music the entire time. Here is my review ....

Very easy to pair with my Android phone
I did not have to charge it before use - it came charged
Music Quality is good. I am not very discriminating when it comes to listening to music. So I cannot comment on the audio quality. For the price I paid and the purpose it will serve, I am very satisfied.
Good Quality of Voice calls - better than the hands free calling from my Acura.
This hike usually takes me 3.5 hours - with the headphones yesterday I did it in 3 hours! (Not sure if it was because of the headphones or the gr8 massage I got before the hike).

I will update this post in a few months once I have experienced the battery life and the durability of the product.",266,244
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,"This device is absolutely great for listening to your music with very good sound quality (incoming). However, it does not pickup your voice very well when speaking to callers (outgoing). I just got so tired of people asking me to repeat myself. In addition to that, it frequently times out or goes to sleep (power off) if not used for 20 minutes or more. So when a call comes thru I have to try to find the power button to turn it back on....by the way, the power button is not easy to press down to power up the device.

Conclusion: If you're only looking for a device to play your music via bluetooth while working out or walking about, this is an excellent choice. If you're looking to also use it for talk time, please do so with caution and expect to repeat yourself often!",146,245

I will be using them mainly for music during outdoor runs. Sound seemed fine and more importantly it seems like they will stay put as I run. I have tried three different styles of wired earbuds and they have all fallen out. Very annoying. The new Bluetooth set up should solve the problem.,77,247
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,3.0,neutral,"My main reason for getting the GoGroove headphones was to be able to workout and listen to music without snagging the headphone cable. Distance from phone to headset is never greater than a couple of feet (my Samsung Infuse stays in my shorts pocket) I found that power lines can interfere with music playback.  The first day I used the headsets I tossed them to the side after about 20 minutes of horrific start/stop playback.  I initially wrote a scathing review then stopped to consider the environment and realized my workout was right underneath a hefty powerline so I waited until I gave them another go.
Today I tried them again at a different location. Playback was hugely improved but still subject to stop/start as I neared powerlines.
Pros:
 - Cheap price.
 - No wires.
Cons:
 - Earpieces need to be constantly pushed back into place.  Seems to be tension on the unit that naturally causes that.  A headband might help.
 - Playback isn't perfect.  Expect to have music interrupted a few times per song.
 - Charging cable is non-standard.
 - Headset feels odd.  Maybe it's the shape of my head/ears but I really do prefer the feel of my old sport headphones better.

Overall impression (from a music playback perspective) is ""meh"".... I'll use them until they break but won't run out to replace them.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,5.0,positive,"I am truly impressed with these Bluetooth headphones. I read many reviews of other brands, and the thing that turned me away from the others was the complaints about sweat getting inside and shorting out the headphones. Well, I read reviews about the GOgroove head phones and did not find any complaints about this issue so I decided to buy them.

After using these headphones 5 days a week for the past 2 months I can confidently say that there are no issues with sweat getting inside this headset. I run 4 days a week and lift weights 3 days a week with each session lasting from 45 min to 1 hr, so these have been exposed to a lot of sweat and they hold up well.  I do not have any issues with sweat getting inside nor does the sweat deteriorate the durability of the material it is made out of. They are a high quality product.

Also, the Bluetooth works very well. I used them with my iPhone 3GS and now with my iPhone 4s and the headset connects perfectly with both phones. I can answer phone calls, change my songs and adjust the volume all from the headset. With an investment of around $30-$40 dollars, I expected less from them.  I recommend these to anyone looking for a solution to the wired headphones that get snagged and pulled out of your ears while you work out. At this price they are the best value out there.",249,251

When I touch the control to forward the next song, it will take a couple of seconds before it would forward and sometimes make think I did not do it correctly and forward it again.  It would forward too much with the slow snyc.  Second, the only bad part was trying to fit it comfortablely especially if I am wearing glasses.

The wrap around bar is hard (thought it was a soft wire) which as I expected and have had problems with Motorola's bluetooth sport headphone's they bounce when running or moving a lot and if you're laying on a weight bench or trying to stretch you should just take them off because they will continue to fall away from your ears. Sound was good, battery life I couldn't tell you because they would no longer charge after using them twice. Overall not worth the hassle, if you want good bluetooth stereo headphones look elsewhere.

Other than the bulkiness they are really convenient to have.  I love that there's no wires attached.  In fact, I almost forget my iPhone on the machines at the gym because of it, so be careful with that gym members.  The best part about these bluetooth headphones is that i can get calls and talk with them on with no problems.  Another thing though is that when I workout with them, the do slip out my ears a little cause of the sweat.  I have found myself pushing them back in.  They won't fall off though.

I just have to adjust them and work them around my ears a bit when putting them on. They don't fall off and do stay in place no matter what activity I am doing. They do slip out of the ear but I think that is because I need to try a different size ear piece on them.

They are okay for just walking around the house but once the jostling/sweating starts they fall right out.  During a run I had to just take them off because they were that distracting.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004DR8PW6,4.0,positive,"I purchased these headphones to use while exercising and to prevent any further episodes where my arm catches my headphone cable and makes my iPod go flying across the gym while running. They arrived quickly and included an appropriate AC wall wart and USB charging cable.

This item sync'd quickly and played back well with my iPhone 3GS, iPod touch, and my friend's iPhone 3G.

The sound quality is decent, but is helped out a little bit by the effective noise sealing of the earphones themselves.

The device is much lighter than I expected it to be, and the weight is not something I notice at all during use. The design is not uncomfortable to me, but I wouldn't describe it as comfortable either. Behind the neck headbands tend to have issues when performing exercises while laying on your back. The whole unit is very stiff to put on and take off, and I'm hoping it loosens up a bit with use.

Bluetooth range is more than I need. I sat my iPod down and walked about 18 feet away while listening to music with no issues. For the gym or running it is more than adequate.

Control interface is simple: one volume +, power, volume - rocker, and another for rw, pause, ff. Pressing the center position of each rocker switch is a challenge given their size and the fact that you might be running while trying to do it, but it hasn't limited me in any way. Push power to turn the unit on, hold it down to put it into sync mode, select it on your device, and it's ready to go!

great and fits great (thanks to the different sized earpieces that are included). I use it for music at the gym and a headset for the ps3.

Not a debilitating problem because it's still a great product and the unit can easily be adjusted back once you stand up. I'm not an audiophile so the sound quality is sufficient for my needs but others may be left wanting.

TIP: I've been able to use it with an Iphone 2G even though it doesn't have A2DP by dialing *#307# to activate a ""call"". Pair the headset, dial the number, answer the call on the headset, answer the call on the phone, select the headset as the audio source, then ipod away.",216,312

The product is ""great""... EXCEPT

1) ... if you move, the audio starts skipping.  As long as you just sit there on the couch, you'll get reasonable connectivity ( >90% ), but if you plan to go walking, go to the gym, get up to grab a soda, etc. then expect to miss every 3rd or 4th  word of a song.  The more you move, the worse it gets.  I bought this for use at the gym, but simply can not use it there - just doesn't work right.

2) the ""phone"" connection is impractical.  Although set up is easy, and you can hear a caller GREAT (this is outstanding), the caller cannot hear you at all... THEY lose about half of what you say.  So you can listen to Voice Mail with the thing, but cannot make or receive calls with any kind of effectiveness.

The idea is great and the technology exists to make this device actually DO everything it claims - but this seems more like a ""Proto-type"" or ""Beta-Test"" kind of device and shouldn't be on the consumer market.

sound (6/10) : it's not the best. but then again, i wasn't expecting hifi on cordless headset.  definitely not for audiophiles.  having said that, it's not that bad for the rest of us.

it's quite usable for phone conversations as well.  microphone picks up sounds quite well... i am told.

comfort (8/10) : out of the box, it's pretty stiff.  if you wear glasses, it's a bit uncomfortable.  but that's given with any behind the ear device.
once you break it in a bit, you don't notice it too much.  as for running, it stays in place and does not bounce.

bluetooth performance is somewhat lacking in strength in signal.  i'm not sure what class bluetooth device this is, but i'd be surprised if it's rated at class 2.  it's really limted to perhaps 3-4 feet. sometimes when i'm running, the sound drops for a split second here and there.  also, when connected to my desktop computer in front of my treadmill, at about 4 feet out, i experience 1-2 second delay in audio.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004E7EKV0,2.0,negative,"I really liked the idea of this case:  Small with multiple pockets for phone, headphones, cables, etc.  Unfortunately, while the idea is definitely right, the execution is inadequate in several ways.

First, the clip is poorly mounted and located.  As described elsewhere, it's mounted with two small rivets, so I'm anticipating tear-out before too long.  But the big one for me is that the clip is mounted too low on the back of the unit.  As a result, when the case is clipped on to anything (like a belt or pocket), it tends to sag off to one side instead of hanging straight.  The clip should be mounted toward the top-most part of the back, with at least four rivets securing the clip pad to the case.

The carabiner loop:  Already coming unstitched on one side (literally after one day's worth of use).  Also, the loop is just large enough to accommodate a small carabiner; a little more slack would have allowed use of a full-size carabiner or other metal loop fitting (snap or D-loops, etc).  Lastly, the fabric loop should have been overlapped and extended the full length of the clip pad to ensure it stayed secured.

The carabiner:  Not a big fan of the little ""key-ring"" aluminum carabiners.  I much prefer steel (carried one for years on my keychain).

Other:  The nylon fabric used in construction is not sufficiently overlapped and double-stitched to ensure a long service life.

Overall:  I was hoping for a heavyweight piece of long-lasting work gear.  Instead, we have a lightweight piece of danger boy fluff, suited to half-hour urban jaunts to Starbucks.  This case is not something in which I'd place much trust for protecting a $300+ phone.

Too bad, since the ideas behind the case are excellent.  Not recommended.",297,5

In fact, I like it so much I bought two more as ""spares"". However, it has one critical flaw (why I can't give it 5 stars).

The belt clip is secured through a sewn-on leather pad with two 3/16""-head rivets. The heads are not big enough to hold well in the leather. I got out of the car this evening, the case caught on the seatbelt and Pop! (that's why I always add a ""bungee"").

I can repair this. Many people can't. I'll be contacting the manufacturer to tell them what happened.

So, an excellent case overall but if you plan to wear it on your belt, buyer beware!",140,8

If you put the items described above into it, it will flop around until one of 2 things happen - the belt clip breaks or the belt clip rips from the rear material of the pouch.

It's too low on the case which makes the case stick out when you wear it.  Although I haven't broke the belt clip yet, I've snagged it several times.  It's just a matter of time before I break the belt clip.  I think I would have liked this much better if they had just sewed in a belt-loop about an inch higher on the case.  That alone would have turned my 2 stars into 5 stars.

I really like the case itself.  It looks really good and it's ideal for my needs.  My cell phone, ear-buds, thumb-drives, and ink pen fit perfectly.  For this reason I gave it 2 stars (instead of -2 stars!).

Also it only goes on the right ear, but otherwise very happy with it. Also love the egg shaped charger and how it slides in and clicks in making the ear piece hard to lose.",95,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,"So, here's what I think are the basics that one wants in a Bluetooth headset: A) ease of connection B) comfortable fit in the ear C) clarity at a reasonably low level (you do NOT want to have to raise the volume of ANYTHING that's right on your ear D) ease of ""hands-free"" operation E) fairly wide range of motion away from the ""base"" phone allowing for walking while talking. On all these points the Jabra STONE2 scores extremely high. Add to that the rechargeable recharging unit (it's about the size of a small... er... stone, weighs virtually nothing and recharges the Bluetooth quickly and easily) and you've got one outstanding piece of equipment. Highly recommended! (Note: the specs say that you can get up to 4 Bluetooth recharges out of one recharge to the unit. I've only tried two, but they worked more than well enough to make me confident of the other two... and beyond. Note 2: I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, because we all know there's gonna be a STONE3 and we have to have someplace to go when rating that one.)",188,1

Even at home people complain about a lot of background noise. Outside it is impossible to make a phone call, as the device does not cancel any background noise. Traffic can be heard louder than my voice -> Impossible to use on a phone call and a real pain for everyone calling me.
I tried updating the firmware many times, even chose different firmware languages, hoping Jabra would increase the noise cancelling. I tried several different phones. Unfortunately till now no change on either of the Stone2 devices.

There are much better Bluetooth headsets out there for similar or less $$.
IE Motorola or Bose make excellent Headsets, unfortunately they are more flimsy and break more easy, but are so much better in sound. As I use a headset daily, it is the most important feature for me to have a clear conversation.

It fits very comfortably in my ear and the stone charger makes it easy to take with me on the go.

I can quickly pop the headset out of the charger and answer a call within about 3 rings of my phone.  I've had other headsets that take much longer to power on and connect to my phone before it's ready to use.  This is not an issue with the Stone2.

One of the most common complaints about this headset is the length of talk time.  I've had mine for about a year and I can only talk about 45 minutes before the battery dies.  I've had several support calls that have lasted longer than that and I've had to resort to holding the phone up to my head for the rest of the call.  I've read that the Jabra Stone3 allows you to talk for up to 2 hours before charging.  I think that would be sweet but other people even complain about that.  90% of the time the 45 minute talk time is not an issue and it recharges fast in the portable stone charger.

Many persons complain about that device can only be used in the right ear, but this for me is not any problem. The Bose bluetooth is equal (only can be used in a right ear) and has very good recommendations. I was considering to buy the Bose bluetooth but it is very big if you compare it with the Jabra and I was looking for something more discreet and the Jabra fulfilled my criteria. As for the sound, come on people this is a small device so it is always necessary to sacrifice something, the sound is not the best but you can listen the other person with great clarity and the other person can hear you with clarity too, for me it is not an issue, also if you want to listen music with an excellent sound I do not believe that any bluetooth is indicated for this, I recommend this bluetooth.....",229,41

I've tried re-bending it, but this eventually results in the plastic part of the earhook breaking.

The battery only lasted for 2 hours the next time. I can now only get about two hours at a time out of the ear piece. I find this to be very unacceptable for a Bluetooth headset.

The Jabra 2 connects instantly with my iPhone 4 the moment I take it out of the cradle. The voice quality is superb and the microphone is very sensitive. I have never had a complaint about not being heard well (as opposed to the Jawbone Era). The earrpiece sits gently against the auditory opening and the curved piece around the ear keeps it in place (you are not supposed to stuff it into your ear!). I can wear it for hours without any discomfort whatsoever. The volume control is nifty -- touch control -- just slide a finger up or down the side of the device. The best part is that you can answer the phone by just saying ""answer"" -- great when you hands are busy. The battery life could be better, but on the other hand you get a charger cradle that you can carry on you belt.

The ""stone"" charger appealed to me for ease of transportation, and if it worked as flawlessly as the Discovery 975, I'd have been extremely happy.  Unfortunately, it did not.  Here's what I experienced with my Sprint Palm Pre:

The ""helpful"" announcer voice was far too loud, to the point of being slightly painful.  No matter what I tried, I could not adjust this volume.  In fact, I could never get the volume control to work even during a call.  Additionally, there was an intermittent high frequency ""whine"" in my ear whenever I had the device on (whether on a call or not).

I liked the idea that the device automatically shut itself off when inserted into the ""stone"", and then automatically turned on again when re-extracted.  It seemed like this would help conserve energy.  Unfortunately, this also seems to have caused pairing issues.  After 10-15 minutes of being in the ""stone"", my phone still thought it was paired, but it wasn't.  So when I extracted the device from the stone to take a call, I could not use the device.  That kind of defeats the purpose of the device, IMHO.

Finally, when I did get the device to operate, the quality of incoming calls was noticeably poorer than what I had grown accustomed to with the Discovery 975.

I don't know if these issues are typical of the device or if I just got a dud.  Either way, I'm returning this item and getting another Discovery 975 for myself.",272,99

This seemed to fit the bill.
A lot of people complain about the volume controls.  They never bothered me, and in fact, I kinda liked them.  The device was super easy to use and really had no problems with its use.

Where I do have a problem is with its fit.  If you are any kind of ""bigger person"" (I'm a little over 6ft), it simply might not fit around your ear in a way that will keep the ear-bud section of it where it's supposed to be (prompting it to fall out).  I ended up bending the top of the loop a bit in hopes that I could somehow get it to stay put, no luck there.  My next thought was to heat up that portion of the ear piece in hopes of stretching it so it would fit, also not do-able as the battery is very close to that area of the device.  Eventually it became so bent up that it no longer stayed nicely in the charging doc.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,"I recently received a Jabra ""Journey"" visor mounted Blue Tooth as a gift. It is a most excellent product despite its reasonable pricing. However, I also bought a Jabra ""Stone 2"" wireless Blue Tooth earpiece. Over many years, I have owned a number of Blue tooth earpieces and none have equaled the sound clarity, ease of operation and quality workmanship of this Jabra product. However, unfortunately, it did not fit my ear canal properly with any of the different sized earbuds that came with this blue tooth and I am hoping that Jabra will allow me to return this product for credit. Were it not for the ill fitting earbud (my goofy shaped ear canals, perhaps?), I would not consider returning this most excellent product.

Thank you Jabra, many manufactures could learn much from your keen manufacturing abilities and fair pricing.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,1.0,negative,"This bluetooth is not for everyone.  There is NO adjustment to fit different sized ears.  If it by chance fits your ear, the stars have lined up for you and you should probably buy a lottery ticket too.  I can't give a fair evaluation on the sound quality of this item because it is completely useless if you can't keep it in your ear to begin with.  The belt-clip on the charger broke the first week I tried to use it.  Very cheap.  I was a foolish consumer as I thought the fixed earpiece would be adjustable, but it simply isn't.  My bad!  There is no notice in their information that it is not adjustable, so beware, if you ear isn't the right size, this one is a waste of your money.",132,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,5.0,positive,"I have tried many bluetooth devices - and have hated them all because of the amount of pressure they would put on my ear. The ones I tried didn't have an around the ear thing to keep the device in place (or it wouldn't be very helpful), so only the earbud would be holding the device. The Jabra 2, on the other hand, not only has the around the ear thing, but is extremely comfortable and stylish. The sound quality is amazing and I often forget it's there (so comfortable). I am really happy with this purchase!",97,115

You only get about an hour and maybe another thirty minutes before the thing goes dead, and thats on a full charge from the wall charger. And usually I leave my electronics charging all night, so they'll be ready to go by morning when I leave for work. Sound quality leaves much to be desired, and god help you if your in a noisy environment, I don't know what so-called noise canceling tech they're using, but it it sucks you may be able to hear people when you in increase the volume but the sure won't hear a thing you say. Honestly I don't think the device has any noise canceling abilities at all.

Cons: Everything else.",143,116

-Light
-Comfortable
-Music
-Rechargeable on the go with out putting on an outlet

CONS -
-Not so great when on the move because calls break up and the mic pics up vehicle noise
-when connected to multiple devices it doesn't switch back very well. Some times needs to be repaired.
-When battery level is moderate it needs charge very soon.

Overall a great ear piece for someone who gets a large volume of calls all day long. I recharge it at lunch sometimes because it was dead don't always have to though.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,2.0,negative,"I ordered two of these at the same time.  We liked the compact, light weight size and the fact that it had the little egg-shaped charger that you can just pop it into to recharge.  Too, it was kind of a cool design/style.  All of which proved to be pretty much right on.  Unfortunately, when it comes to performing it's primary role as a headset for our cell phones, it falls short... FAR short.  Why?

-  Its featherweight but fits awkwardly and always feels like it's going to fall out of your ear (and often does).  It also is next to impossible to put on sunglasses (or glasses, I presume) and wear this headset.  I had a plantronics voyager previously which was far more comfortable and didn't prove to be nearly as much of an issue with sunglasses.

-  It can only be worn in one ear.  It doesn't flip or anything to wear in the other ear.  We knew that in advance and didn't think it would be an issue... turns out that it proved to be more annoying for both of us than we'd expected.

-  The voice prompts and connectivity were easy... the call quality however was just average.

-  The egg charger was cool... and convenient.  However, it comes with something like a 12 inch cord (if that long)... ridiculous... who has an outlet 12 inches from the surface of their desk or nightstand etc.

-  Within 6 months, one is basically dead... it will hold a charge for maybe 2 or 3 minutes max.  The other is doing slightly better but lasts only 20-30 minutes.

I'll go back to my plantronics... it lasted, had better call quality and was more comfortable... unfortunately, no convenient charger but I'll deal with that anyday vs. these issues.",299,119

Otherwise, it was easy to link up with my phone (there's a tutorial for this that comes on the first time you turn it on), and it got good sound. Changing the volume level was a little tricky, though, and the battery life may be too short for some. Would've been a pretty good product if it hadn't been defective.",78,120

It was relatively simple to pair - I've got it linked to my laptop and cell phone. I love that it has a little charging dock.

I don't typically talk very long on the phone, but when I do, I'm delighted to have this little stone. I think the battery was near exhausted on one phone call. I've yet to deplete both the headset, and its charger.

At least I know how to answer, and connect. I get the feeling this little thing can do more than what I ask of it, but I just haven't bothered/needed to figure that out.

I mainly bought it to use the device hands free, ie being able to control it by voice. Unfortunately the device does not understand the way I say ""answer"" hence I have to either use my hand to press the answer button on the device, or more irritatingly ask a colleague or staff to press it for me when I am wearing sterile gloves ( I am a surgeon).
Secondly unless you are connected to the Internet it does not take dictation such as for replying to sms's. Overall the device is ok as long as you want to use it as a blue tooth device, but for voice commands it's pretty useless. Battery life is good, using the portable charger I can use it for 5-6 days without recharging.  The belt clip for the charger is made of plastic and breaks within a week.

After fully charging the headset, I used it during a 2 hour conference call.  The call quality was so-so.  I wasn't very impressed and the other participants said that it was just ok.  The claims about suppressing background noise seem inflated as the other participants commented twice about the background noise.  After 89 minutes, the device indicated that the battery was low.  At 96 minutes the device shut down.  Everything you read on Amazon and the other sites about the battery life is true.  Stay away from this one and go with the Plantronics Voyager+.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,"As my review title essentially explains, the Jabra STONE2 Bluetooth headset is a simple Bluetooth earpiece for your phone that gets the job done. Unfortunately, it's a little expensive compared to the competition and the microphone isn't the best.

For starters, the Jabra STONE2 isn't the smallest Bluetooth headset on the market. In fact, it feels pretty big on your ear. That said, the STONE2 is pretty comfortable to wear. The Bluetooth connection is easy to setup and the headset stays connected to my work BlackBerry quite well. The battery life is fantastic (a positive side effect of the size of the headset) and you get a pre-programmed voice alert when the battery is low.

Audio reception was a bit of a mixed blessing with the STONE2. I had no trouble hearing people when they were on the phone with me and the audio quality is pretty good for a single-ear headset, but the microphone wasn't always the best for people trying to hear me during calls. Most people told me that they didn't realize I was using a headset (no background noise) but they oft asked me to ""speak up"" when talking. I suspect the headset blocks ambient noise but also weakens the voice of the speaker when it's blocking background noise from the call.

The biggest complaint I have about the STONE2, however, is the price. I've seen this headset listed from less than $100 to well over $100. As someone who has several Bluetooth headsets, I'd say the STONE2 competes with other Bluetooth headsets priced around $75. I certainly won't pay more than $100 for a headset like this when there are cheaper ones that are every bit as good.",283,155

If you talk for several hours each day, and leave it on standby for the entire day, the battery life may not work for you.  However, if you're like me and only talk for 20-30 mins each day and only need 1/2 day standby, it works fine because you can store it in the recharger stone (which turns it off) for awhile and completely recharge it in an hour or so.  Then when you need it, its easily removed from the stone and ready to talk inside of 5 seconds or so.  I've found it's had no ""re"" pairing problems either. The only negative is occasional mediocre voice quality, but at least volume is good.  Pairs well with my Macs as well.

For my usage pattern and cell equipment, it works quite well and is highly recommended.",193,156

Overall, the only reason I gave this headset three stars is because it is quite comfortable to wear.  I need a hands-free device for my occupation and this one is comfortable enough to wear all day.  If it wasn't comfy, I'd send it back.",114,157
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,1.0,negative,I bought this and found out that the battery life is only 2 hrs. you need to keep charging it with the base unit to get ten hours.  All the reviews and specs on Amazon site is misleading.  There are times the unit will not charge properly if you placed it back to the base unit when the base unit is plugged into a usb port. you need to unplug from usb port and plug in again to ensure the unit will charge properly.  This is not in the manual,90,158

I used the product the next day while at work and the battery died after just 5 hours.  I put it into the charging pod like it said to do and it charged it up seemingly like it advertised.  The battery only lasted for 2 hours the next time.  I can now only get about two hours at a time out of the ear piece.  I find this to be very unacceptible for a bluetooth headset.  Especially when it was adverdised that you should get 10 hours of talk time.  Everything else about this is good.  The design is very comfortable and the voice activation feature works well when it actually has a charge.  The battery life is the only drawback to this product.

I waited about a minute, and tried again - and it found my phone immediately and hookedup beautifully.  The sound quality is excellent, and the design is elegant and comfortable on the ear. The charger is nicely designed though it was a bit odd to figure out how to pop the headset out of it - you have to push from UNDER it. A truly minor concern if at all.  The Jabra holds a charge well and I love the caller ID - it tells you who's calling (if the number is in your phone.) If you're not used to a headset it could be startling. I haven't tried all the features of it, because I really don't need some of them, but I am very pleased with what I've experienced and recommend it.",149,170
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,2.0,negative,"The first headset I received was a bust. It worked for about the first 20 minutes. The voice activated answer feature stopped working shortly after I started using it. Not too long afterwords, the headset would not pair with any device. It was sent back and the replacement arrived in a couple of days. So far the headset is comparable to pretty much every other bluetooth device. The noise cancellation doesn't work very well. The headset can be charged in the stone several times giving the headset up to 10 hours of talk time, but carrying the ""stone"" around can be rather annoying. The speaker in the headset makes the person you are speaking to sound muffled. A lot of background noise makes the headset useless because the noise cancellation doesn't work very well. The features and function do not justify the price of the device. On a positive note, the headset looks really good. Try something cheaper if you are okay with average performance and features.",167,171
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,2.0,negative,"To be fair in this review I have to say that my expectations were very high based on the price of the headset and I was very disappointed.  I was amazed at the ease of how it paired with my phone, I had barely taken it out of the package before it did so, and it fits comfortably over the ear.

However, after that initial impression things started to go downhill.  I made the mistake of not bringing the ""egg"" with me when I first started using it and ended up pocket dialing people constantly (something that never happened with my other headsets when I put them into my pocket instead of always wearing them).  The talk time was also very limited as compared to the other headsets that I have had (lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes before it died).  The included charger has a cord that is only about a foot long which means you can't use any kind of wall outlet unless you can stack something right next to it and is very limited in power so it takes an extremely long time to recharge the unit using it.  I have found that the sound of my unit tends to come in and out (again, something that doesn't happen with other headsets I have used) and the earbud tends to pull away from my ear.  The barely existent documentation doesn't even tell you how to control the volume on the headset (you do so by sliding your finger along the unit instead of pushing a button).

There are lots of ""cool"" features related to your smart phones, especially the I-phone, but unless you must have these features, you are much better off buying a standard headset than this overpriced one.",294,172
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,"Works great once you get the right rubberized ear piece fitted to the headset.  I had a lot of trial and error to get the right comfort and volume to hear.  If your phone supports it, works through voice activation and announces through the ear piece for incoming call.  The charging station has a very short power cord making it almost impractical to keep the charger on your desk plugged in a power source unless you have a socket directly on your desk or within the cubical. Hard to get the volume set correctly. All and all however, a huge improvement over my last Jabra headset.",106,173

I wasn't too thrilled that adjusting the volume of the headset wasn't as straightforward as I'd like.  On multiple attempts to adjust the volume I ended up shutting off the headset or ending my call.  In this area, this headset doesn't even come close to the ease of use found in the Motorola Oasis set.

While I can hear very clearly with this headset, those who I was taking to heard an echo on their end while I was using this headset.  That may be something to consider if you're thinking about buying this headset.",134,175

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,2.0,negative,"Love the one piece design, no funky or fancy movable ear hanger. Previous bluetooths I have purchased have overly thought out earhooks that would flop out, loosen, or fall off with the slightest head movement because the hinge was too loose. I even had one wear the hook stayed in my ear and hours later I discovered the bluetooth was gone. So I got this one, looked and sounded superb. First one came with a ripped eargel (The style I had wanted to use), and two hours after removing from charger it would constantly voice in my ear ""Low Battery"". Customer support was nice enough and prompt to send a replacement providing you email copy of reciept. A couple shipping later I got the proper replacement.

Sadly though, I don't think the first one was much more defective that the replacement, now 3 hours later I get the constant notification of ""low battery"" after only calling once. It can do this for hours and forces you to carry the conveniant chargin ""Stone"". What makes it worse is it will contantly interrupt a call with this and cut off both sides. Terrible when exchanging important info, is aggravating, and let's not forget having to constantly repeat portions of a conversation.

In all, I would only recommend this for an occasional user, a commuter perhaps, not someone that needs to wear it through their workday. Looks like I need to look for bluetooth number 5.",243,178

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,4.0,positive,"The Jabra Stone2 Bluetooth headset has a wonderfully engineered design.  The small headset fits seamlessly inside its ""stone"" for charging.  When charging, not only does it look cute in the little stone, but it is well protected as well.  The headset itself fits well on the users ear, and worked well with my Droid 2.  So far, during use, I have only had two instances of bad reception.  One instance had to be corrected by ending the connection and calling the caller back and the other corrected itself as I moved the phone in closer proximity to the headset while I was talking on it.

After the initial charge, the tiny headset holds a charge for a very long time (I have not had to recharge it in over a week).

The headset is small enough, and light enough not to become uncomfortable after extended wear, and its sleek design is not intrusive.

The only other problem I had with the headset is when adjusting it in my ear, I almost always turn it off accidentally by touching the small silver button on the end, but I think that's just me.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,2.0,negative,"I've been on the hunt for the perfect bluetooth headset....and this one came the closest so far.

I have an iPhone 4....I know...I know... everyone says it's the phone's fault..... but not this time.

The Stone 2 had just about everything I needed, ESPECIALLY clear call quality on the receiver's end and the longest range (far from the phone) that I've tested.

However, two things that are TERRIBLE and UNACCEPTABLE w/this headset:

1. battery life stinks. You have HAVE to keep it constantly in it's stone base charger in order for it to last through your next 30-60 min call.  My average battery life on a single charge was 45 mins.

2. A2DP ***KILLS*** this headset on the iPhone. Now, before you berate Apple for not having A2DP settings.... other headsets like the Plantronics Pro+ and ALL of the Jawbones DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM: When the headset is powered ""on"" and connected to the phone each and EVERY sound the phone makes goes thru the headset. Yeah, every text message, push notification alert, calendar alert, etc goes thru the headset. I like to have my headset ready to go when a call comes in...SO, unless you are wearing the headset ALL DAY LONG you will not hear any sounds the phone makes.

I called Jabra customer service and they insisted it was a setting on the iPhone. I emailed them with my same inquiry, 5 biz days ago. Their automated response said they would get back to me in 48 hours. They have not.

Installation was seamless with respect to connectivity thanks to the enclosed ""getting started"" leaflet with simplified illustrations and to-the-point directions on basic usage.  The charging station is very nice and protective, and gives you an immediate reading on your power level.  I have yet to use it to see if 2 hour charge is accurate.

One thing that I am slightly dissatisfied with is the lack of customization for the fitting of the headset.  The extra eargels are nice to offer however, the actual headset needs to be more adjustable to achive maximum comfort.",128,186
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,5.0,positive,"It took me about 15 seconds to get this bluetooth headset up and working.

If you are not technologically inclined, there may not be a more user-friendly product on the market.

The sound quality was good.  I did not test this in the open air so I don't know how wind affects the sound, but in an enclosed area the sound is excellent.

I also love its charger (you have more than one option in that regard), which can double as a storage case.  All in all, this is an outstanding unit.  I can definitely recommend it.",130,187

I like how it announces who is calling, what the battery strength is and the compactness of the headset.  I did think the charging cords were ridiculously short.  I was amazed about that, but then again, once you have the base charged, it really isn't a big deal.  I did have a comment that I did sound a bit tinny, but understandable.  I have an iPhone and it connected up quickly and easily and I am able to listen to music (granted, one ear) but it worked flawlessly.  It would be nice if it was a little less expensive, but I am glad I bought it.  No manual (to speak of), but just go on-line and there is all the info you need.",144,188
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,5.0,positive,"After tinkering around a bit with the headset and its accessories, one thought that came to my mind was, ""If it were to design Bluetooth headsets, this is how Apple would do it.""

It has a very sleek look, feels strong in your hand and fingers, the battery and status indicators are sleek. When you slide and place the headset into its portable charger, it fits very snugly into the charger, and the status LEDs light up immediately for a few  seconds. Furthermore, after you place the headset in its portable charger, you get two options for re-charging it: you can either plug the charger into the USB port of your computer, or you can plug it into an AC outlet. Cables are provided for both charging options. This is useful, as it allows you to choose to carry only the USB charging cord with you when mobile (along with the portable charger), while keeping the AC adapter at office or at home.

The packaging is a bit puzzling to figure out. It's easy enough to open the package, but to extricate the headset and the charger requires you to fiddle a bit with the cover. Wish it had been easier to open the package.

Sound quality is so far good enough. Longevity and reliability will take more time to assess.",221,189

Anyway, the main disadvantage (once you get it out of the horrible packaging) is that the battery is small (the headset is small and light) so that limits the useful lifetime of the headset. I think this is another of those either/or issues, if you use it only for occasional calls during the day, this is probably enough, but if you live on the phone, you will run out of juice during the day. I think the practical talk time is a couple of hours before recharging. It pairs nicely with the iPhone.",124,190
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004KPLA9Q,2.0,negative,"There's a lot of flaws with this bluetooth that other, cheaper devices don't have. There's a lot of good things, too, but the bad ones are pretty bad.

First the good: It's got good reception, and when you first turn it on, you get clear instructions from the bluetooth as to how to pair it with your phone. That's pretty neat! I also like the charging base that it uses, and the fact that it activates as soon as you disconnect it from the base. No need to turn it on! Of course, on the other hand that means there's no way to turn it off. Also, when I was on it, I could hear the caller clearly and they could hear me, but the other bluetooth I use cost less than a quarter what this one does and does the same thing.

Now for the bad. First, it's only able to be used with the right ear. I tend to wear my bluetooth devices on my left ear, especially when I'm riding my bike. That's a pretty major problem right there, and that would be enough to stop me from buying it. Also, the battery life is a joke. They say it lasts ten hours? On a full charge mine managed a bit more than two hours. Further, the shape of this thing is a bit odd, and if you reach up to adjust it, it's even money that you might disconnect with the call you're on. This is really inconvenient.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,3.0,neutral,They seem to work well and are functional. however the end pieces sometimes come off. I think they were designed that way so you can change out the ear pieces if need be but sometimes wen i'm running they'll just come off. other then that no issues especially when im just lounging around listening to music. ps the piece pops right back on no worries.,65,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,5.0,positive,"I don't even want to give these ear buds the credit they deserve cause im afraid that they will all sell out or the company will raise the price!
Been using expensive and cheap ear buds for many years, and trust me, without a doubt, these are the absolute BEST QUALITY SOUND, AWESOME INLINE SPEAKER AND NEXT PAUSE OR NEXT SONG BUTTON right on the speaker!

Wow!  Awesome buy, for an awesome price!  I initially bought 4, just cause they were so cheap, i was just going to throw them away if they didn't work.
But all 4 work as well as iphone earbuds ($40.00) and are MORE COMFORTABLE with the included soft ear insert!!

Awesome buy!
Thank you",119,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,3.0,neutral,"I like the metal used.. however sometimes the buds will cause the speaker phone function to activate intermittently which sometimes causes lapse in audio

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,3.0,neutral,"The microphone in my smartphone was on the fritz so I bought these headphones primarily for the built in mic.  They worked very well for the purpose - people said I sounded fine through the mic.  For phone calls or listening to talk radio the in-ears produce strong, clear sound.  For music, they aren't good even compared to other very cheap in-ear headphones.  But for my purposes they worked well, and were very comfortable.  Unfortunately, after two months of use, the sound keeps cutting out of the left earpiece - started as once in a  while, then constantly within a day or so.  If you jiggle the wire, you can get it back but only for a few seconds.  I know these are real cheap and I don't expect great build quality, but I think they should last longer than two months.  I would have given them 4-5 stars for how they worked but breaking after two months makes me give them a combined 3 stars.",166,30

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,1.0,negative,I bought these headphones and thought they would be good they worked for about a week and then I noticed that my ears kept stinging and I thought maybe it was because it had ear wax on it but I cleaned them and everything and continued using them and then I noticed that they were shocking my ears I couldn't wear them at all because they shocked me even had my husband try using them thinking it was just me but they were shocking him just as well...my advice is not to use them unless you like getting the inside of your ears shocked...,104,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,1.0,negative,I bought these to go to Texas. And me being who I am I thought they would be great and cheap so I bought them. On my way to Texas the first day I had them the left ear bud broke and no sound came out of it. The Mic didn't even work an they were brand new! The next thing I know I accidently dropped my phone and the head phones get cot onto something. So I untangled it and the peice where the mic is at comes off. So then the whole headphones didn't work at all >.< But like they say 1 in 4 headphones are always defectied. It might not be the same for you  but I wouldn't take the chances.,125,34

My expectations were low initially because of the price and what a review or two stated. I listen to a plethora of music, videos, and games (mainly music ranging from classical to hip-hop) and these are a great buy.

A caveat I have for those serious about this purchase, I had one of the pieces fall out of the actual earbud itself, but it didn't hinder nor damage the actual wiring or sound at all. I super-glued the part that actually goes into the ear (rubber piece and some plastic casing) back to the base of the earbud and I'm still using them everyday even as I type this review.

TL;DR  Great headphones for cheap, fell apart slightly (maybe my own fault) but no damaged was caused.",141,73

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,1.0,negative,"First of all, these earbuds were costly to ship and didn't come fast AT ALL. Then, when they finally came, I plugged them into my Ipod to test them. They kept popping out of my ears and then I noticed only one of the buds worked, The left bud had NO sound coming out of it. The Mic didn't work at all and had no effect on the Ipod whatsoever. Terrible, waste of money.",74,78
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,2.0,negative,I used this to my iphone 4s and all of the people I talked to using this headset complained that they hear an annoying and ear-piercing 'hissing' sound. so I dumped this headset and bought another headset for my iphone.,40,79
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,1.0,negative,these were so crappy one side bigger than the outher what the hells up with that then when you try to put both sides in the wire just looks strange don't buy it,33,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK6OOO,5.0,positive,These earphones were way better than I expected especially for the low price. The audio quality is very clear and the bass is picked up very well even on songs with alot of it and at high volumes. The only con was that the left earbud wire is shorter than the other side most likely because of the mic that is below it. Other than that these In-ear Bud headphones deserve 5 out of 5 stars and I will definitely get another pair in the future.,86,81

The first didn't work well after a few days using it with an iPhone.  Still functions as earpiece for music and such, but the mic was unusable.  The second has been working for the last month without flaw, as good as any other more expensive headphones.  One great thing is that the rubber ear pieces stay on the headphones which is excellent!!!  Having lost many other rubber ear pieces on other headsets this was an unexpected pleasure.  Great price and functionality, but order a few of them just in case.",107,83

The black rubbery part that goes into your ear is kind of flapping around, it's not solid behind it, which means it's more comfy for different size ear holes, but also means it will be easy to tear.

Considering they only cost $1.50, I didn't expect much and wouldn't have cared if they didn't work at all but to my surprise they do a decent job.  I can hear clearly and the people I've called so far said they could hear me just fine (just as well as any other time they've spoken to me while I was wearing a hands free headset).  I just received them yesterday so I can't speak to their durability or how well they're made but for the price, I'm pretty happy.  I'm going to order a bunch to keep around in case they don't last long or get lost.  So far, I'd say this is a good buy.",168,1

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,"These headphones have an excellent price. Because of that you can't expect a killer pair of headphones. But for someone like me who is always losing things they are perfect. The sound quality is not stellar, and gets worse as the volume increases, but it is better than I predicted for such an affordable product. Overall my opinion is that you are getting what you pay for when you buy this product - an affordable, working pair of headphones with a working microphone.",83,33

However I buy the cheap ones because of my electric wheelchair. Once under a wheel & get the super glue. That is IF the wire isn't broken & if u find all the pieces. Oh, they also short out. One set I had a couple weeks when it started turning the volume down on my phone! Hahaha Ever heard of anything like that? Seriously, soon as it's plugged in u can watch the volume pop up and shoot right to mute! So now I'm using the stiff one that's been super glued, till the new one arrives. LoL",125,35

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,Sound quality is good and they are comfortable in the ears.  The only improvement would be the length of the wire from the ear bud to the microphone.  One side is longer than the other.  Overall they are a good value for the money.,44,59

It takes several weeks to get to the US. I live on the west coast, but even then it took 3 or so weeks to arrive, as its shipped from China. I would not buy these again.

Everything outside the bass range comes through very clearly and the sound is not at all tinny. The color is exactly as pictured. These hang off the left side rather than being centered, so the cord to the right earbud is significantly longer than the left.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,2.0,negative,not worth the money. they both broke in about the period of time (less than a month). save your time and money. eForCity products sucks I bough other products from the same company and they broke in less than a month.,41,77

I assumed you could pull on the wires to make the right and left earbuds wires lengths the same distance from the mic cylinder (they are not even), and I ended up pulling the mic electronics right out of the mic cylinder with very little force on the wires. There should be instructions with the product that tells you that you can not adjust the earbuds wire lengths (i.e., distance to the mic cylinder). The left earbud wire length is like twice the right earbud wire length, and the lengths are not adjustable. I never even got to use the product.

UPDATE: Just bought $9.99 Spoke SkullCandy 2XL silicone earbuds at OfficeMax store in person, they work great, fit great, are worth the price, have ambient chatter reduction, and comes with two different pairs of silicone gel earbud sizes (one large set, one small set).",156,223

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,1.0,negative,"I ordered two sets of these buds to keep in the car and for emergencies... Right after using one pair it stopped working immediately on one side.

The ear buds comes only in one size, which is a bit small for me, and they are also metal and I would personally say they are really heavy. Also the mic side has less cord than the non mic side, making the weight distribution uneven. Because they are so heavy, if one side falls out the other bud gets ripped out of your ear at full speed, then you are left scrambling saying ""wait, what?! as you shove these back in your ears.

They also make a buzzing sound if you volume is too high. Overall cheap, heavy buds and may not work. Shop another product.",134,225

Love them!!!,61,232

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,"So one thing I really enjoyed about the seller of this item, is the item was shipped out the next day, and arrived at the exact start date as the  estimated delivery. The ear buds were very useful when enjoying music at higher and lower volumes. Some minor flaws I found with the design of the product was that the ear buds at first were uncomfortable. They sunk deeply into my ear canal. But, after an hour or two, this no longer became an issue. This in return made the ear buds have a firm grip to my ears that secured them in place so they did not fall out. The mic was hard to connect to my windows operating system and was not recognized. But I do have a feeling that it was only an issue with my computer, but the design and placement of the mic control was not helpful either. Over all a quality product and worth the money definitely. The look of the headphones are very professional and have a sexy design. I'd recommend using the ear buds as headphones instead of a microphone. Overall great quality product.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004SK71C8,4.0,positive,"I originally got these so I could watch movies on my Nook Color, as its external sound is pretty low.  I was pleasantly surprised, especially considering the price, at how well they work.  Actually, I hadn't even realized there was a microphone included.

One minor complaint is that I am unable to tell if the microphone is on or off without testing it.  I have only used it for a skype call.

The headphones worked perfectly on my Nook Color, UX31E Zenbook, and 1000HE netbook.
For some reason, on my main tower, the microphone didn't work and the headphones would give me sound in one ear.  (Although, if plugged into speakers connected to the tower, it was fine.)

Apparently, it's only partially the tower's issue, as other headphones, plugged into the tower's headphone jack, gave sound in both ears.  This is a minor issue for me, as I don't often need headphones with the tower.

With every other device I tried, however, the headphones and microphone were fine, surprisingly good for a two dollar accessory.  Quality wasn't tremendous, but for the price, I think it merits 4 stars, and would think so, even if it were ten dollars more.",199,239

But no! It's not junk at all. The sound quality is really decent and the mic sounds clear to anyone I chatting with.
My only suggestion to any user would be that they should use only the left ear when driving because these ear buds are nice and snug. Having one in each ear really does block out the sound of the outside world which is not cool while driving.
I have used the mic and buds in a fairly loud environment and I was able to hear the person on the other end talking to me. in a situation like that, two buds is a great idea.
Music: The sound is flat and clean but not bass heavy. It's not what I would use to listen to music normally but I was listening to a pod cast while waiting for a call to come in and the sound was fine for my professional ears.
Nice value.

My son is one of those people with smaller ears, so I ended up having to swap the tips out with an extra set I had laying around that came with another brand.

Tangles just like any other set of ear buds if you toss them around carelessly.

Might just be my ear but it falls out easily. If I'm careful it stays in but if you have long hair tie it back so it doesn't catch onto the wire. When you go to move around it might fall out.

This cover has a nice, refreshing design, and is definitely made to stay on-the first time I tried taking it off to switch covers, it took quite awhile, but I suppose that's a good thing if it stays on when dropped. It has a nice, smooth, hard plastic outer shell. However, last week, some of the design started to chip off, even though the cover hadn't faced much wear and tear. An otherwise nice cover, but with a cheap paint job. I'm still keeping it on my phone because it provides a reasonable amount of protection, and the price is a lot better than spending $30 at the mall.",127,29

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,Doesn't offer much in the way of protection. I thought it was going to be textured but it's just flat. All around a big ol' meh. I like the 99 cent silicon cassette tape cover better.,36,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,"The design is printed into the plastic, so there's nothing that should wear or peel off over time.  I don't particularly like this style of case, it barely covers the phone, has no lip that comes around the front of the screen to protect the phone when setting it face-down on surfaces.  It's made of that plastic that has a slightly soft or velvet feel to it even though it isn't coated with anything, it's nice, just a little more grippy.

The design is really adorable, I love that it says 01134! So cute.

If you are looking for a really minimal hard snap-on case and you like the design, you would like this case, it's just not what I was looking for.  I thought maybe the buttons would be shaped in the plastic more, or maybe feel like rubbery calculator buttons, but the design is simply in the flat plastic. It's still high-quality and very cute, though.",158,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,Definitely not what the pictures shows.

To cheap to resale so I will be giving this away.,52,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,1.0,negative,The snap cover does not stand proud of the front glass. It's fit does not feel secure. It's glossy so offers no more grip than the glass. The phone can slide up and down about 1mm which is disconcerting when you go to press the lock button on top. The graphic looks cool though but I think I will return to a better snap case that has some texture and covers the front edges. It's a shame it was not made better. I have a lot of other Fred products that I like a lot.,95,18

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,for the price you can't really complain.  as a photographer its a great signature fo rmyself and people love it.  the black paint wears easily on the edges and itsnt built for a long life.  isn't really bulit for more then just looks . however it was fun to have.,50,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,I purchased this case in the calculator design. It is cute and a bit of a conversation starter! After a month or so one of the sides broke off.

I'll just say that if you're looking for an iPhone case that protects the front of the screen then this is NOT the case for you.

I have made it a point to secure this iPhone baby at all times to ensure the glass doesn't crack.",88,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,I find this to produce a nice retro camera look. The graphics are high quality and durable on the phone. I get compliments on it. I have a 4S and the room for the buttons is fine.,37,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,I saw the other reviews and thought I was being very careful to protect my case but within a couple of weeks it was very scuffed and dirty.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,Love this product. It fits perfectly and the graphics are beautiful. It is very nostalgic for me but none of my much younger coworkers have any idea what a transistor radio is.,32,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,"all aspects of order handling and delivery good, but product has one minor flaw, in my opinion.  It doesn't quite come all the way to the front of the phone.  The mark of a good slimline case, to me, is an almost imperceptible lip over the front so that the phone can be placed face down without the screen coming in to contact with whatever surface it is placed on.",70,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,3.0,neutral,"I purchased this for my iPhone 4s and it fits perfectly, no hassles what-so-ever. I can access ALL buttons and use the USB charger with the case on.

I'm not for sure if the case is made well. Sure it feels strong but is it strong enough? I guess I'll find out when I eventually drop my phone.

Anyhow, my only real complaint is the camera sticker/cover is not sharp and rich in detail. It's not pixelated but simply looks blurred or the cover used came from a scanned image. Kinda upsetting but I have no intentions on sending the product back or buying an alternative case/cover

Also, my phone did not arrive in the package as pictured above, it was opened and bubble wrapped.",125,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,5.0,positive,"This is  a hard plastic cover that fits snugly but allows room for the function buttons. I had a transistor radio when I was a kid, so I love the way the case looks. Very clever product. Shipped quickly and was reasonably priced.",43,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,"I was under the impression that this was more than just a photo reproduction on a flat glassy surface. That aside, the design is upside down. If you want to use the volume button (+) to take photos (holding the phone horizontally) the design on the case is upside down from how you're holding the camera (iphone). It should be right side up in alignment with how you would click a camera button. The photo of the man in the picture is a misrepresentation of the product I received.",89,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,2.0,negative,"The case is very cute, which is why I bought it in the first place.
The back has a non slip surface, which I also liked.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XTKGSA,4.0,positive,"I like this cover, works perfect for my iphone 4s.  The only draw back is I thought it was matte but its actually super shiney and gets finger prints on it very easily.  I'll probly end up gifting it.",39,34

You may be able to find a better iPhone tripod stand that costs more, but if you're looking to save money, this is a great choice!",73,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,1.0,negative,I purchased to use with IPOD Touch. Right out of the package the tripod was flimsy. The holder can't even hold the weight of the IPOD. I don't recommend this product at all. As a matter of fact I have been looking for an inexpensive quality tripod and have yet to find one. I've purchase at least three and have essentially wasted my money and time. I am now looking to find a quality product for a bit more money to get the job done.,85,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,"Everyone seems to think they have to buy name brand gadget accessories when the force of attraction between wallet, iPod / iPhone, and compatible devices starts to rear its proverbial ugly head. Usually your pockets become lighter and you have nothing to show over some generic product that can be sourced at a ridiculously lower cost.

Enter the Mini Tripod Stand + Holder. This thing does what it says. It stands your i-Device on three legs and allows you a few axes of adustment. It's a simple design so its patent has probably run out in the Kodak days, allowing for various injection molding shops west of Hawaii to extend their reach past button making.

So what does all this mean for us Amazon shoppers? A great product at a great price that's been functional and reliable in relatively modern use for the last year - in my case. Certainly I'd give this as a stocking stuffer or an office gift if I saw someone scratching their phone across their desk daily listening to Pandora. Or maybe it would make a great gift for that person who uses their phone more as a camera than anything else. Regardless, this is a good product at a good value that's not hard to make and probably pretty difficult to screw up. So go ahead, take the leap, break free from the affection you have towards aftermarket distributors who try to build a brand and build profit margins on your loyalty. Buy one of these no-name stands and you'll be glad you did - and you'll probably start changing your accessory-shopping habits from the experience.",272,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,The iPhone holder works reasonable well but the tripod only functions in landscape/horizontal position. In the portrait/vertical position the tripod's legs do not expand wide enough to prevent the camera from tipping over. Placing the iPhone in the holder is somewhat cumbersome as you need to pull and hold the spring loaded clamp with one hand while sliding in the iPhone with the other hand. Using a better tripod fixes the tipping problem. I suggest the company replace the tripod or sell just the holder without the tripod.,88,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,3.0,neutral,"Well I liked it till I accidentally drop it and it broke :-(

But the Tripod won't hold the weight of an I phone in a vertical position so I just used it it horizontally . Great for washing show on the phone!

The spring that holds the phone is way to strong. The portrait position doesn't even slightly work. If you try to put it in portrait position it always falls over. Lastly, the ball joint positioning is all or none. If you don't crank the screw down the phone flops down.

The downside of it is that the quality seems to be not so good (easy to find artifacts on the plastic surface and edges of the frame). The holder is a little bit too tight, barely able to hold an iPhone 5. I cant fit my Galaxy S II in.

Everyone who walked by wanted to know where I got it and how much it cost. When I told them it was less than four bucks, they ordered their own.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,"This would work well for most. I was using this in reference to a guide on how to use an android phone with a DSLR.

In short however there are limitations on the device in general although, it does as described.

There is a limit to the width on the item. Its plastic so expect it to bend a bit but it definitely still holds it in firmly.

The model phone i was trying to hold in it was the Motorola Atrix 2. Its a bit wider phone and barely fits, but it fits snug and comfortable. I would feel confidant using it in the field.

The side adjustable part of this mount has a small ratchet mechanism. Basically just manual pressure holding nothing specific. IT opens and closes when the atrix is in the mount itself since to expose the usb it has to be a little further past the end of the bottom part of the mount. Not a big deal, but it doesnt fit 100%.

Regardless of the issues its a spring hold not screw tighten mount. Cheap but does the job very well and securely. No complaints here for a cheap cell phone tripod.",198,77

However, the more I pull on the top piece, the more I feel like it's going to break, but it hasn't (yet). It's sturdy when it's landscaped, but not so much when you turn it to portrait. You actually have to adjust one of the legs for it to work in portrait mode. It automatically falls over otherwise. Besides that, it's a good accessory to have.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B004XV0UX4,4.0,positive,"Depending on your tripod/cellphone holder needs, this item could be perfect for you.  It does what you'd expect it to do.  I haven't had the item long so I can't review how long it will last, but the tripod and holder were simple enough to use right outside the box.  As some mentioned, if you don't extend the tripod legs to their full length, having the tripod hold your phone in certain positions will make it topple over.  However, extending the tripod legs cured that problem and there was no cellphone/camera positioning that caused the unit to lose it's balance.

Because of the way the product is made, adjusting the camera to certain angles is either not possible or requires a lot of manipulation.  Whether the phone is being held in an upright or sideways position, you'll find that you won't be able to tilt the unit back or sideways as much as you may need for certain pictures.  Depending on your intended usage, that may be a problem, but for me, I can work around.

I purchased two of these tripods and the other tripod/holder listed as ""Case Star Octopus Style Portable and adjustable Tripod Stand Holder for iPhone, Cellphone ,Camera and Case Star Cellphone Bag-Blue and Black"" for about $9.  My recommendation would be to spend the extra dollars because the other items gives you a lot more flexibility.  But for the cost of this item, I guess there is not much room to complain.",247,87

The spring for the holder is really tight, and just as you think you have it open wide enough, it snaps off (but doesn't break, you can insert it back in no problem). I would not recommend using this outside holding a very expensive piece of equipment, as sometimes the legs give out and can tip over or even fall.

But, for my intended use, I say it's an okay product.",108,93

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0053E9OSC,2.0,negative,"As with many people, I've done lots of these screen protectors, so I'll cut to the chase here.  As of the date I bought these, these films were just slightly too large.  None of them could be installed without trimming.  I did end up trimming about 2 mm off the long bottom edge, and rounding those two corners, and getting a reasonable install, albeit not perfect.

Moreover, the films are high-gloss, which look fabulous, until you touch them.  They not only show fingerprints, they *cling* to them.  Which means that after using your tab for five minutes, your screen is covered with fingerprints - to my estimates about three times as bad as the screen alone with no film - and that became too much for me to handle.  I ended up pulling it off and going with a different product.

That said, BlueMall is a fantastic seller, and takes good care of their customers, so buy from them with confidence.  I've bought *many* ""Sold by BlueMall"" items on Amazon, and their service is fabulous.  It's just this particular product that I have issue with.",185,3

It does feel a bit rough because of it's glittery texture.  My only con is that the case does not cover the top, or front of the phone.  From the front view you can't tell there is even a case on.  I dislike this for both reasons--> 1. I want to protect my iphone 4 from scratches and 2. I was hoping I'd be able to enjoy the pretty case from the front as well.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,"I ordered the white Sparkles Hardcase for my wife's iPhone 4 (AT&T) and it snaps on very easily and protects the sides, and back of the phone pretty well. Initially some of the sparkles would come off in your hand, but that is to be expected.  After a couple of days of use, I haven't noticed any on her, or on my hands when I handle the phone.

I have the Sony iPod Alarm Clock/Dock deal, and it charges in that without having to remove the case.

The only problem I notice on a lot of iPhone cases is that there is usually not enough room left around the earphone jack for a standard RCA Y adapter (3.5mm to RCA).  Usually the neck on the 3.5mm (earphone side) is too large.  You will need to get one where the 3.5mm neck is the size of the earphone plug, or purchase a standard RCA to 3.5mm adapter and a 3.5mm pigtail to plug it into.

For the price, definitely worth it.",62,40

My iPhone does fit in my iDock, but I have to jiggle it a bit to make the connection. The sparkly surface is rather rough to touch. This case shipped from China and took several weeks to arrive.",64,42

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,This cover is very cute but not what I thought it would be. The cover is flimsy and the glitter falls off.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,This case took about two weeks to get here. But I was very pleased with the case. But the glitter comes off. So I went and got CLEAR spray paint and did two coats. It prevented the glitter from coming off an it felt better too.,46,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,1.0,negative,"This case was very poorly made. Granted, it was inexpensive, but I have purchased inexpensive cases from amazon before and they turned out fine. This one feels as though it is made of cardboard. I do not recommend this case.",40,53

This is a great case for that price. I haven't used it extensively but it's held up so far. The part I don't love is the edging on the front part. It seems to be made out of a cheap plastic the takes to every dent. Not too noticeable though. I'd recommend it for the price",69,128
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,It's super cute. Defenitly a case just for look and to make ur phone pretty. After a while the glitter kinda starts to ware but for a buck something you can't expect much more.,34,129

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,4.0,positive,I like almost everything about this case. It snaps on and off the phone easily. And makes the phone look pretty.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0054EQQXC,2.0,negative,"The case is cute, but very cheap (of course). In the first hour, my hands and clothing were covered in silver glitter. I didn't use it long because of this and how cheap it feels. I gave it 2 stars only because it is a cute case.",47,149

I carry it in my pocket or hand), and it definitely is not a case to have if you are looking for ANY kind of protection. Made of cheap plastic with NO padding what-so-ever. It does look like the photo though (if you receive the correct color) and fit my iPhone 4 perfectly. Definitely only designed for looks, though. I still gave it 3 stars because you get what you pay for and I paid less than $2 so what can you expect?",127,150

However, it does not have a lip that comes over to the front of the phone, so if you drop your phone, it is likely that the screen might break. The case is overall exactly what I thought it would be. Veryyy sparkly and shinny. It looks great and I have received many compliments. The surfrace is a little scratchy, but nothing that is worth not buying it over. The first few days I had a few glitter specks on my hand which was to be expected, but it did not alter the appearance of the case. Overall, this is a great case. However, if you tend to drop your phone, I wouldnt recommend it.",131,152

I would reccomend that if your putting your phone down on your bed or something make sure to put it screen- down that way your sheets don't pull at the case.

The case edges look like a bunch of sloppy glue let to dry and the area around the camera is not molded to fit at all. the picture shows a perfectly shaped case with almost flat fabric like sequins and thats not at all what you get. not to mention the mess of the glitter. not cool and regret buying this product very much. the thing i was most unsatisfied with is that in the picture, its looks iridescent and its not. its dark gray with some color sprinkles.",128,161

It felt like it would have fallen off really easily if I had dropped it. This case does not provide any protection for the front of the phone either. I like cases that come up over the sides and a little on the front so you get a good fit and this one did not fit the bill. If you're looking for just sparkle with no protection than this case would work but if you need a case that will protect your phone when it is dropped, look for a different case.",138,163

I have a Verizon iPhone 4, and it fit my phone with no problems; no covered-up buttons, no covered ports, etc. I'm disappointed in the scratchy texture, though; the glitter/sparkle on the back definitely feels very rough and sandpaper-like, and when I took the case on a ""test drive"" this afternoon, it drove me CRAZY the way it would snag on fabric and the way it felt whenever I handled my phone. I also agree with a couple other reviewers who mentioned that the lack of sparkle on the part of the case toward the front makes it look weird; you've got a back that's like BLING BANG BAM! & the front looks really plain and strange; especially on the black iPhone, which I have. It might not look too bad on a white one, though.

Overall, the sparkle is REALLY fun and looks awesome when the light hits it, but because of the texture, I don't think I'll be using it for an everyday cover.",196,167

I think the other reviewer's mother lied to her when she said it didn't fit her phone because it fit my AT&T iphone 4 perfectly.  This case is really loud and tacky...just what I wanted when I ordered it but not for everyone.

It's like the phone does not recognize this battery, the charging icon flashes red. The 2nd flaw is that after charging the hyperion overnight I stuck it into my bag for a day trip only to find that it lost it's charge as the day went on so when I needed to use it, it had no charge. :(  I am going to stop by Sprint and get a real genuine battery as a backup.

I switched it sometime back in early August just to see how it works, and obviously it works just as well as my Samsung battery did because I just found my Samsung battery laying on my desk when I thought it was in my phone. The people complaining how bad the battery life is don't understand how smartphones work, this isn't your Nokia 2780 with the green and black screen, you do more than play 'Snake' on your phone... this uses a lot of processor power and uses more juice. I can easily go a whole day with moderate to moderately-high use and my WiFi on the whole time and still have a bit of power left. I cannot comment on the charger since I was sent one that didn't even fit the batteries (which is where the star was lost my rating).

Pros:
Two batteries for less than 1/2 of what one single Samsung replacement would cost.
Seem to be built pretty well.
So far they have held their charge well, I will try to update again in another month to see if the charge is still holding well.

Cons:
None so far.

The battery life is equivalent to the battery that came with my phone (one will last me all day unless I use the phone as a GPS, but now I have a backup battery if I want to do that). I was concerned that the batteries may not charge in my phone, but they do charge in my phone without a problem (so I don't have to pull the back off my phone to replace the battery to charge in the external charger).  If I do want to use the external charger, it charges the battery faster than doing it in the phone (in about 2 hours).

The batteries which is what I really wanted, were to replace (or be used in addition to) the original OEM battery that came with my Galaxy S.  My method of use for the phone has always been the same (bluetooth on, Auto-rotate on, no silent/vibrate for the most part as that drains batteries quickly, email accounts refreshing every minute, no more than 30min of talk/day etc.).  Initially and for the first few months, the Samsung OEM battery would last me up to a day and a half and eventually that got reduced to a full day, but that was fine as it went on the charger overnight.  As expected, after 500+ charges the battery started dying off by early evening prompting me to source new batteries.  These not only last less than that, but also cause th phone to die off suddenly after it has gone into yellow mode, rather than a gradual shutdown (reduction of brightness etc.) that the OEM battery still affords me.
Maybe these are just refurbs from returned or decomissioned phones, rather than new batteries.  Will purchase another OEM one for $20+ to get what I wanted.",237,15

This is a very bad product for its coating, although I still like the kickstand feature. If I can find the kickstand feature with a better finished product this one is history.

I haven't (intentionally or not) dropped my phone but I am confident
that it will protect it from most impact. I paid less than $9 from
Empire Accessories which goes by CNC Imports LLC with Amazon.
For that amount, I feel like I came away with nice product.
It comes with a screen guard as well. I would give it a five
out of five but like most people already pointed out, the kickstand
is flimsy. Handle that with care because the kickstand and the
price was a deal maker for me upon purchase.

This is a one month update.
It's true about the peeling.
So as long as you know you are getting $9 quality.

I like the color contrast; the black with the chrome (color), and the window in the back that highlights the Apple logo.  The case has a soft feel, and fits the iPhone 4 perfectly.  The chrome kickstand is made of plastic, but a nice chrome color.  I wish that mine would have been made of metal, but it serves it's purpose as a kickstand.  I wouldn't rely on the kickstand lasting very long. The case will protect your iPhone, but I'd be afraid if I dropped my phone in this case.  It seems to protect the sides, but the front of the phone is not protected.  Right now I'm using this case on my phone, and I carry this case in a leather pouch that I used for my BlackBerry.

The construction is flimsy, the ""kickstand"" is a slight breeze away from snapping off and when you put the case on you phone you lose 2 bars of reception.  For $9 bucks it is not worth the effort to return then darn thing, but please DO NOT think you are getting a $49 quality case. This is straight off Canal street junk. Avoid.",99,38

Decent fit and finish. 2 piece snap on case that fits well together, no squeaks and keeps phone secure. The chrome look stand and logo hole are plastic and scratch very easily and the stand is super flimsy. I'm very careful with mine and I believe that's the only reason it hasn't snapped off yet. If that piece was better made and the chrome was more durable I'd give it 5 stars.",87,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"I bought this case for my sprint iPhone 4s. I spent about two days researching cases and finally settled on this one for two reasons. One it looked good (which it does look great on the phone), and two it looked like it would provide decent protection for not just the back but also the front of the phone with the raised lip on the cover so the screen actually has a bumper. The kickstand was just an added bonus that I thought would be cool on an other whys great looking case. The kickstand does work but when I first got it I thought I was going to break it off. After having it for about 4 days now the kickstand is still intact and I have gotten use to how to carefully use the kickstand when I want it. Overall it's a great case with a great price, while i was at the sprint store they were selling complete garbage not even close to being as nice as this one for 25-35 dollars.

Too bad, because she loves the color, and it would have been nice if it worked.  The shipping was more than the case, so I doubt it's worth turning this into a federal case, but I do feel like warning the rest of you out there.",96,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0058WQ7Z2,4.0,positive,"At this price point, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality, but the the surprise is that it's pretty darn good.  The case comes in two pieces which snap together around the phone, but not very tightly.  I am guessing if dropped, the case might pop apart which could undermine the reason for the case in the first place.  However the case fits my Torch exactly with a small ""cushion"" of air between it and the phone that should protect it if it is dropped (but I sure wouldn't test it).

The front is raised slightly higher than the face of the phone which helps prevent screen scratches.  The case is hard plastic, but is covered with a rubberized material that seems to be making its way onto alot of electronic products these days.

My only beef is the shipped product is not exactly as pictured on Amazon.  The pictured product shows a window on the back that surrounds the BlackBerry logo (similar to iPhone cases which show the Apple logo).  The case I received doesn't have that.  I chose this case for this very reason because I wanted to 'flash' that I have a BlackBerry instead of an iPhone.",202,3

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005D7HBFW,1.0,negative,"UPDATE:  Initially, I wrote a great review for this product and referred it to many friends.  However, after a few months of very careful use, the plastic around the cables broke leaving the wires exposed.  Not only does this not look good, it's dangerous.  Unfortunately, Phonesuit doesn't stand behind it's products AT ALL.

A great product at first, but poorly made.  I assume that one of the reasons the price keeps dropping is that they know about the problem and are making no effort to fix it.

I've had this for about four months and it has performed like a champ.  It has charged everything I travel with - Surface, iPhone 6s, iPad, iPad keyboard, bluetooth headset.  I usually bring a couple of spare cable so that I can charge three devices at once overnight, but I can also walk out the door with just this and my phone and know that I have a great all in one charging solution.

I especially like that the lightning and micro usb plugs are designed to fit very snug.  I can, in a pinch, actually plug the charger into the wall and the lightning connector into my iPhone at the same time.  Although the cable is not very long, my iPhone will stay in securely even if it can't reach the desk or the floor.  I don't recommend this, but I've done in numerous times and it has once fallen off.

It's especially great when headed out for the night with a low battery, since you can slip it in your pocket and know that you can recharge your devices no matter where you are.

My only concern is that I have sometimes plugged into the wall and left it behind. No fault of the product, though.",295,0

Sometimes with headsets, in an effort to go for lightweight, manufacturers have created flimsy feeling headsets.  Not this one.  It's solid feeling, substantial.  It doesn't feel like it's going to break the first time you use it.  Yet, it's not overly heavy either.  Basically, it's a great headset that does exactly what it advertises.

Matter of fact I forgot my IPhone at a tread mill wondering across the gym to another machine before I realized it.

I went through 2 pairs of these and each one failed after 3 work outs. I am speculating it was sweat that got them. They would just quit working. Sometime they would start working again after a few days but were very intermittent after the first failure. If they had held up to the sweat I would be using them now.

It came on time and it was packaged just like if you had purchased it in a store. The only flaw is that it will not move from the Edge to the 3g or H network of my carrier. My research on the issue has led me to the realization that it is something in the phone and not on my carrier's end. Given it's super fast processor, however you hardly notice it. All around well worth the money:)",94,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005MPZOIG,3.0,neutral,"Just received the phone and have not used it enough yet to review everything. The phone itself should be great, had good reviews on the web. I gave it four stars because of these things:
1- It's made in china.
2- You need to have nails to open the battery cover. You need to push and hold down the release then pull off the cover using other finger's nail. I hate that
3- It does not have US English.
4- It's not a US version neither a European version. It's Asian version. It has all Asian languages, but no US English or European language.
5- it does not pick up 4G on tmobile, just 3G.
Update: I gave it first time 4 stars, now giving it only 3 stars because HTC is not supporting this phone anymore. The last software update to android 4.0.3 was back in december 2012, now the jelly bean 4.2.2 is out there but HTC says that the sensation xe is not getting it. Why? no answers.
What I'm doing? switching to Samsung!!!

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005MPZOIG,4.0,positive,I bought the phone because of the beat audio headset but I got a regular headset in the box.

The OS is very good and it seems to have more features than the Inspire.,63,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005MPZOIG,3.0,neutral,"I was really excited to get this phone, but am feeling quite let down by the battery. Even if I do nothing on the phone, it still needs recharging at the end of the day. This is after I have taken all the recommended suggestions for minimising power usage. Seriously, it should last at least a couple of days on one charge with minimal usage. Also, it takes an eternity to recharge.

I find this phone really annoying, because it promises so much, yet the rubbish battery puts a big dent in my overall opinion. I've checked on some replacement batteries - Mugen looks super powerful but too bulky, Anker looks like a bit of a boost for a reasonably fair outlay.

I agree with the other reviewer about removing the back case - wow, is that hard! I'm scared I'll break the thing. Also, USB connector to the phone is very difficult to fit in the socket.

I'm surprised at the high ratings - is battery life not so important? Do you all really think it's acceptable to need a recharge every day with minimal usage? I'd hate to be an avid Youtube viewer or music listener - the power would be out before the end of the day. Although I've put three stars, I'll give it a rating of 2 1/2.",223,10

you can buy the phone including dre beats headsets(the big box) from other sellers from amazon with only 20usd more like FGS

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005MPZOIG,3.0,neutral,"i simply love this phone,, it does everything i need it to do and more. its a good looking phone as well.

PROS
-It has dual core, 1.5Ghz processor ,there is no lag and I have been on flash heavy sites, been playing lots of different games which demand alot from the processor .
-The display is very crisp. Colors are sharp and very nice.
-Audio quality is very good. The beats setting gives you more bass which I like.
-Its metallic finish is simply perfection.
-Photos are amazing.

CONS
- I did not receive any beats audio headphones when I bought this product. I emailed the seller and I even emailed HTC themselves, but didn't get much help. They both said that it was shipped in the box, however I just got the standard headset. I have nothing to disprove them,  felt as tho I was robbed,, its nonsense cause I didn't get what I had paid for. The seller wanted to give me a $20 refund to compensate for the ""lost"" headphones, but that won't replace it, nor would it be able to buy a pair of beats audio in-ear headphones. Obviously I was very disappointed.

Overall this is a great phone. I would recommend it to anyone, just buy a good case for it, cause I dropped mine and nearly had a heart attack. Still very disappointed about the headphones.",233,15

However two things that I notice that may be problematic for other people are that the mirror tends to muck up a bit easier than my old screen protector, and it is really difficult to use while outside when it's sunny.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,"I love this guy!  This is the perfect accessory for a place like Los Angeles, where looking good is almost as essential as having a cell phone. This really does turn your Samsung into a makeshift mirror - in a pinch, I've used it to put on eyeliner, touch up makeup, gaze at myself when bored, obsess over a budding pimple, etc.

The great thing is, even though you may effectively be walking down the street staring into a hand mirror, no one has to be the wiser.  That is, no-one on the street needs to know you're secretly engrossed in your appearance; to the casual observer, you're simply engrossed in your phone, maybe watching a video, or reading a text message.

For people more concerned with things like ""using your phone"", fear not - this protector is pretty seamless as well. I've never had problems with the touchscreen not registering, etc. I noted other reviews talking about scratches and durability, but I've had this for a while and nothing's really scratched. It does pick up fingerprints like mad, but I'd rather the prints be on the protector than the actual screen itself. That's what you're buying a protector for, right?

I took off one star because the glare can make it difficult to see the screen in bright light. (Still works great as a mirror, though.) That being said, the daylight glare issue is a relative curse affecting nearly every smartphone. Even without the protector I would still have that problem. But I do believe the reflective quality of the mirror accentuates the glare, hence the star knock-off.

I'd still highly recommend this product for those who dream of transforming their phones into a trusty pocket mirror.  Don't be shy - you know who you are!",297,47

This was my first official non-Tracphone and I got it for my freshman year of college : ) It worked perfectly for me and I had it for about 4 years before I started experiencing problems with it. It seemed like a cord was disconnected or something because it works while closed but stops working when I flip it up. This was fine, I just taped it shut, but then I couldn't text or call numbers I didn't already have in my contacts. I read reviews about this phone and there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the charging part of it, but I decided getting the phone I was familiar with was worth the risk. Long story short I ordered this phone, was super excited that it was new and still in its box, and put my old SIM card in it. This new phone does not charge the batteries. I have used the charger it came with, and 2 of my other chargers and it just does not charge.. it says it is charging but as soon as I unplug it, it goes back to ""low batterie."" It is not the end of the world though, I have been switching out the batteries and charging them with my old phone and then putting them back into the new one. It is a bit of a hassle, especially for long phone calls, but it is worth it too me to have the phone I want.

It shut off and we couldn't get it to turn back on. We let it charge overnight, and the battery showed a full charge, but in less than an hour, the battery was dead. We tried another battery. Same thing. We tried a different charging cord, in a different location. The phone just wouldn't allow the battery to charge or hold a charge.

Pros
-Thin

Cons
-No protection whats so ever
-Expensive
-Attracts lint
-Port fittings were not accurate

Overall, the cons out weigh the pros, so I returned it and got a different case (TPU case).",78,2

What I was looking for was a thin, low-profile case, that provided moderate grip, and did not compromise fashion.  This case provided exactly what I was looking for.

For those prone to dropping their phones, I'd suggest not purchasing this, as it does not provide adequate protection, and recommend looking into Incipio's Silicrylic line which provides similar profile as their Feather line, but adds additional bulk and corner protection.  If you're a super clumsy ox, get yourself an otterbox.",94,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0064S5A7U,3.0,neutral,"Just got this shell case today. It is very hard, rigid, which is as advertised. However, I also bought a Distronic TPU case, which is a more durable version of latex pretty much. After trying them both out, I am much more inclined to say that is a better product. It feels better, but additionally, it covers more of the phone. The Incipio case does not wrap around the entire top and bottom chrome portion of the device, leaving it open for damage in case of a fall. Also, it appears that the TPU product will do a better job of protection, as the impact of the fall will be distributed, rather than completely centralized at the point of impact by the Incipio product.

I give it three stars because I think it is a good value. However, I just don't think it's the best option to protect the phone. Just a personal preference, I suppose.",156,5

The worst thing about this case is that it also broke after dropping it just once.  Don't buy this case, unless your goal is to look like a ragamuffin.",78,6

I was displeased, however, when the fabric came off. It is almost as if the glue melted and just would not hold on after that. It was in my pocket, so it wasn't as if I left it in extreme heat.

The buttons (volume and screen-off) take a little breaking-into as they are stiff when you first get them, but this occurs relatively quickly. The case is a tight-fit so there is no fear of it falling off. However, this makes it a little hard to get off. As far as protection quality goes, its probably not the most ideal case but it does the job for the most part. It looks great and I'm pretty careful with my phone so this case worked perfectly for me.",98,17

The case itself was in poor shape. The fabric that the design was on was beginning to come off on the bottom and back, and after a couple weeks of continued use, eventually fell off completely.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"I originally purchased this case at a Best Buy. It worked fine for about 3 months. Then the fabric sticker on the side of the case began peeling off. I had to PULL TEETH to get Speck to replace the case with a new one. 3 months later - same issue. They said that this type of problem is from different lotions on my hands, or environmental issues like humidity. I'm a guy. I don't use hand lotions. I live in Southern California - it's warm and dry.

Speck fails to recognize that they've put out a SUB-STANDARD product to their consumer base. This case is not worth your time. The fabric sticker will start to peel with normal use. It's cheaply made JUNK.

Oh, and for all my troubles with them - they offered me a 20% discount on another JUNK case they make. No thanks Speck. I will NEVER buy another of your products again and I hope consumers at Amazon read this and see how poor quality their products are.",173,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"I'm not sure what all these negative reviews are about, I think they're just not sure how to put on a phone case. I've heard that the case is too tight and hard to get off? Well it is tight on your phone, but isn't that what you want? I've heard it's too big and the phone slides around, but it fits my iPhone 4s perfectly. All my cords fit fine, and there's plenty of room, even for my aux jack in my car. The volume buttons and off button are kind of hard to use AT FIRST, but I got used to it within a day of using it and now I don't even notice. So far the fabric is clean and not frayed or anything, but I assume over time it'll get dirty, no big deal though, it's what to expect with fabric. If you're really annoyed by that possibility then just get some spray that people put on shoes or something and that should help, or just get a phone case that isn't made of fabric. I would probably suggest buying a new one rather than a used one if you want it to look perfect and not dirty or damaged. If you don't really care and just want protection I'd say go for whatever you want! Love this case, the colors are awesome!",227,21

They have fun colors and designs plus they really protect the phone. I've accidentally dropped my phone face down outside on the pavement. I picked it up - no damage to the phone. None at all. The case is secure and wraps all the way around with a raised beveled edge around the screen. The cut-outs are large enough not to cause problems (especially on the camera cut-out) while still protecting the camera lens and the plugs. I've never had a problem with the press-thru buttons for the volume and on buttons. I click the up volume and the volume instantly gets louder. When the fabric starts to show some dirt, I simply remove the phone, then use a mild soap to wash it. Let it dry completely and it looks brand new. The only reason I've bought so many is I like to switch it up once in a while with a new color/pattern. But I always get another Speck and am a loyal Speck iPhone case user.",189,23

The whole ""OMG this is great, bla bla"" or ""WTF da suq"" is what many reviews end up being.  I decided to give this a shot because it was right in the middle and I really liked the pixelated look on of the sides and back.

I could not have been more wrong.

The first one I ordered, had the fabric coming unglued at the bottom of the case near where the 30 pin connector would go within a week of getting it.  I contacted Amazon and they generously sent me out another.  I thought I might have been a fluke, mail back the original and used the new.

Fast forward a week and half after it is out of return status from Amazon and it's doing the same exact thing again.

I tried to contact Specks for help, but never got a response, I left a message on their voicemail system but to no avail, and the company is absolutely worthless with their online chat.

What ever you do, don't get this case.  You will end up regretting it later on down the road.",202,32

Colorful, durable, but after a while the glue used to fasten the fabric to the plastic shell started coming undone.  So I came to Amazon to find a replacement.

The SPK-A1009 I received was put together poorly.  The fabric pieces had not been lined up properly on the plastic shell and so the fabric sticks out over the lip along the bottom of the case.  Also the fabric piece that runs the along the side with the volume buttons is somewhat frayed toward the bottom.  I fear this case won't last half as long as the original I picked up.",120,37

The printed material on the back is essentially a glued on piece of fabric, which showed signs of peeling already when I received it.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"This is a great little case, fits well, nice colors. I like the protection, I've dropped my iPhone 4 several times with nary a scratch. However, be warned that the color areas are done in a thin cloth which picks up dirt, dust, coffee etc. and within a week the colors are already stained and faded. Washing with a cloth does not seem to help. I love this case but had not expected the colors to be damageable cloth.

UPDATE 11/13/12: I've had this case for a few months now and it continues to provide good protection, but the colors have become so dirty and stained just by normal use that it now looks grimy and disgusting and I'm going to have to buy another.

It was just as cute as it looked online, B. It seemed durable, and C. it fit my phone (iphone 4, not 4s)perfectly. I was happy for a few months with this product, until I tried to dock it.

The bottom of this case is really thick so the only way to dock the phone on an iHome or any similar device, is to remove it from the case. This would not be a big deal except that the case is a PAIN to take on and off. I really thought I was going to snap my phone in half the first time I tried to take the case off. I am hunting around again for a different case because I need to take this one off at least twice a day and its just not worth it.",164,53

Previously I had a ""two piece"" SPECK case and it lasted for one or two drops (depending on impact) before a corner broke apart, leaving the case useless (which is better than a broken screen, IMO).

I've had this for a month or so, and have no issues with the fit of the case. The bottom fit is a little loose, but my phone doesn't slide around in the case, only the bottom lip have a little bit of give. All in all, for the price this is good and has met my expectations.",108,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"I bought this case because 1. it looks really nice and I love the colors and 2. I heard Speck was a good brand.  Even though I liked the case, I returned it since I wasn't able to use my AUX cord in my car to play music. If you have a standard AUX cord, it will not plug in the whole way.

-The fabric is CHEAP and was poorly attached, was already coming off right out of the packaging.

-The case doesn't even fit the phone correctly and there was a large amount of room for the phone to slide back and forth... unacceptable.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"I orginally wanted the Burton Fabshell, but did not find any on amazon, so I bought this one instead. Love the color scheme of this case and the feeling of it. Like many people say, this case is sort of like a combination of the candyshell and speck fitted case. I own the candyshell case, but found it sometimes too bluky when I put it in my jean pocket. I also didn't like that the fitted cases didn't cover the volume and sleep buttons. So I find that th fabshell cases are a perfect mix between those two cases.  It's not bulky and it has the design of the fitted case.

However some cons includes: the cloth may get dirty over time depending on your lifestyle of course (for me I use my phone all the time, I bring it everywhere - the gym, park, etc) Also I feel like the bottom part of the  case below the home button may eventually begin to sag -depending on how you treat your case.

I hope my review helped feel free to respond and ask questions :)",118,18

I don't drop my phone a lot but in  the few times I have since using this case, it's done its job. 4 stars because the ears don't stay on, and the case can slip off kind of easily in your purse or bag.

A couple days later i came to check up on my tracking and delivery, I noticed that I could see reviews on the purchase I made, all I saw was negative comments and how it was not worth buying I kind of felt iffy about it. Couple days later i received my envelope and opened to find the lilo and stitch case and I fell in love with it instantly , it's not the way it looks in the picture just the nose color is different and the ears inside and the toes but other than that its adorable and cute coming with the screen protector , recommend people to buy it.

I had the case on the phone for about four days during these four days I was contacting people to try and purchase a car. When I called the dealers not hearing back from them they stated that they called several times but never could reach me. I am not sure if the case had anything to do with it.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,"It was really cute when I got it, it's the first iphone case that I got for myself. No technical problems at all, except that the colors of the ears were not tan, they were actually the same color as the body itself. The nose was not purple, but red. The toes got dirty really easily, and some of the material on the toes got scrapped off. As long as you don't drop it, it should last for awhile. In case you do drop it, its okay. I dropped mine after 2 weeks, it sliced open and all the buttons on the side popped off. BUT, i was able to fix it easily by putting in back the buttons and just super gluing the sides back together.  People say its big, but its actually not, it fits my back pocket just perfect with its head peeking out. I give this item an overall 4 because although its not exactly like the picture, its close,  cheap, cute, and very fixable. What i do recommended if you get this item is to keep the ears closed at most times. Not only do keeping the ears in will keep your screen untouched from a table's surface but it will keep it from breaking.",210,152

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,"WARNING: it is NOT the same stitch as shown in the picture. If you look at the other pink stitches sold by other Amazon sellers, that's what it looks like, Ears are pink, there is no purple heart nose. I chose this one because it looked different from the rest, but guess not.

BESIDES THAT, it's ADORABLE STILL, of course. It came in 4 weeks. I wish it would've come sooner, but they it's from China (airmail), so I can't be too stingy there. I bought a used one, and it doesn't look used at all (unlike the Blue stitch i ordered) Hopefully the ears won't break like my blue one did as well. It didn't come in a nice packaged box, but it wasn't broken, there was no damage. It just came in a plastic seal with a screen protector :) The nose is beautiful velvet red and it's sweet and feminine. The buttons match fine with my Iphone 4S. You have to take the head off to turn it on silent which I personally don't give a shist about. I'd recommend it, just keep in mind it's not the one shown in the picture. that is all. Over and Out :)
Another thing is that when the ears are in, it covers up a bit of the top of the screen..it gets annoying..you'll have to deal with it.
Ear phone jack and charger jack, once its in it's hard to take out (if you're paranoid about breaking something)...same goes with the case..it won't come off ;/ (strange)",259,240

It's still a cute case, but not as cute as it could be. With the vibration button being on the side of the phone, it is hard to keep my phone on ring because when putting on her head, the button pushes down and puts the phone on vibrate. Other than these things, the case is really cool. It's very sturdy. I've dropped my phone a few times with this case and there has been no damage on either the phone or the case.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006QYY88E,1.0,negative,"After buying two cheap leather holsters for my iPhone with Mophie Juice protective battery pack cover, and having both of them break within less than a month, one causing my iPhone to drop onto the sidewalk, I finally bought this case.  At first I was very pleased with it, but three months down the road I am very disappointed.  The ridges on the rotating part of the clip have worn down making the clip loose, spinning upside down easily while wearing on your belt and potentially dumping the phone out.  Then the other day the clip broke right off.

So I thought I should contact Mophie for warranty.  No response after one week filing a warranty request on their website!  Why can't someone make a holster for a ""fat"" iPhone which will last?  I had one for my old blackberry that outlasted the phone!",144,5

The problem first occurred after about 6 months, the leather case detached from the belt clip and fell to the ground.  Using a pen and a lot of pressure, I was able to push the connector back into the belt clip...in hind sight I should have just returned the holster for warranty service (I didn't because I figured they would say getting out of the car with the case on my hip was abuse).  Since then the holster pops off about 1 time every other week, and today the connector embedded in the case finally broke completely (I will upload a pic).  I don't see how it can be repaired so I am left with a piece of trash or trying to fix it myself.  To be clear, the case connector is simply a bad design (weak).  I had blackberry cases for many years on my hip without a single issue like this .  I wish I could find a blackberry case  that would fit the mophie.  The other problem I had was the phone and case combo was heavy enough to pull the phone off your hip unless it is on your belt.  Clipping it to your pocket on khakis would fall off 100% of the time.  The case did do a good job protecting the phone from hitting the floor, so I am giving it a neutral rating.",240,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006QYY88E,2.0,negative,This product worked perfectly for the mophie juice pack Air external battery case.  The swivel was especially useful for belt use.

---UPDATE 1-23-2013---
So, as others have suggested, the clip finally broke. To the case's credit, I clipped to my belt on my left hip, which I only do during the winter when playing tuba at MSU (sorry for the digression, but the sousaphone rests on the right hip, hence the change), and it snagged on the car door pillar as I hurried out of the car when I was late to play the basketball gig. This happens practically once every winter, as I normally wear my cases on my right hip to prevent this from occurring. Well, I figured I was out $30. But, the next weekend, the Mophie battery itself broke; the USB charging port broke off inside the case. I contacted Mophie and received a RMA number for the battery and returned it to them under warranty. I placed the battery inside the broken case with a post-it note that the case clip was broken the same weekend. Even though the case was not part of my warranty claim, when I received the replacement battery, the good people at Mophie replaced the case, too! Now that's what I call customer service.",215,36

I've read a number of reviews where this clip has broken and I can see how this could happen, it's entirely too brittle,'plastic-y' weak link for a relatively heavy phone/powered case combo, and the ratchet mechanism is SO going to wear quickly and spin around like a pinwheel over time. If you're willing to put out a 100 dollar case AND a 30 dollar holster, why not commit and have a holster thats in keeping with the quality of the marque?? I don't understand WHY the good folks at Mophie didn't do a little much needed R and D and come up with a better, lower profile, ALL METAL clip for this thing!? Its Irritating as #&!! they didn't assume someone who's buying a relatively expensive case is already interested in high levels of quality and protection for their fone and would want anything less than quality materials on the holder here! I don't mind paying more, but let me buy it ONCE and buy it right!  LOVE the case, dislike the holster as is. Mophie as to do a rework on this design FLAW. Please. and Soon.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006QYY88E,1.0,negative,"I ordered the Mophie Hip Holster to allow me to store my iPhone 4S on the left side of my belt. I don't like storing bulky things, especially cell phones in my pockets. After receiving this case in the mail, I observed that the leather portion of the case was well designed and of high quality, but the construction of the clip was very poor. For the size of the case, I expected that the clip would be made bigger to handle all of the torque and stress an end user would normally exert on it. This past Saturday after opening my car and sitting down the leather portion of the case separated from the plastic clip.

As mentioned the plastic clip should be made larger to handle all the torque and stress the end user would normally exert on it. Perhaps the plastic clip could be made out of aluminum or other high quality metal. When my case broke some small plastic pieces connecting the plastic clip to the leather case fell off and I have no idea where they went. So there is no way I could glue them together.

The reason I gave this product 1 star is because I can no longer clip the case to my belt. If the case was usable, I would probably give a 4 or 5 star rating.

I filled out and submitted a technical support form on Mophie's website and have received an RMA and a prepaid USPS label, so I will send the hip holster case out first thing tomorrow. I'm hoping to receive a $29.99 credit to my account.",271,47

The Iphone4 with Mophie fits perfect, its not to snug, easy to get in and out, and just works. The flap is a flip up with magnetic seal so its easy access and firm closed. I wear this with a belt most of the time, but you can get by without a belt. The case is not so large to look odd or feel like a gun holster on your hip either.

I was considering getting a larger battery that would require a new case, adding bulk to my phone, however I'm glad I went with this one.  Under the same conditions as before, and with a properly conditioned battery,  I'm able to maintain a working charge well after I'm on my way home, 6:30 PM in most cases.  When I get home, I usually have 10% or so left.  By the time I go to bed, 10:00ish, the phone is pretty much done, assuming a don't use it much after I'm home.  But the combination of properly conditioning the battery and the extended life are just about perfect for my needs during the week.  On weekends when I hand off the phone to the kids or with heavy use, I need to put it on a charger around 2 PM to get throught the day.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,2.0,negative,"The look of the case is really cute, however, on the case I received it bubbles out a little bit over the area where the volume buttons are located. Also, the spray paint used on the case does not cover the plastic base entirely so flecks of grey show through in places. All in all it is a really cool looking phone case...from a far...but will not pass close sructiny. In the end, I paid very little for it so I can't exactly expect that it is flawless.",88,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006W503DQ,3.0,neutral,"I have ordered 2 cases, were on time, color is good, but gets dirty very soon. Looks fine on my iphone 4.",22,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,"I liked the design of this case; it was solidly built, and if had a good feel on the phone. But the design is applied HORRIBLY to the case. It looks like a clear case with a sticker on it. The design is supposed to go all the way around the sides, but it stops short and looks cheap",59,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,"I was really excited about this case but when I received it, it didn't look the way I expected. The image looks like it was stretched to fit the dimensions of the cover, so not only does it look unrealistic, it looks pretty stupid. The dimensions of a cassette tape are not the same as an iphone so it looks strange when you see it, which is not represented by the picture. Good thing it was cheap.",77,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,"of course this cover is wicked cute--who doesn't want their phone to look like a cassette tape from their youth? be warned, however, that this case is not in the least bit protective. there's no bumper of any kind--it's purely for looking awesome...which it accomplishes well.",46,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,"Not what I expected, it looked very real in the picture but when I was not so real, in fact I do not like!",24,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,True. It's hard plastic and husband works as welder. It has taken a lot of abuse.....ppl really think he's talking to a cassette tape!!!,24,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,"This item was causing a glare on all photos taken. Had to take a black sharpie and color on the case around the camera hole to stop the glare. Other than that, it is a good case.",37,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,"Horrible! Received the product thinking i could actually use it for some sort of protection, WRONG! It's literally the cheapest kind of plastic out there, the sticker or whatever they put on it doesn't even go all around the edges/sides of the product! Once you put it on, you literally have to pry it off with something, PLUS the edges of it are extremely sharp which makes it even harder to take off! Doesn't even look good. Unless you're going on a spending spree for things ugly things you'll never use, you shouldn't even consider this product.",97,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,2.0,negative,"Not a synthesized cassette like the cute rubberized ones you see out there. If you went to a website like cafepress and uploaded a picture of a cassette face to an iPhone cover, this is what you would get.

Yes, it's basically a picture of a cassette on the back of an iphone cover, you will not get that ""Are you carrying around a cassette?"" reaction because it's rather clearly an iPhone cover and not...well, a cassette!

The good- it's hard and does not flop off. If you really hate that the rubberized cute ones fall off, but you just want the image of a cassette without your phone being morphed into one, you can buy this case. It's not really worth me returning it so sadly I will try to bestow it on someone or recycle it. Not a fan.",141,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,It took about 3-4 weeks to get to me which sucked since Im an impatient person but thats not really the worst part. When I receive the phone case I immediately put it on my phone. It didn't fit. I have a 4s and the case is for a 4. Doesn't matter since the 4/4s are the same size so it should have fit but one side just didn't reach all the way around to latch on my phone completely. I won't bother returning it since its a cheap case anyways and Id most-likely have to pay for shipping. The picture of the cassette wasn't all that great either but I expected that. Oh well. With it being so cheap you get crap quality so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,131,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,"Bought this for a friend who needed cases. He liked it, it's working for him. Can't complain. It's doing its job",21,9

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,"I liked the design (i'm old enough to remember owning many of the real thing), the price wasn't bad at all and the case arrived much sooner than I had anticipated; however the picture printed on the case is slightly diagonal and stretched toward the end--it wouldn't be so obvious if it weren't for the fact that the numbers are printed there.",62,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,This product is lousy! You definitely are paying for what you recieve. The print looked horrible and the plastic would hardly withstand a good fall. Do not spend your money on this case. =(,34,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,"This is not even a printed decal -- it's like a copy-machine copy of another case. This thing is a joke. The plastic/rubber is also really flimsy, the phone will slip out easily.",33,14

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,It was not protective of my iphone and the design on the case looked like it was printed on badly.,20,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,1.0,negative,"I was very disappointed in this product. Of the three covers I ordered this one took the longest to arrive, when it finally arrived the cover was very distorted so much so that it doesn't look like a cassette. It made me sad because of the three it's the one I really wanted.  I would've returned it but I felt it wasn't worth it because it was $2. I would order another one but I don't want to risk getting another bad one.",83,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,This is such a fun case! Everyone thinks my phone is actually a cassette tape when the back side is side up. I really enjoy it!,26,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,"It's better than the average cassette cases you see because those are hard to get in and out of your pocket whereas this case somehow still has a soft unique texture but goes in and out of your pocket so easily! Slim fit, doesn't make your phone look bulky at all. But it is just a picture on the back not actual cassette looking which is fine with me. Arrived 2 weeks before estimated delivery date! :D",77,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,5.0,positive,I love this case! I show it off to everyone. Looks so real and was super cheap. I've even dropped it a few times and hasn't cracked or chipped.,29,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,"the design is great, i get a lot of compliments on it but its overall manufacture is just average at best.",21,22

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,Love it but its really hard to get case off while on the phone. Great case though. Would order again.,20,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,4.0,positive,This item is plastic buy perfectly priced and stylish. I would definitely purchase again from same vendor/brand. Much better than the overpriced store versions.,24,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,It came weeks earlier than expected and it's a really cool case just a bit tricky to remove. Overall though great purchase and so affordable.,25,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006XKYHX2,3.0,neutral,"You shouldn't buy this if you have high hopes for a phone case. It's just a plastic back to your iPhone and it won't provide much coverage or protection fr your phone. However, I take pretty good care of my phone and this case does its job for me. I was just looking for a cool looking case that wouldn't make my phone feel too fat and wouldn't hurt my wallet. This works just fine",75,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,5.0,positive,I love this case. Pink and blue are my two favorite colors. I also love the way it feels. It's soft. This is the case that I use majority of the time. It is very durable also. I've dropped my phone a few times and it is still in great shape.,51,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,3.0,neutral,"The color is awesome, but when the camera flashes it leaves every picture with a bad blue tint (because the blue case is so close to the camera).",28,1

Its to flimses it would break easy no what i wanted thought it was hard case",20,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,2.0,negative,I was expecting this case to be held together a little better than it is.  The outside shell doesn't fit very snug and when I opened the package it wreaked of toxic plastic. I had to let it air out for a week before I put it on my phone. Not sure how long I'll actually use it. Its cute but I'm hard on my phone and need something I can count on. This is not it!,77,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,4.0,positive,"It's a nice case, but didn't like the fact that the bottom had a complete cover over plug, of which I had to cut off in order to easily access, and it doesn't line up perfectly with the buttons.  All in all, it's a nice cover and protects it well.",50,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,5.0,positive,I got this case cause my granddaughter really wanted it and when she received it she was very happy with it and really liked the color it was.,28,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,5.0,positive,I love this case. I bought a bunch of different types and this is the one I'm keeping on my phone. I love the color and it fits great! I have the white Iphone and it still looks great. I'm the type of person who likes a lot of protection for my phone but because of this case I've gotten rid of the bulky outterboxes.,65,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,5.0,positive,The case is great but the color n the pic wasn't the same as what i got but over all its wuz good. It took a while to ship but i guess is was worth the wait.,37,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,4.0,positive,"I love the colors of the case. However, I'm not impressed with the case in general. The rubber is extremely loose out of package.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,1.0,negative,This case which comes in two pieces is incredibly flimsy. the silicone layer barely stays on the phone and the top pink plastic layer has a tough time fitting on the blue silicone piece. It's not at all protective and I am not even planning on using this. It looks cute but it wasn't worth even the $3 or so I paid for it.,64,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,5.0,positive,"I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves.  She has never had a smart phone before, so she was nervous about carrying one around with her, but now that she has this case she no longer has to worry",41,17

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,4.0,positive,I love this case. It looks so good on my phone. The only problem I have is that I have to take the top part of the case off to use my earbuds and have to take the bottom off to make the charger fit. It does not bother me to do that because the case looks so good on my phone.,62,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,3.0,neutral,"Only complaint about the case, is when taking pics using the flash the color of your case reflects a halo around your picture. I just pop the hard case off if I need my flash. Otherwise it's a great deal.",40,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,2.0,negative,I had this case maybe 2 weeks and I noticed the pink piece of the case wasn't flexible. Next thing I knew it was broke!!!! Can't have one piece without the other. Other than that it would have been a cute protective case for my iPhone 4,47,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,3.0,neutral,Case works! I've dropped my iPhone a couple times and no scratches.. Only complaint is that the charger outlet is hard to access because the rubber material gets mangled sometimes but other than that it protects the phone,38,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,1.0,negative,"I received this case in the mail yesterday. The color is completely different from what the picture looks like. The colors are a lot darker. I put it on my phone and one side of the silicone case, where the volume controls are, is really loose and bent. This case does have a good feel to it and I do like the charger port cover but there are so many cons. When you take a picture with flash, the pictures come out entirely blue. It's awful. When I received this case there were these little black things all over the pink plastic mesh part. I tried to scratch them off but it didn't really work. I just feel that this case is horrible quality and you really get what you pay for, cheap. I would love this case if looked like the picture and it didn't have so many problems. I would never recommend this case to anyone else. Really think before you waste money on this product.",168,25

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0073BS0RE,4.0,positive,"I like the case and always get alot of compliments on it because of the color. When I take pictures using the flash, the pics have a blueish tint to them. I took a black magic marker and filled in the blue part around the outside of the camera. Its temporary though, the magic marker will wear off so you would have to fill it in again. But it's not a bother to me bc I rarely use my flash and plus I switch my cases up. Other than that, the case does protect my phone and its durable.",99,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,"This is a well-made leather case, which fits the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx fairly well.  The case cover is thick leather with a lining, which makes the flap stick out a bit when closed. There are slots at the bottom which makes it easy to remove the phone by pushing up with a finger.  The belt clip is detachable, and has a hook on the end to prevent it from slipping off your belt - a feature that is essential.  However, with enough pressure, as when getting into a car seat, the clip will detach, but it's easy to reinsert it.  There is another flap clip with a snap, but this is upside down and will come unsnapped with used on a belt.
Now a warning about the magnetic clasp.  The Razr Maxx has a well-known problem with the magnetic sensor, which is used for the compass function. If the phone is exposed to a strong magnet, the sensor can become frozen and the compass will not work.  This happened to me with this case, and also to my partner, who has the same phone.  It's easy enough to unstick it - Google it.  But to prevent it from happening, I pried out the magnet with a screwdriver.  It comes out easily with no damage to the case.  I replaced the magnetic clasp with a couple of pieces of Velcro, and I'm very happy with the result.",237,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,2.0,negative,"This case was nice and constructed well, but it has two real bad design flaws.  First, when I tried to wear it with my slacks and no belt I immediately saw that the plastic clip was set way too low on the back of the case.  This as the effect of letting the case and my phone sag away from my body and stick out at about a 60 degree angle.  The case was always getting bumped and snagged on everything.  When I tried wearing it with jeans and a belt, just using the leather belt snap, it rode on my belt like it should, fairly snug against my waist.  I thought that I could at least wear it that way, but the snaps are way too weak and it would come unsnapped when I was getting out of my car.  I wound up giving it to a coworker who has the same phone, but I don't think he likes it either.  It is still sitting on his desk and he is not using it.",175,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,3.0,neutral,"It seems to be well made, but the clip causes the whole thing to stick too far off my side.",20,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,1.0,negative,"I love the design of the case. It easily handles the Razr and provides fast access. Now with this being said, the magnetic button that hold the case closed ripped out in two months! Had this had a flat magnet design this wouldn't of happened. Now I need to go out and buy another one. I guess you get what you pay for..but good only for a couple of months..really?!",70,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,"The case design is perfect.  The open slot on the bottom of the case makes sure that the on/off button does not get pressed while in the case.  I had a solid case before and wondered why my battery was not lasting very long, the phone was turning on while in the case.  It will not happen in this case when the phone is placed in it correctly.  The magnetic catch is strong enough for normal use.  I added a piece of self-adhesive velcro to the flap to make sure it stays closed, but I have to admit, I am rough on cell phones and cases.  I do like the way it hooks on your belt, the extra piece that snaps is very secure.  Absolutely no way for it to slip off of your belt.  Again, best design that I have found for the Motorola Razr Maxx.  Also shipping was very prompt. Purchased from Cell-Stuff thru Amazon.",157,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,"This case fits the Droid RaxrMaxx HD perfectly.  The magnetic clasp on the flap is nice and strong.  What I like most about this case is the belt clip and belt strap arrangement.  First, the belt clip has a bottom hook to hook under your belt to keep the case from coming off the belt.  Next, there are two snap straps that come around the belt in the opposite direction.  Your belt is totally captured by this case and it's impossible for the case to come off your belt.  Great value.  I had one of these for a long time and it lasted nicely.  Time to refresh so I got another.",111,6

Con:  The plastic holster clip on this doesn't stay in place well.  The case fell off of the holster clip on the first day my husband used it.  The snap on the leather strap is weak as well.

The connect is sleek,fast & the screen is amazing. However I do not think that the great qualities out-numbered the bad. The most annoying thing is that the battery finishes like every hour. I am not running any more apps than what I did on my HTC. The bluetooth,wifi & gps satellites are all off to save the battery but it doesn't help. I don't get if the phone's nova screen & the dual-processor takes a lot of power,why would metro pcs sell the phone with only a 1500mAh when there are other strengths out there available like the 1800 mAh? smh. Now I have to consider spending another $30-$45 on an extended battery which makes the phone even bulkier.
Another thing i dislike about the phone is the front camera, it is not as excellent as the rear-facing camera. I wouldn't mind using the rear-facing camera if there was a shutter button on the side i can use, since i can't see on the screen if i'm trying to take a pic of myself.
If the battery & front cam were better i would be more satisfied considering the price paid for phone-not exactly cheap.",221,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,"This phone is the best phone on MetroPCS as of May 2012.  The processor is fast. There is plenty of memory, the 4g speeds are great (for MetroPCS).  There are only two draw backs, the battery life and the power button.  Battery life is a typical problem for all smart phones, I still ended up buying a 2600 maH after market battery so that I could make it through the day.  A car charger and extra wall chargers are an absolute necessity if you want to be sure to have juice all day. The other annoyance is the power button.  It is set slightly more centered on the top, the button is not where you would expect to find it.  It is also flush with the surface making it difficult to feel. Since it is used frequently to unlock the screen you can see how this would be an issue.

 The screen is large enough that my now aging eyes can see it but it is not so large that I can't slip it in my pocket. The display is bright and sharp.

Of course it does all the normal Android things. Since you're reading this, you likely have already compared the raw factory specs so there is no point in listing all the basic info.  If you haven't seen them, scroll up the page give them a look.

Was it worth the cash? Yes",242,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,2.0,negative,this is a decent enough smartphone. Fast and easy to use. The major flaw with this phone is that the battery drains VERY fast.. i cant use my gps for 30miles without having it on charge. if you plan on buying this phone u need to get the car charger and also a extended battery pack wouldn't be a bad idea either.. When i use the phone as a gps unit whilst on charge it won't actually charge it just stops it discharging. Phone gets VERY hot and comes up with a message saying place phone in cool area just before it shuts down... if you have the money id recommend something from verizon but not a bad buy if yo lik dem gettopcs fones.,125,2

If you use car charger and have GPS on, the battery gets so hot you can't hold the phone or have it in your lap while driving.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,"The title says it all ... I have owned my LG connect since May 2012. It is fast and responsive. The build quality, like all LG phones is superb. I have accidentally dropped this phone a few times (I use a simple gel case) with absolutely no damage to the phone.
Battery:
Yes, depending on usage, the battery life can be as short as 8 hours (with a fair usage of Google Maps / Navigator which seems to eat up the battery).
Also, I use the LG HB-700, stereo bluetooth, hands-free unit (another product that you will wonder how you did without) and have found that this also tends to lessen the battery life. the solution is simply to plug in the phone when I am driving or sitting at my desk typing (and streaming music to my bluetooth headset).
Negative Comment:
The only real negative comment that I can offer is that the location on the keyboard for the ""change language setting key"" is so horribly placed that you will find yourself suddenly typing in a foreign language when you accidentally hit the dreaded key. It should not even be on the keyboard! Aughhhhh!

This device was fun to play with in the beginning, fairly easy to setup, but difficult to use everyday.  Sometimes the swipes don't register, and sometimes they register the opposite of what I intended.  There's no easy manual or tutorial either, so if you don't enjoy playing with a new toy for a while to learn it, stay away.

I have 3 hours of cycling commuting to/from work.  I have an HTC One X+ phone and I run Google Track to see my progress.  I also run TuneIn radio and listen to music using my LG HBS700 Bluetooth headset.

I got it ... opened it ... hooked it to a computer and updated its firmware.  I got excited at home and after playing around with it I found the plug-ins needed to do what I want it to.  I even installed the LiveView Charm that is supposed to help with the Bluetooth connection.  I start my ride and run the MicroTrack on the LiveView and Google Track on the phone, start my radio and go ...

The watch constantly connects and disconnects ... it interfere with my music on the Bluetooth headset and makes it choppy and eventually freezes up by itself and puts me in a bad move for that ride.

The pros: it vibrates when you get a phone call/text/email/facebook update, plus you can read your messages as well as facebook statuses. Definitely a conversation starter.

Cons: there are not enough plug-ins for it. Also, the bluetooth connect is AWFUL! It disconnects if it is on my left wrist with my phone in my right pocket! Ridiculous. It truly is a waste of money.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,3.0,neutral,"Overall I am happy that I bough this thing, because I was able to learn for a cheap price that a smart watch is not as useful in person (at least with the tech that's out now). The watch worked and connected with my phone (once you download the app) without any problems. The watch is a little bulky and the band that it comes with is fairly cheap as expected. The reason I isn't as useful though is that any convenience that you would get out of the watch is lost because you have to charge it. It also is more work to go through messages on the watch that it is to just pull out my phone from my pocket. The only thing this watch saves me time on is allowing me to check the time without pulling out my phone. This can be accomplished with a cheap regular watch though.

I was really excited to get this, but was definitely disappointed with it. I gave it a couple weeks for it to grow on me, but now it just sits on my desk collecting dust. Considering it was only $20, I can't complain too much.

If you think a smart watch might be for you and are thinking about getting a more expensive one, you might want to try this out first since it's only $20. Obviously it wouldn't be as nice as a pricier one, but you may be able to learn like I did if you would actually use it.

I bought one locally and it did the dead battery dance,  returned it and the replacement did the same.  Hoping that amazon had better stock, I ordered one and it did the same thing.  All of them out there have batteries that are at the end of life.

Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,"Almost everyone is asked to be on a team in order to solve a problem.  Few are prepared for the experience.  The McKinsey Way is a good primer for anyone placed in this situation for the first time, because it simply  explains a workable methodology for getting organized, identifying the  issues, solving the problem, getting consensus and going on to implement  successfully.  A lot of this will be intuitive, but what is not intuitive  is what will help you.  You can probably best use this as a checklist to be  sure you are not skipping steps.  If you buy this book to be your own  consultant expecting to get McKinsey-like results, you will probably not  succeed.  Drawing on lots of experience, skill, and smart people allows  McKinsey to use this kind of methodology for best results.  But you will  certainly get better results than if you ignore the methodology, and few  can afford McKinsey.  Professional firms in other fields (such as  accountants and lawyers) would do well to review this book to create a  sense of urgency about having a methodology.  My main regret is that the  book is authored by someone who was an associate for three years rather  than one of the firm's all-stars.  Perhaps another McKinsey alum will be  encouraged to share her or his views of the firm's approach.  That would be  nice for us all.",230,0
Kindle_Store,B000FA5KX2,5.0,positive,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable read, especially for a business book.  It's length is perfect for today's managers.  At 178 pages, it can be consumed on a round-trip flight.  More importantly, the book contains many practical  concepts that can be applied to any problem encountered in business. Rasiel  opens the book by providing insight into the methodologies and processes  employed by McKinsey & Co.  Because of the secretive culture of the  world's most elite managment consulting firms, Rasiel shares the basics of  how the most brilliant problem-solvers at McKinsey approach issues, and  shows how the reader can apply the same steps at his or her own  organization. The book also contains many business lessons learned by many  McKinsey-ites that again can be used by all.  Whether you hire  consultants, aspire to be a consultant, or just want to sharpen your  business knowledge and problem-solving skills, The McKinsey Way is for you.  As practical as any business book ever read by this individual (and I have  used many over the years to combat insomnia), the book is sure to remain  close to your desk as one you frequently refer to again and again.",192,1

Reader beware: this book was written in 1999. Methodologies and tools have changed dramatically and I do not believe there has been any revisions/new editions.

I read this book because I'm interested in management consulting and wanted an insider's perspective without a Hollywood filter.

The author never addresses why he only spent 3 years at McKinsey and he clearly ran out of ""insights"" after the first couple of chapters.

Nothing would be lost if this piece of writing was condensed to be a chapter in a career pathways pamphlet for high school students rather than a book. The author seems to think that the reader should care that his favourite late night snack is sushi; or that after consulting with many McKinsey alumni, he discovered that people who travel should pack spare clothes; or that McKinsey employees research using the internet.

This book contains 3-5 interesting insights amongst a sea of white space, common sense, and mentions that consultants work long hours. I'll finish with a verbatim example:

""Typically, a McKinsey team blocks out two hours, if not more, for a brainstorming session. Some team leaders prefer weekends for their meetings, though this is not always looked on favourably by the other members of the team. These sessions often run well into the night, fuelled by deliveries of pizza, Chinese food, or sushi (my personal favourite).""",222,16

Instead of providing a detailed perspective on methods and approach, we get some laughable frameworks that put everything in perspective: Case in point -- Raisel notes that McKinsey recommendations are 'fact based.' Wow, what a revelation -- I'm sure that opens everyone's eyes! He spends the early part of the 'book' (that is a generous term here, the text might fill a 50 page deliverable, at best) discussing the importance of hypothesis development and issue trees. All fine, except this is consulting 101 -- every consultant gathers initial facts, develops potential rationales for the issues a client might face (or an hypothesis), then goes off to see if their thoughts are correct, and finally develops go-forward recommendations.

Raisel stays at such a high level throughout the book, that there is no way to get beyond the pleasantries of 'base your conclusions on facts,' and 'adjust your hypothesis based on new facts.' Instead, he sounds like a washed up high school athlete most of the time -- recounting war stories, eating chinese food at the office, and working until 2am every night! This all gets old pretty quick, though he tops it off with chapters on how to travel (bring a sweater for long flights!) and how it's a good idea to carry on your luggage to save time at the airport.

I really don't see how this book stays in print, but I do understand how Raisel only lasted 3 years at McKinsey -- this sort of supercial blather is just the sort of thing that McKinsey despises.",304,32

Anyone who has been in consulting for even a couple years can tell this is rudimentary and no-brainer type stuff.
The level of depth this author goes into is pretty pathetic in my opinion.  And I guess no wonder, the guy only worked there for 3 years.  McKinsey has been around for eons and this guy thinks he has the secret sauce after working there for just 3 years?  Which also means he was probably at best an analyst or an associate (the lower 2 levels).

It's probably not advice you couldn't get elsewhere, but the writing style of the author makes it very enjoyable to read and I think even simple messages deserve repeating.  I particularly enjoyed the stories from actual experiences at the firm.  I found them fascinating.

Quite a few people have nitpicked the book with negative reviews.  My opinion is that they either don't have a sense of humor (and missed the jokes) or they are probably already above average consultants and therefore weren't the target audience.

If you're not an experienced consultant, or if you're an average one, then this book could teach you a few things that make it well worth the price of the book.

Individuals should also benefit from the tips and techniques for effectively working and surviving in a highly pressurised working environment.

In summary: it's worth reading, but take note that the author only spent 3 years at McKinsey and, based on an average engagement length of 6 months, that means about 6 engagements (assuming one engagement at a time).

The book may be interesting for someone who would like to get a romanticized version of what it is like to be a respected consultant, but that's probably it- the book is more of a feel-good rahrah than anything truly unique and inspiring.  It seems as though Rasiel wants us to believe that McKinsey was the first to use the scientific method and engage in creative thinking... his examples leave me dissatisfied and are too general- in the end it sounds like he is sitting for an interview rather than exposing the secrets behind a well-respected company (then again, maybe he is looking for a job now?!).

It covers most important concepts and approaches on 1) how to frame problems 2) how to organise and run a project 3) how to present outcomes of a project and 4) how to work as a consultant in McKinsey.

As mr Rasiel goes through the elements of consulting, he unfortunately does not go in much depth. For example, he talks about running a project in specific phases, but does not explain elements such as workplanning, types of analysis or scope management in any depth. He basically mentions them as important. A key element that I believe is missing from the book is the concept of feedback and performance discussions. Consulting can offer the excellent learning exactly because it offers raw, data-driven and honest feedback. You will hear from your managers things you may not want, but may well need to hear. It is my belief McKinsey has more to offer than what mr Rasiel describes.

Furthermore, the tone that mr Rasiel strikes may put some clients and even (potential) employees off. The feeling I got as I was reading the book was that senior clients are often considered difficult in their demands and client team members more often than not a pain to work with.

Furthermore, the book is full of generalities, for example, the chapter on interviewing for facts was nice, but again, nothing special. You would be far better off buying specialty books on such matters. I think this would be a good book to buy if you want to enter into consulting or are looking to work for McKinsey.

At the very least, you are supposed to have gained general problem solving skills. This book titled 'The McKinsey Way' is actually nothing but a systematic approach to managing the most common problems you will run into while working in Corporate America. These are the tested and proven success techniques that have worked for the consultants at McKinsey explained in very simplistic terms.
If you have a college degree, the chances are that you are already aware and exposed to a lot of these techniques. Nevertheless, it is definitely worthwhile spending a few dollars to own a copy of this book. The observations made in this book are those that are universal and don't necessarily change with time. So, the benefits of reading this book and applying these techniques can be very long lasting.
The author's writing style makes it very easy to read and understand the different topics presented in the book. The chapters can be read independently and so can the different sections in each chapter. Hence, you can read the book a few pages at a time and still benefit tremendously.
You can start applying these techniques right away so the benefits of reading this book can be seen immediately. It may be hard to believe that McKinsey is known to charge up to $800/hour for just doing these simple things but they do accomplish valuable results. And that's why corporations are willing to pay such a high price for McKinsey's consultants.

Additionally, as a consultant who didn't travel or work very much at client sites, Rasiel couldn't give a complete picture of the consulting lifestyle.

gather information, motivate teams, think proactively, market services and ensure customer satisfaction.  Although many of the ideas are common sense, I recommend this book strongly for people who are paid to solve problems.  Some highlights:
1) After gathering the relevant facts, segregate the issues so they are MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive).  This will help make sense of the chaotic data and help clarify the problem.  (pg 10)  In fact, sometimes the problem that the client brings you is not even the real problem.
2) Use hypotheses and analysis frameworks (Porter's five forces etc...) but do not fall in love with your original hypothesis.
3) Consulting work is not in a vacuum.  Be aware of the internal politics and remember that a good recommendation is one that can realistically be implemented.
4) To increase the customer's ROI, focus on the main problems (80/20 principle) and stop analyzing when you have the answer or you see diminishing marginal returns.  As the author quaintly put it, ""Don't boil the ocean."" (pg 32)

Therefore, when a book appears which purports to explain the ""way"" of the most prestigious management consultant firm, it is certain to attract a great deal of attention and this one did. Having been involved in a number of strategic alliances over the years, ones which also involved McKinsey executives, I really expected much more from this book than it does in fact deliver. (I have the same opinion of its sequel, The McKinsey Mind, which I do not intend to review.) I recall a period years ago when the Boston Celtics were consistently winning NBA championships. At the annual All-Star game, the East squad ran Celtic plays because they were the only plays everyone knew. Lombardi's Green Bay Packer teams ran the same offense and defense season after season while winning NFL titles. What's my point? Perhaps what differentiates McKinsey from all other major management consulting firms. (whatever that ""what"" or ""way"" is) cannot be explained in a book and will only be revealed over time in direct and frequent contact with McKinsey executives.

The author demonstrates this chestnut with a book that is 20% useful and fresh and 80% no-brainer advice and shameless McKinsey advertising (we are CONSTANTLY reminded of how smart and ethical all those McKinsey consultants are; all consulting anecdotes have happy endings - unless the client screwed up; real quotes: ""As any good McKinsey associate would, this young man applied himself tirelessly and diligently to his task"", or ""Hank knew his area of the bank inside and out and was probably as smart as any member of the McKinsey team""... high praise indeed.) McKinsey's approving editors have all the subtly of China's Xinhua propaganda agency. Trouble is: many of us know people at McKinsey...

I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to the game of management consulting. The advice here is clear, comprehensive and concise.
Moreover, I would especially recommend this excellent tome to seasoned consultants who might believe that they know it all - it no longer amazes me to find some senior consultants who either never had the first idea about some of the basic essentials or who who have become complacent and lazy over the years.
Finally, I would recommend this book to anyone in business who uses management consultants in a serious way - other than to massage ones ego - this book should give you an indication of at least the levels of rigor and professionalism to expect for your money.
So a great insightful, knowledgeable and clear overview for the novice, an excellent set of key reminders for the seasoned professional and a useful, concise and simple benchmark for the clients of management consultants.

Some complaints.
* My recent Sunday edition did not include my beloved Arts & Entertainment section.
* Too many missing articles compared to the paper/digital edition
* Photos have only a remote relationship to the article. And, many times, the photo captions include editorial notes not intended for publication.
* Why not publish the comics as individualized selections. For example, I love Family Circus, Peanuts and Dennis the Menace. There should be a way to select which comics to display.

Kindle_Store,B000UELR1M,2.0,negative,"Up until about 3-4 months ago, I was happy with the Kindle version of the PI. Unfortunately, they have started having rendering problems. Many photos are very blurry. There's no consistency or way of predicting which pictures will be blurry. Some tagging content appears. In fact, I've even seen staff or stringer phone numbers appear in print.

Second defect concerns their Bridge column. They do not print an illustration showing the hands. There's absolutely no value in the text content without the hands, and vice versa.

In either case, I'd be happy if they either fix the problem or drop the content.

Despite TWO separate attempts to get these problems addressed, I've failed miserably. The last was a phone call to somebody at digital edition who was TOTALLY CLUELESS. She kept asking how I download the Inquirer. She didn't seem to realize it was an automatic download, despite my attempts in describing how the paper downloads itself each day.

The second was thorugh email. The guy responding tried to sell me on buying an iPad and subscribing to their other digital edition.  This was particularly annoying. If somethings broken, why are you trying to sell me on buying something else?

I'm not sure what happened, but I'm disappointed.  Especially by their customer service and an attitude that communicated very clearly that they didn't care if my problem was solved or not.

In terms of other aspects:

- Wonderful interface for navigating; well organized!
- The writing is excellent
- Sometimes articles repeat in the Sunday edition, but I suppose that's okay

I was not a subscriber to the paper before, but I did read it on occasion. I was worried from reading some of the other reviews that the paper would be often late, but it has yet to arrive late for me in the past two weeks. Maybe they worked out the issue. Its always delivered to my kindle before I set off for work, which is perfect because I don't have the 3G kindle.

The content is great and includes most of the paper version. Its only missing a few things like the comics and classifieds, but I don't miss that at all. At first I didn't love the format of the paper on the kindle, but now that im used to it, I can navigate quickly and easily. I love the regional section. Everyday I find something that makes me like reading the paper more and more. As a former metro reader, the Inquirer is (clearly) much better.

I also love the convenience of reading the paper on my kindle during morning commute. It could not be easier, and I have to laugh to myself when I see passengers wrestling with folding and reading a newspaper on a packed standing-room-only bus/subway/trolley. I love that I can read it with one hand while I stand and hold the grab bars with the other. Additionally, I like that theres no ""paper"" being used once and thrown away.

(I have tried some other papers and their formatting is not as reader friendly nor their content worth the cost to me.)  One caveat is that I am local and have been a PI reader off and on for decades so I am use to the style of writing and have interest in the news of the area.",112,70

Otherwise, when it is timely, it is easy to navigate and contains all articles.  I do wish it had the boxscores in the sports section and other ""box"" type materila, like the point sreads and such, but otherwise, a very nice edition.",98,72
Kindle_Store,B000UELR1M,4.0,positive,"I've been subscribed for about 4 days now, and I think I'll keep this one.  The formatting is great, with little to no issues (aside from the occasional caption to a non-existent picture showing up), and it arrives on time (5-6 AM for me).

An additional plus to this Kindle edition is that it appears that graphic fluff (crosswords, comics) are the only things that have been removed.  All of the news articles, no matter how minor, as well as commentary, editorials, and similar content appear to have survived intact.

With that said, I find the choice(s) of what picture(s) are included to be rather random.  I've never seen a front page picture on the Kindle yet.  There seems to always be one picture included per day, and it's typically in the entertainment/living section and has little importance.  One day it was a picture from ""Watchmen"" which was included with the review, and on another it was a random picture of a lodge that corresponded to a personal story that I didn't bother reading.

I don't know if these are just odd things that slip through the cracks (because I don't remember seeing a picture in the paper today), but I'd much rather have the front page photo if they're going to include any pictures.  The Kindle is plenty capable of rendering these.

At any rate, this gripe is minor and doesn't impact my enjoyment of the paper, and I will continue my subscription.  I would recommend this newspaper to others in the PA/NJ/NY area as it's more polished, complete, and significantly more reasonably priced than the alternatives.",268,73

Kindle_Store,B000UELR1M,4.0,positive,"I've been buying individual issues of the Sunday Philadelphia Inquirer on my Kindle pretty much every week since purchasing the device.  For about a third of the cost of the print edition, I get all the news, features, and columns everyone else does, and many of the photographs.  And the things I don't get- cluttery ad inserts, classifieds, ink-stained fingers, etc.- I don't want anyway.

The Kindle edition of the paper, like most Kindle periodicals, is well organized and easy to navigate, allowing me to quickly jump to favorites like Lisa Scottoline's Sunday ""Chick Wit"" column and the book reviews.

There's some criticism here in Philadelphia that, due to budget and staff cuts, the Inquirer isn't what it used to be.  That may be so, but there's still a lot of lively writing in the paper, especially on Sunday.  And buying the Sunday paper in about nine seconds (just after I put the coffee on), and for about fifty cents, deflates the criticisms somewhat.

The monthly subscription, which gets you the paper every day, is a great deal, too.  But I'm glad Amazon also allows the purchase of individual issues of its Kindle newspapers, giving those of us who only prefer an occasional dose of a particular newspaper a chance to play in the sandbox, too.

I have a number of favorite quotes from all eras, depending on my situation and needs, but I found only one of them here and it was only one sentence - the problem: the quote really isn't relevant without hearing or reading the entire offering of about a dozen lines.

One other problem: these quotations should be organized by relevance, what the reader needs - grief support, inspiration, losing, humility, honor, character development, importance of honesty, etc.

Sorry I couldn't recommend this book, especially since someone went to a good deal of effort to assemble this compendium of quotations.

Familiar Quotations is a delightful reference book.  Filled with things, I think I have heard before, things I know I have heard before, and things I have never heard before.  I find much that I wish I had heard before.  Some take little effort to understand, others I think I understand, some require mental exertion to understand, but all are worthy of understanding.

The layered story finely balances a tale of intrigue and horror in 1912 with a story of science fiction and suspense in 2012.  It takes a great Author to write one good book once in a while in one genre, but it takes sheer genius to write 2 books, in 2 different time periods, with 2 different genres and have it all work together as one mind-blowing book.

After reading Children of Salem, I didn't think Walker could ever top that tale for intrigue or suspense, but once again he has proven me wrong.  This author has done what seemed to be impossible; he has written a book that really does have it all.  If you don't read this book you are definitely selling yourself short.

Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,4.0,positive,"Titanic 2012:  Curse of RMS Titanic, is an unusual book. It fits into both historical fiction and futuristic fiction. Walker writes both aspects quite well. The book takes history for a spin. We all know what happened to the Titanic in the end, but do we truly know what was going on in the minds of those on-board? Of course not, because we can't know-and the premise that there was a curse of a sort takes us on an unusual journey.

This was actually my introduction to Alastair Ransom-and I liked him. In fact, I found myself liking the characters from the past more than the characters from 2012. This may be because of all the accurate history that was the backdrop for this story. Or it may be that the characters have been in Walker's head for a longer period of time and were more three dimensional. It could also be that I didn't understand some of the futuristic science as well.

At any rate, I read the book in about a day and a half. It was the kind of book that I didn't want to put down after I started. Even knowing Titanic's ultimate end, the book was suspenseful for me. And I found the ending for the book and particularly for the 2012 crew to be satisfying.",221,3

Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,1.0,negative,"I'm fascinated with all things Titanic.  I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't.

For the one thing, I think the book needed a good editor.  Even better, spell check.  There were obvious typos that running spell check would have caught.  There were parts of the book inserted into other parts that made no sense. For example, when the main character was on the bridge, talking to the captain, there's suddenly a dialogue of several paragraphs long with a female character, when the two men were the only ones in the map room.  For another, the characters were hard to tell apart.  They're introduced by name, dropped in with little to no description, and none of them stood out for me. I can't even remember the names and I just finished reading less than an hour ago.

I scrapbook. I take my family photos and put them on a page with elements and journaling that tell the story of what happened on that particular occasion.  I don't always scrapbook all the photos from a given day at the same time. I might return to it months later.  The first time I had my finished product printed, I discovered that I often told the same story page after page, because I didn't create them at the same time.  I've learned, before printing, to check for duplication, flow and continuity. This book didn't have that.  We were told the same things over and over, often a few paragraphs apart.  We were told thing in dialogue rather than shown them in description.

I didn't ""feel"" like I was there. I didn't care for the characters. I didn't feel anything other than boredom while reading this book",285,5
Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,2.0,negative,"I really did. The story premise is good and I like the split narrative between 1912 and 2012. The technology the author introduces stretches credulity a bit, but I can live with that just fine; the book is fiction trending toward science fiction after all.

All of the good ideas are wiped away by one key failing as far as I can tell: no editor. Or, if an editor was used that person was, well, not very good. A good editor could have easily cut 20,000 or more words out of the book and it would have been much better for it. An editor would, I hope, have caught a mistake like this from a scene where characters in 1912 are discussing armaments available to them on the Titanic:

""I want one of those!"" probably have had some Lee Enfield MKIII Short Rifles on board for close confines of ship. It was in .303 British caliber a pretty potent round up to 300 yards. You can probably google those weapons if you need more particulars.
""If I thought it would do any good other than getting more men killed than these disgusting creatures"", Murdoch replied, ""I'd break into the Vickers machine guns on board.""

The author's note to himself to do a little more research on SMLE rifles finds its way into the final text.

There are many other examples similar to this one throughout the book. Not author notes appearing, but problems that never would have been had a good editor been used.

The author came up with what I think was a very good idea for a story with a different take on the Titanic disaster and it could have been epic. But the editorial mistakes really distract from any tension that the story might otherwise create.",299,6

It takes a lot of time for the book to pick up, but it plateaus fairly quickly and at a low level - the grammatical and formatting errors kept me from getting immersed in the story.

Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,1.0,negative,"This book has an interesting premise and the writing itself is actually quite readable. However, this otherwise interesting story is plagued by remarkably poor editing.  In one scene a character uses the name of a character they have just met and not been introduced to yet, and in the next paragraph that character finally introduces himself. In numerous places sentences, sentence fragments, and paragraphs are repeated.

It also appears that the author's or editor's notes have been left in the text such as in one of the 1912 scenes when one character is admiring the weapon of another character the text recommends ""if you want to know more about these weapons"" to ""google"" them. It is not within quotations so it doesn't appear that it was meant to be said by the character in 1912, which would be a whole other issue entirely.... and the tone in which it seems to address the reader is completely out of place to how the rest of the story is written.

Okay, now that I have that out of the way, here is why I didn't finish this book. I have had a lifetime obsession with the Titanic and all things relating to the historical facts of the sinking. This book, although I knew it was fiction, sounded too good to pass up. This is a VERY LONG book and I was looking forward to settling in for a long read full of Titanic-themed entertainment. I have seen that quite a few other reviewers have already commented on the grammatical errors, so I will not go into specifics.

This book seemed like with a good line edit, historical fact correcting and a little polish it might have been an excellent read. What I felt I got when I started reading this book, was a first draft. The sentence structure was clunky and distracting and the dialogue was some of the hardest to digest I have ever seen. When you combine those things with the amazingly bad research errors on dates, times and historical fact in general, I couldn't do it. I did laugh, I did cry, but not for the reasons I was probably supposed to. I try to finish everything I start, but on this one I had to jump ship for self-preservation.",235,15
Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,3.0,neutral,"As many have said, the main problem about this book is the writing and editing. The poor grammar, confusing and repeating dialog, inaccurate historical facts and the infamous 1912 google all make reading it a pain. Even (or especially) for me whose mother tongue isn't English. I pretty much had to re-write the book in my mind as I read.

Having said that, I did finish the book. The story concept is interesting and has its attractiveness. The interaction between characters are well developed. And I don't have problem with (and actually like) jumping between timelines. Probably not for everyone, but I read books for context more than for the writing.

Here is a few comments that I haven't seen covered by others:
- The jumping between timelines could be done better. Often information is revealed in one timeline too soon)
- Comparing to the overall lengthy book, the ending is too short (in 1912 from the iceberg strike, in 2012 from the entering the freezer). If nothing more can fit in there, perhaps the book can be shorten a bit.
- I wouldn't mind a bit more follow up on the Afterward section. Especially after 1912 timeline. Tell us something about Thomas and Lightoller, whatever. That could probably link the two timelines better and be a better conclusion of the book.",222,16

Walker has a lengthy aknowledgement page in which he profusely thanks his editors and pre readers. Why is it none of these people find it odd that NONE of his ""facts"" are accurate? In the first chapter alone he innacurately states that the Brittanic was launched BEFORE Titanic. Brittanic was not launched until August 6th 1929 and made her maiden voyage on June 28th 1930. he refers to the Olympic as ""the last Titanic"" when in fact she was the first of the three massive ships. The date he used for Chapter 1 is April 3, 1912, and his characters state that the Titanic ""is almost finished"" except that Titanic was launched May 31st 1911 and was finally completed on April 2nd 1912. He incorrectly states that 1600 died aboard when in fact it was little over 1500. it was hard to read a book where the author took no time whatsoever to research the subject matter, and his crackerjack staff didn't bother to correct his inaccuracies either. Yes, its a work of fiction, an ""altered History"" if you will but at least get the bare bones facts straight before trying to build a story around them.

Not wanting to give away the story, at this moment in history we are delving into unknown regions of the world due to the results of global warming - the melting ice caps and much more.

It is not the best book ever written, but it was a decent story that was enjoyable to read.  Yes, there are typos, missing words, lack of editing, etc. but it was still fun to read.

I guess I just did not like being left wondering where it came from.  Why, after the first couple of people, you never really got to get back into its thoughts?  You never saw things from its perspective again.

Other than that, I liked this book.  I loved Declan, Thomas, and Alastair.  The three musketeers is right.  Men brought together under bizarre, horrific circumstances who rise above and choose to do the right thing.  Giving everything for those who will never know or appreciate it.  I would like to think I was that kind of person, but you never know until you are there.

I love the description of the Titanic and the timeline Declan kept from its inception to its last moments.  The Titanic has such wonderful mystery surrounding it.  I loved how the author took that mystery and added the scifi to it.  Giving it a different twist.

Making you think, what if...  What if there really was another reason it hit that iceberg and sank.  I love stories that make me think and want to know more about what is in them.  I fully intend to research more on the Titanic, her officers, and those that were on board 100 years ago.

I would recommend this book to anyone with a love of history, the Titanic, and scifi.",242,48

But Walker really stumbles with some of the conversation---and there is A LOT of conversation in this book.  The characters often say things that just seem incredibly out of place in order to give the reader context that could perhaps be better done with narrative. Unfortunately this gets a bit annoying after awhile.  That said, it is every bit worth $.99 to read. I very much enjoyed the story, and I'm trying not to compare it to a book with a large publishing house editor behind it to catch typos and grammatical errors and stilted conversations. I don't think it's fair to do so. But I do wish someone with a sharper pencil had taken a second glance.",144,49

I loved the 3 previous Ransom books this author wrote, and would give them each five stars, but this work was such drivel that I am amazed it was by the same author.

The story constantly bounces back and fourth between 1912 and 2012 telling two different stories revolving around the same central idea: That secretly, Titanic was sabatoged and deliberatley sank with the intended loss of ALL on board. This thriller lets you read along as the 1912 team tries to resolve the mystery and prevent the tragedy while the 2012 team races to discover the cause and their own resolution to the problem. Bottom line, it puts a whole new spin on the sad tale of Titanic... and it will probably get you off Beef Jerkey for life!

There are some mixed reviews on this book. Yes, there were things in there I think an editor should have caught, but in the big picture of things, we are talking about some minor technical aspect of the writing/editing process. But I can't ding the fastest race car at the track because of a couple bubbles in the paint job. The story is everything and this story is a benchmark thriller.

Sadly, I had the bad guy figured out 1/3 of the way in. Still, the author left some surprises in store for me. Especially the ending.
The middle part of the book seemed to drag a bit, too much repeating the same thing over and over.
The scientists are the best trained in the world, yet on their first deep dive, they throw out all the safety rules. Hmmmmmmm, no.

I still think it's a great plot, but the actual book...not so much, because I found it almost unreadable. It's just not written well, and for that reason I was never able to lose myself in the story. Instead, it felt like I should be sitting there with a red editing pen to mark up the incomplete and run-on sentences; mismatched tenses; stilted dialogue; poorly placed punctuation; misused subject/object; and, my personal pet peeve, overuse of exclamation points, which made me feel like I was reading a Judge Parker comic.

I only made it one-third of the way through this book. I'd love to actually finish it someday if the author submits it to a rigorous editing process and offers a revised version. As it is, though, I just couldn't stick with it long enough to find out how the story ends. I kept having to reread sentences and paragraphs to try to decipher exactly what was being said, and that's just no fun.",183,57

This is a must read for Titanic buffs and anyone who would like a quick history on what happened that fateful night. The premise concerning the reason for the sinking is certainly new and intriguing.

Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,5.0,positive,"I purchased this for my Kindle as I saw that it involved Alastair Ransom and I am a fan of Walker's Ransom tales and how he paints Chicago of that era.  This book continues his great storytelling style.  Fans of Ransom will love the Ransom action and how the author describes a 1912 Belfast.  I also enjoyed Walker's detailed descriptions of Titanic herself.

The book switches from two stories.  The first, set in 1912, which leads up to the eventual demise of the Titanic, and a 2012 storyline of a group of divers attempting a visit to the wreck to secure the treasure of Titanic.

While 100 years apart, the stories have a central element that builds within each one of them.  Walker does a fantastic job in both stories and also in switching between them through the book.  The book has the feel of a good early 20th century detective story, a great alternate history, and has a touch of sci fi built into it as well.  Well worth a read.",172,59

The first takes place in 1912, in Belfast, Ireland and during the birth and launch of the Titanic on its first and only voyage towards North America.  The second story takes place a century later as a salvage ship uses advanced dive equipment to get to Titanic as it rests two miles below the surface of the Atlantic.  These two stories are tied to each other by a journal...and something else.

If you know the name Dirk Pitt, and understand the acronym NUMA, then you'll love Titanic 2012.  Lots of action.  Lots of suspense.  And while it's a fictional story, there's lots of historical information that adds considerably to the realism of this masterpiece.",120,62

Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,5.0,positive,"Once again Robert Walker has penned a novel that defies categorization. In ""Titanic 2012"" he skillfully mixes historical, mystery, horror, and science fiction in a blend with enough depth to satisfy the hard core aficionado of any of these genres. Mr. Walker skillfully interweaves the early twentieth century perceptions of Alastair Ransom, his recurring, irascible, hard bitten detective, with those of David Ingles, a member of a dive team of tomorrow attempting to salvage artifacts from the Titanic. The mystery and suspense build from page one as the two are led to the same inescapable conclusion, that there is more to the sinking of the ""unsinkable"" Titanic than is told in the press and history books. It is obvious that the author spent numerous hours researching the life and culture of 1912 Ireland, the construction, layout, operation, and timeline of the Titanic, and the cutting edge technology that would enable salvaging a ship beneath two and half miles of ocean. That vast knowledge provides a solid basis for his unique and provocative theory of why and how the Titanic met its end.

This book is best read on a quiet evening, snuggled in a comfortable chair, in front of a crackling fireplace. However, it would be advised to have a dog at your feet to assure you that the chills racing along your spine are only from the book. If you have purchased this novel to read on a cruise ship crossing the North Atlantic, you might consider waiting until after you arrive before starting it.",256,64
Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,5.0,positive,"Robert Walker once again takes us on the ride of our life in Titanic 1912-2012. Every page holds a backdrop to the suspense and horror that might be released again.
He switches between time periods with the ease of a master, never failing to remember where he left us when he takes us back and forward in time. All the while continuing to amaze and keep us spell bound waiting for the next sentence, the next chapter.
This book is a visual masterpiece that leaves your imagination open to placing yourself inside the hearts and minds of the characters. Whether it is Ingles, Kelly, Alsastair, Declan or any other of the numerous characters you can feel, see and hear what they are thinking and feeling as if in truth you had intimate knowledge of them as people.
By not really describing the creature in full detail it actually helps us know the confusion and disbelief of all those who come in contact with it.

Titanic 2012 is one of those books/stories that says with you. While there were some initial glitches/errors in the text, the gracious Rob Walker and his team worked diligently to update and re-release the book. I'm glad 'cause the reading the Titanic 2012 (Curse of RMS Titanic - an Inspector Alastair Ransom title) was a heck of voyage. Highly recommended!",89,67
Kindle_Store,B0049U4CCE,5.0,positive,"First off, the genre. The author himself describes this book as a ""paranormal generational historical novel of intrigue, suspense, and horror,"" which covers a lot of bases, but I would add one more: mystery.

Walker starts with the premise that Captain Edward J. Smith scuttled his own ship, thereby sinking the unsinkable. But why?

Jump ahead a hundred years. A dive team, on the centennial anniversary of the day the Titanic sunk, sets their sights on plundering the rumored myriad riches lying on the bottom in water so deep that up until now, divers couldn't possibly leave a sub to pick off treasure. Armed with technology allowing humans to literally breathe like fish underwater, the team of treasure hunters are about to learn a horrific secret that not only took the Titanic down, but threatens the future of humanity on earth.

Walker has taken the historical mysteries surrounding the sinking of such a spectacular ship on her maiden voyage, and weaves a riveting tale that lives up to its billing of intrigue, suspense and horror.

Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,4.0,positive,"Having read a number of Chris Pettersen's books, including the superb Tear in Time, having spotted this story, I couldn't resist reading it.

The author's writing style is both accessible and engaging.  Whilst up beat, the tension is there when you want it and he always makes you wonder about what is going to happen next.

The story of a young man in search of adventure, is one that is not uncommon.  However, the author has made this one particularly engaging, by combining mountain climbing with aeronautics.  There is a good deal of technical detail in this book that covers both the flying and climbing aspects of the story.  Whilst I know something about flying light aircraft, I'm less knowledgeable of the technicalities of mountain climbing, so I was pleased with the descriptions  of the techniques and equipment used, which were helpful without being tedious.

The story moves along well and this really is a book in three parts:  the journey to the mountain, the climb and the return home.  There are times when you are carried along with the hero as he battles to keep his plane in the air and also when he is climbing.  The author successfully manages to convey the feeling of claustrophobia caused by flying in mountain passes and the heights of the glaciers.

If I have a criticism of this book, is that it ends at 65% with the rest of the volume being taken up by the first chapters of Tear in Time.

There were very few typographic errors in this book, always good to see from an Indie writer.",267,0
Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,4.0,positive,"This book surprised me with its grasp of mountain climbing and airplane flight. It also contains a healthy amount of information about various locations in the world. And all of this was woven into a very entertaining, sometimes tense, story. Very well written! The book tells the tale of Jack who wants to climb a mountain that has not been climbed before. Why? Because it's inaccessible except by plane.
There were points in the story where my body actually tensed and I found myself reading faster to see if Jack would survive. That's a good book! Although Jack is barely an adult, he builds the type of plane he needs to pursue his dream. Then he takes it on a long solo flight through many countries. Though he has very little money and subsists largely on peanut butter sandwiches, Jack challenges his skills and endurance, pitting himself against a remote snowy mountain. He has a number of close calls that will give the reader tingly worrisome feelings in the pit of the stomach (or bottoms of the feet, if you fear heights).

Kindle_Store,B004SPEKKO,5.0,positive,"I read ""Hidden Courage"" before the other 2 books in the Atlantis series because it gives a solid background as to the main character of all 3 books. By the time you get through the first few pages of the book, you start to get a solid grasp as to who this adventurer really is, how he thinks, and how he will react to stress situations.

It was easy for me to form mental pictures of what Chris was writing about because he was able to describe, in detail, everything that our hero, Jack, saw and did. As one commentator wrote, I found myself reading faster when I got to a particularly exciting part, just so I could see how it turned out and if Jack made it back in one piece. Fortunately, Jack does prevail, and gets back home to the loving arms of his parents.

Now I am involved in the second book in the series, ""Tomb of Atlantis"". I'll not get into any particulars about this book, other than to say that in ""Tomb"", Jack gets into a much more harrowing situation than he did in ""Hidden Courage"".

There are typos and misprints in the book, but not that bad (especially when comparing to some of the MS press stuff).

The main character, Kate Carpenter, is a person with whom you can identify.  As a front of the house manager of a large theatre her life proceeds normally until a dead body turns up during a show.  And then, like any great mystery novel, though the premise would never happen in real life, the heroine does not hesitate to jump in with both feet to investigate but you never doubt her ability to solve the crime.
From the beginning, when the dead body is found, to the conclusion I couldn't put it down.  House Report is a real page-turner and an excellent read.",152,6
Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,"This could have been a great book.  The author is obviously talented and knowledgeable about the theater; however, the main character is annoying, spoiled, shallow, and stupid.

If you honestly believed there was any chance at all that your boyfriend could be a murderer, would you ask him to move in with you? Kate did.

If you were being stalked and had been repeatedly attacked and threatened, would you continue wandering off on your own without telling anyone where you were going even though you have police officers assigned to protect you? Kate did.

If you were trying to find a killer and managed to scratch his face during one of his attacks, would you wash your hands rather than let the police gather the evidence?  Kate did.

If you received a death threat, would you touch it with your hands and then hand it to 2 other people before the police arrived, ensuring that any fingerprints would be gone?  Kate did.

She gives her assistant all the jobs she personally doesn't like, rather than splitting the duties equally or allowing him to learn how to do the job fully. She's very spoiled when it comes to men, expecting her boyfriend to cook for her and wait on her and give her rides everywhere (why doesn't she have a car at 33 years old?).  She's selfish in her friendships and condescending to her coworkers. I really couldn't stand her.

Some of the minor characters were entertaining and not so self-absorbed.  I liked Scott immensely and Nick as well.  The police were very unrealistic, rarely bothering to look for any evidence at all.

There is a little humor, and there are a few sweet moments, but I'm not inclined to seek out anything else by this author.",296,7

When a man is found murdered in Kate's part of the theater complex, Kate does everything she possibly can to make herself the next victim.  She seems to do everything possible to alienate her boyfriend, her friends, and her acquaintances, and practically invites the killer to harass her.

I don't care how the author tried to explain it...this guy is a total loser!  Given this, I could not buy into their romance. *END SPOILER* Kate herself was an annoying character.  She carelessly puts herself into one dangerous situation after the next and then is shocked when bad things happen to her.  The investigator on the case could not have been more ineffectual, basically allowing Kate to interfere in everyway including antagonizing the suspects and causing her coworker to end up in the hospital.  I definitely cannot recommend this book!",159,22

My only complaint was the depiction of a character who had ""gotten God."" It seemed a bit one-sided. I'm not sure if she was depicting a cult or just an average church-goer in her description.

When it turned out to be someone unimportant for a ridiculous reason I was very disappointed. Spoiler ahead: A great ending would have been Cam as the killer and her winding up with Scott.,98,32
Kindle_Store,B0055MJ74S,2.0,negative,"While this book was not a total waste, it left a lot to be desired.  This story could have been told in at least 100 fewer pages.  The monotonous repetition about Kate drinking coffee and smoking was truly annoying.
This author would do well to study techniques in how to construct a good first person narrative.  At one point I started counting the times she used the pronoun 'I' and there were at least 8 on all the pages I counted.  ""I went and took a bath.""  ""I made my 87th pot of coffee.""  ""I need a cigarette."" ""I think my boyfriend is a murderer.""  It was enough to make me want to scream.
All in all, it was just a little too 'cutsie, wootsie' for my taste.  I'm not at all sold on this lazy, coffee swilling, chain smoking, no common sense having character being so beloved by her staff.  I think this is a fantasy indulgence by the author of perhaps how she wished her theater experience had played out.

The fact that there are more books that revolve around this character is also mind numbing.  I can't imagine having to slog my way through more than one.",200,33

But the plot was not too bad it just wasn't developed and supported fully by the story.  I will list some of the shortcomings I found:  The writing seems too abrupt.  Not enough character development.  Switches from scene to seen too abruptly.  The ending was very short.  Should be lengthened.  Factual errors in the book.  Technical things were often passed over quickly and could use more development.  Not like the over-depth that Clancy goes into but more.  Russian defenses were minimized.  Sub went too close to shore.  Captain left the bridge while they were in enemy waters.  Little things perhaps but the idea of a military fiction book is to simulate reality not fully re-write it.

I did not dislike this book.  It was an ""ok"" read just not polished and it could of been so much more.  Put this book next to one from the best selling authors and make a list of improvements for the next book.  I think the author has promise just needs to write less abruptly (and perhaps less hurriedly) and to work on his writing style, character development, etc.  I think/hope that he writes again.  I think that it will be better and that he can eventually reach a steady 4.5 star rating on future books if he puts the time and effort in.",252,9

Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,"Short story.  Not as ""crazy"" as the title suggests.  Author attempts to be self depricating and humorous but it falls flat.  Would not recommend.",24,31
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,"Some ""war stories"" from the dating frontier. The author has an enjoyable, familiar writing voice and it's fun to hear him give the lowdown on some of his dating disasters. Nothing very enduring, however.",34,32
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,"I saw that with this book how guys really evaluate their lives with the women they encounter through out a life time. It's a trial and error, that's until they meet the one they will be with the  rest of their lives.",42,33
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,"Boring and flat. Never funny, never insightful, just one self-centered jerk with no sense of writing style at all. What a waste of 99 cents.",25,34
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,"I didn't really know what to make of this when I finished. The main problem I had with it was that it was poorly written.  No grammatical structure at all and sometimes I didn't know who was talking or who was doing what. Also the girls who were supposedly ""crazy"" were really just irritated at him (I would have been too). Sure some of the girls were a little off but... I don't know.
Okay that all having been said I DID finish it.  It DID keep my interest somewhat.  Would I read it again? No.",96,35
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,"Great short read! I can't understand the negative reviews. Loved Mr. Lance's sense of humor. I'd love to read more by him --- think that you just gotta get his dry, self-deprecating sense of humor. Its a kindle single, so if you pay 99 cents for it, then don't expect a novel. Please read this - enjoy, and don't take yourself too seriously.",63,36
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,2.0,negative,The idea is not a bad one at all: describe catastrophic dates with a light humoristic satiric tone. But each story feels like a draft of its future version - too short and in the end fairly repetitive. There's not enough substance here.,43,37

Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,"Hard to understand why this booklet gets an ""average to good"" rating. It is not funny and not interesting either. The writing is flat. The plot of the 8 short stories/dates mostly documents the inability of the narrator to relate to his dates as human beings who certainly have their failings but do not seem that crazy. It would require much more talent than this writer has to make it acceptable to call crazy a girl who has problems because she was raped !

Please don't give it your 99 cents and your time.",94,39
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,I agree with Loredana: flat and boring covers it for me.  I can't believe there are readers who enjoyed this. I want my 99 cents back.,26,40
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,4.0,positive,This was a fun short to read.  I liked it....mainly because I could relate to those first dates and the craziness of them.  I laughed out loud several times...This is one I would recommend to my single friends.,38,41
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,3.0,neutral,"If you are expecting something spectacular here, you are forgetting that you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a short, mildly entertaining read, this should keep you busy for about an hour.",35,42
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,"Overall, this book was pretty disappointing. First of all, it was short. His whole novel about all the crazy girls he's dated, and there are what, eight date stories? Ten, tops. Plus I think this man has a skewed idea of crazy women. He introduces the book as though he's really dated some weirdos, and you're expecting crazy drunks, total idiots, and maybe some cult followers. Instead you get a girl who is cool and yet, gasp, Christian. Then several girls who are emotionally wounded; I'm talking girls who have been seriously victimized, not silly girls who think a chipped pedicure is an apocalypse. Sure, maybe some of these girls shouldn't have unloaded on the first date. But you can't blame them for having skeletons in their closets. And finally, a couple girls who maybe really did have some problems. Still, most of these can be summed up into a bad breakup, a lot of stress, or maybe PMS. Either way, if this guy thinks all of those girls are crazy, he'll have a hard time finding someone who's not. And then there's the actual writing. It's not horrible. It's not the best. But for a comedian, there should be more jokes, less rambling and fewer bits about the hotness of the few girls you thought it might actually work out with. It doesn't flow, it's not organized, and it needs some serious fleshing out before it's a real book.",240,43
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,i read about how hilarious the book was and bought it for a nice summer reading but it actually made me cry. i even found disgusting the fact that some stories were based on suffering women who were raped or whose mother was killed... i didn't find it funny and had a hard time to keep reading after a while. i understand why the price is 0.99,67,44
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,4.0,positive,"I read this in less than an hour but it made me laugh out loud! As a woman, I'm not offended but if you're sensitive this probably won't be your favorite.",31,45

Really, we all have our baggage, some more some less, but Jeez, there is such a thing as TMI.

I'm not sure what the one star reviewers were expecting here, some sort of revelation about women?",70,46
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,"Boring, flat, uninspiring. And these are the good things I can say about this book. I will refrain to comment on the negative. There is no life in the writing style, no inspiration in the stories, no memorable moments. There is no comedy, no drama, no lessons, no FUN!

I am sure that the rest of the reviewers are part of the author's family because otherwise I cannot understand how somebody would find this pseudo-book interesting at all. How can I get my money back? How about my wasted time?",90,47

Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,1.0,negative,"Based on the description and the reviews, I expected to read about several first dates gone wrong from a comedic standpoint. Comedy, you dig? This book read more like a thinly veiled homage to the author, who tried to be quirky and humble but (IMO) came off like a jerk. Victims of rape and the family of murder victims might have legitimate reasons for emotional imbalance (""crazy""), hmm? Given his seemingly extensive repertoire of dates, he made odd choices to write about for a comedic short. I'd be hard pressed to find something worse that I've wasted $1 and 20 minutes on.",102,49
Kindle_Store,B005CRVGUO,5.0,positive,"Believable story of a man's misadventures of dating in his twenties.  It's good to know that the other half of society has the same problems with dating.  I personaly am so happy the author chose the title ""Crazy Girls"" because many men I know would have went for crazy ""b""s.  I couldn't help but cast this story into a movie as a met each new character.  So here goes my dream line up; a dorky Luke Wilson as Max, Taryn Manning as Ingrid, Zooey Deshchanel as Devon, Alex Meneses as Nina, Brittany Snow as Lauren, Mila Kunis as Tracy, and Alexis Biedel as Jen.  I would love to know how far off my casting is from the truth.",118,50

The author tries too hard. Everything is black or white -- there are no nuances, no subtleties, no insigts. The story is like a stand-up comedy script, which may be fun on stage but not off stage (especially in writing).",64,54

It is as if the sex were written and someone thought other things should be added, but no one knew what, so random phrases were put in such as one lady who says she is, ""Helping people through my work"" - but what does she do - no one tells you.
The sensual parts are well enough written, but leave you wondering how the protagonist got there as the story really doesn't suit such activity. These are just disjointed sex scenes and the parts in the middle are so annoying they ruin even the sex.
The non sex parts are terrible and this ruins all the rest which is a shame.",120,37

The stories here don't just sizzle, they burn - and in some cases, they burn enough to expose some surprising aspects of human nature. If you read erotica regularly, you know that some talk purely about sex (the kind that makes people refer to erotica as porn) and some use erotic language or stories to transcend that and talk about love and life. This collection is the latter. I particularly loved the last story - it was hot, quick and surprisingly poignant.

If there's any free erotica worth getting, this should be it! Don't hesitate and press that button now!

Kindle_Store,B005GXROO6,1.0,negative,"People seem to be attracted to reading pornography because it is often excused as not evil, due to the spiritual ignorance of the masses. For most people think of pornography as a movie or picture that involves ongoing copulation, or even as ""softcore"" as removing the little blackouts from off the nipples. Well, allow me to correct this ignorance, fornication involves more than this, for our Lord Jesus Christ describes to look on a woman to lust after her is to commit adultry with her in the heart. Now take this same concept and consider your wicked immagination lusting after delights that are not your own, nor should be. Do not covet is the command, so consider getting your own husband, or your own wife, and not burn in your lusts. For it is better to marry than to BURN. If your are one who takes pleasure in reading ""erotica"" or should I say, pornography, you should consider this in the same wicked fashion as a whorish movie, or some prostitution house in the slums of town. It is as though a man would walk into a strip club and desperately empty his wallet just to be let down and empied of his soul in the end. These pornographic stories do nothing more than excite the lusts of your flesh and seperate you further from the God Who created you to glorify Him through Holy living. Jesus Christ can redeem you and save you. Call upon His name to be saved! Cry out for His mercy in the depths of your darkness! For this purpose He was sent down unto us, so that we can be set free of the bondage of sin. [...]
Turn from idolatry, eroti is a false god.

It's a short read, about 64 pages, but it is a terrific story.  It blends science fiction with fantasy and it is unlike anything I have  ever read.  I am not a huge sci fi fan normally, so I am always pleasantly surprised when I find something that appeals to me.  The fantasy world exists perfectly alongside the real world and makes for a fantastically interesting story.  Even more interesting to me is that the author is a man and writes such strong and real female characters.  He captures the ""strong but vulnerable"" aspect that I enjoy in realistic women characters.  The mix of mystery, magic, and science fiction was wonderful.  I have seen this book listed in some places as the start of a series, and I truly hope that is the case.",158,1

Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,"For centuries, the witches have controlled the power of magic. They have travelled between the worlds and used their `gifts' freely. But now a wizard has rising and challenging their powers. One by one, three young witches have disappeared. With notes left behind in their place, it was as if the wizard was mocking the witches. The council decides and sends six of their best to find and kill this wizard. With other dead or captured or injured, it falls on Tiffany to take care of the business herself. She is the strongest witch of their generation and turns out to be the only hope that her people could have of survival.

This is an action packed novella of some 55 odd pages. There's a lot in those few pages. We learn a lot about the different worlds, how the witches' council works and how the witches themselves live their lives. There is a lot of action, emotion and drama. There's also a matter of domestic violence handled in this book.

Phil Stern's writing style in unquestionably amazing. Few days back I had the chance to read & review another book of his, and though the plots of both the books are very different - two things about his writing has turned out to be consistently good - his writing style and his characters.  I loved them both.",228,4

Then a very powerful wizard begins attacking and kidnapping witches. They are shocked because it is believed that only females have powers.  So, a group of powerful young witches is sent out to track him down and dispatch of him.
I enjoyed the plot of this book and the characters as well.  The only real disappointment, to me, was the ending.  It was so abrupt, I had no idea I was that close to the end (I use a reader and rarely check to see my progress in a book, esp. if I'm really into it).  I would have liked to know about how things turned out for some of the characters involved, but it was almost open for a sequel.. If Phil Stern does write a sequel, I would definitely read it.
I gave this book 3 stars.",167,5
Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,"Phil Stern is an unusual author.  If you did not know that his name was Phil and he was a man it would be easy to think he was a female as his writings often have female leads and he is in tune with that strong, yet vulnerable side women really want to see in female leads.  You know this is true, when you are alone at home you yell at the foolish girls in movies that go into dark basements with no weapons and die, or have to be rescued; wonder why anyone would go into the woods on a hike in skimpy clothing and high heels; and bemoan the weak woman who needs to be rescued.

Real women are strong, weak, vulnerable, powerful, and use all of that to take care of themselves and everyone around them.  This is what Tiffany does in Witches.  She has had a rough life, we find out, but she doesn't whine or blame anyone.  She works hard to help others and she is more powerful that you would think.

Phil Stern brings this world to life and makes you want to get in there and help Tiffany, not because she needs it but because she brings out that quality in you.  I enjoyed this book.  I read it in one sitting and was totally amazed to find that time had passed while I was in this other world.

My only complaint was that the story ends with characters that hadn't been introduced before and I was really confused by it.  I am going to hope that as I read more I can connect these character in another book to help me come to some sense as to why they suddenly showed up.

I give this 4 out of 5 clouds.",298,6
Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,"The more books I read that are fantasy based the more I realize it's a genre I've been missing out on for a while. Witches conveys in great dialogue, and smooth flowing descriptions another world that is in chaos. It is also the second volume in Phil Stern' Unbridled Boundary series.
  A young witch finds her world is threatened by a wizard who is trying to claim power over the witches, and destroy the most powerful. The witch must also face her own family issues that she has yet to deal with.
  I want to begin by saying that the writing has a very nice flow to it. You can get lost in the words by reading it because the words string together so smoothly. The writing was perhaps my favorite thing about this novella.
  The characters are also very complex. There are many layers as to why they feel compelled to do the things they do, even the evil wizard.  The book features a huge cast of characters from a variety of walks of life, and the reader can almost find something to identify with any of them.
  If you are looking for an action packed fantasy then this is the book you've been seeking.  It keeps you intently interested from beginning to end.",215,7
Kindle_Store,B005IL1T4M,4.0,positive,"In the world of Witches, it seems like young women can't catch a break. Abused by their fathers and envied by their mothers, they seek shelter in the magical world of Haven. Here they hone their powers and cross boundaries into other dimensions. When a rare male wizard kidnaps several young witches, Haven must take action. Tiffany, a rebellious young witch, is drafted to search for her missing ""sisters,"" beginning a cross-dimensional quest against the forces of evil.

But whose evil? With the possible exception of Tiffany, everyone in this story commits reprehensible acts. The villain is odious, but his cruel quest for revenge is built up with a heart-rending backstory. The plight of the young witches is sympathetic, but it is impossible to endorse the social structure of the coven, which thrives off its own form of sexual abuse. Tiffany seems largely unaware of her miserable circumstances. While she is beginning to question the mores of the world around her, she never considers (or experiences) an alternative. In a truly feminist book, either romantic love or sisterhood would win the day. Here Tiffany remains isolated, her future unclear.

This is not to say that Witches is a bad book; this is not a negative review. I believe the moral ambiguity in Witches is intentional. The story is well-written and plotted, the magic is exciting, and the moral mysteries will keep me occupied for some time. There are many who are clearly wrong, but who is in the right?",249,8

Kindle_Store,B0063LJRLI,3.0,neutral,"This is a gothic romance, with a huge, dark castle, towers, cliffs, villains, secrets, and a resident ghost. Catherine is a 20 year old girl who, because of a family misunderstanding, was reared as a servant by her aunt and uncle in the United States. Her father sends his ward to retrieve her when he realizes that he is dying.

The story is in 1st person, told from Catherine's point of view. The ""dark lord,"" Jonathan, is her father's ward who is sent to bring her home. Her feelings about him gave me whiplash more than once. She seemed taken with him upon meeting him, sharing all sorts of information about her life, but then she becomes intractable and uncooperative even though she's willing to return to her father's house, simply to annoy him. Why she, as a 20 year old who has been cooped up in her relatives' attic, believes that she knows more about traveling the world than a viscount who has traveled around the world.

Simply put, Catherine is stupid. She is told repeatedly to trust certain people and yet puts her trust in those who she has the fewest reasons to trust. She never asks questions, never has anything explained to her, and completely ignores the obvious. By the time she stops being oblivious and gets some gumption the novel is nearly over. It is a gentle novel suitable for the young, but it is slow, and Catherine is an annoying heroine.",246,2

Characters thin, plot a cliche: lost heiress held 'captive' by wicked aunt and uncle plus the ubiquitious malicious cousin, predictably blond, beautiful and spiteful.
Enter mail-order tall, dark, handsome Heathcliffe type who snatches heroine and returns her to her long-lost and of course, stupendously rich, titled father.
Naturally, despite having only known her saviour for a blink of an eye, and having doubts about his motives, our heroine realises she 'loves' him.  Ho hum.
Meanwhile, at the castle, attempted murder, mayhem, mysterious assassins abound. Can she trust her hero or is he, too, after her money?
Rapunzel is trapped in the tower. Cue the ghost.
Saved by the humble but devoted stable boy, who naturally is the bastard son of neighboring gentry, our heroine avoids being thrown from her horse, but falls of a cliff rescuing a dog that looks suspicously like Paris Hiltons?  Oh, no, that's wrong.  Like the one owned by that nasty cousin.  Does heroine put two and two together and arrive at three people trying to do away with her? Duh.
Implausibly, given her inability to draw obvious conclusions, our dim-witted wench unearths the motive for the attempts on her life in a daunting legal tome, and equally preposterous after earlier brainless behaviour, then goes on to outwit her would-be assassins putting an end to their nefarious scheme.

At this point the reader has asked, several times: Why did the dastardly aunt and jealous cousin not do away with this twit when she was a child?

She's left everything and everyone behind in hopes of saving others like she couldn't save her mother or sister.  The cause is noble, but even from the very beginning seemed a little shortsighted.

When the Amazon warriors rescue her from a kidnapping attempt, she figures she's been saved.  She didn't know that she was just in another form of kidnapping.  She never attempts to escape, just keeps going on doing her research, blah, blah, blah.

It's not until her jilted lover/boyfriend, Logan Spencer, is brought into the Amazon Valley that Elizabeth develops a sense of needing to run away from the Amazons.  Suddenly, the possibility of Logan being gang raped by a bunch of crazy women has lit a fire under Elizabeth to get the hell out of Dodge.

Logan is one of those men that we all hope our significant others will be should some dyer situation come up where we're missing.  He never gave up looking for Elizabeth. She broke his heart and left him, but he takes every opportunity to trudge through the Amazon jungle looking for her.  Despite the anger he felt when she left him, he still knew that Elizabeth was the one for him and just about sprayed her with his desire.

During that time, he man is searching for her. The Amazons find him too and intend to keep him as a stud. After all, as the Amazon queen says, ""He is male, is he not? Males rut."" LOL

But this male, Logan, only has eyes for the doctor, Elizabeth and after they rekindle their love, they aim to escape, even if it means trusting another Amazon to help them.

Exciting and fun and a great plot. I loved the whole Amazon warrior tribe, but it was too short for this type of tale. I wanted to know more..

Dr. Logan Spencer was looking for his lover who has been missing for two years, Dr. Elizabeth DeMarco. What they both have inadvertently discovered perhaps could be a cure for many ailments and will most likely be the death of both of them.

Liz and Logan have many regrets. They would both like to change the events that separated them to begin with. Once reunited in the Amazon's medical facility they both decide that they need to escape so that they can move past their regrets and go forth towards a happier life with each other. There's just one problem. A mythical force that they lack the ability to manipulate holds them captive. Time is growing very short for Logan and the Amazon's plans for him.

Amazon Heat is an exciting novella, telling the story of two doctors/lovers trying to escape the nefarious plans of a secret Amazon civilization. The Amazon women want their secret to remain hidden from the rest of the world. They cannot allow anyone who knows of them to ever leave their secret society.

The heroine may have been smart enough to get into the prestigious academy but she didn't come across as an intellectual at all. None of the characters seemed to have substance or depth. If no one was talking, the book went much better. Very difficult to finish as I stopped caring about the characters and their problems.

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,For a young market this is quite interesting but maybe a little predictable.  There is a lack of tension throughout that prevents me from reading further in the series but it is well written and may satisfy younger readers who relate to girl group dynamics.

My perspective is that the beginning of the book was much better than the end. I understood exactly what she was doing until the moment she introduced the crystals. From there she lost me. I understand the pull to paranormal fiction, and I think Sarah has talent, but the idea was just too convoluted. She went from this extremely descriptive detailed story line to...a mashup of ideas all piled together. The villain Chris is so superficial and comic bookish. He is so underdeveloped. And the crystals? What do the crystals do? How did the one friend know so much about them? It was a riddle and to be honest it was too confusing and vague to even want to find out more.",147,24

The main idea for the ""scy-fi"" is a little rough. However, not to dissuade the younger reader, as it's enough for you to want to keep reading to see the end result, and I know the writer will continue to improve!",72,83
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"The first thing I want to say is, this book does have promise. I love the idea behind it but, unfortunately, felt like it fell flat for me. Typically, I finish a book in a day and I found myself struggling to to get back into this one over a period of several.

As others have mentioned, it was pretty slow in the beginning. Not much happened, in my opinion, until the middle and even then I felt like the action was pretty lackluster. I felt as if the characters were very underdeveloped, as well. At the end of the book, I still felt like I didn't know any of the them. And some characters (Ex: the doctor in the beginning) are made out to seem as if they'll play an important roll later on but are never heard from or seen again.

Not to mention the fact that the so-called ""forbidden romance"" that I was so anxious to get into hardly played a role in the story. Aside from a few minuscule scenes (only on of which contained anything even remotely romantic) it was basically non-existent. And the reason why it was ""forbidden"" was completely absurd to me (possibly because it was never truly explained)  I was disappointed. As a whole, for me, there was too much unimportant filler material and not enough of what was promised in the book description.

The only thing that kept me from giving this book one star is the fact that I really do like the concept behind the author's take on the supernatural. Otherwise, it was a complete miss for me. So much so, in fact, that I chose to return it. Part of me wants to read on in the series to see if it ever improves but at this point, I highly doubt I will.",305,84

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"There were 5 things that made it hard to like this book:

1. The author does not know the correct definition of the word ""penultimate"" yet insists on repeatedly using it.

2. The line about butter being scraped thin over toast - yeah Tolkien worded it so much better.

3. The main character's description of the old sailor at the beginning is quite racist.  She doesn't trust him because of his crude Easten European, possible Russian, accent.  If this book had been written in the Cold War, it would be one thing, but it wasn't.  It makes the main character unlikeable right from the get-go and I therefore couldn't sympathise with her during the entire book.

4. None of the other characters were particularly likeable either.

5. The action of the book doesn't really begin until about halfway through.  As I'd bought a bunch of books at once for my Kindle, I wasn't sure what sort of book this was supposed to be, and by the time the plot actually unfolded, it was hard for me to care.

I thought the concept for this book was interesting, and the prose itself flowed decently but there were not enough things to like about this book to overcome the things I didn't.  I won't be continuing to read this series, or probably anything else by this author.",225,87
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,CHOSEN seemed to go on and on and on without ever getting to the point.  I wish the author would have put some more hints or clues as to what the point of the book was.  I got 50% into it and finally just stopped reading.  It was well written in that the author was able to keep me reading for 50% without anything really happening.  Seriously... nothing happened.,69,88
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,"I really wanted to like this book, but the plot was slow, the characters underdeveloped, and the writing itself was juvenile. The author seems to just throw certain words around, without them making sense, or sometimes without the words fitting the tome of the book.
An example of it not making sense:
""'Sounds exciting,"" I said drily.' In my experience, anything put together by anybody with a connection to administration ended up being completely moronic and lame.
'You sound less than impressed,' the doctor quickly added with an equal amount of sarcasm.""
He isn't being sarcastic, he is recognizing that she is not excited to go to the event. However, that could be me just being picky.
An example of not fitting the tone:
""To my surprise, the doctor laughed. I was taken aback, at first, but then realized he was laughing gregariously, rather than derisively""
It's as if the author was just trying to show off that she knew big words. Or perhaps she used a thesaurus, I don't know. And yes, she did use that many unnecessary commas in one sentence and misspell the word dryly. Usually I can still read a book with things like this in it, but it happens ALL THE TIME! I am a teen, this book is aimed towards my age group and I disliked it strongly. Maybe they assumed that, as teens, we shouldn't care about things like poor character development, but we do.",242,89

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,"I just never cared about the characters! The plot was slow with very little build up.  Chris was predictably the bad guy, but still played along like the reader couldn't guess. Worst book I have read in a while :(",40,91
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,"Ok, so personally, this book was just OK to me. It was too slow paced for the first half and there was too much repetition in Tracy's internal dialogue for me. Also, I felt like there were a lot of events that were left unexplained and the characters lacked growth and depth as the story progressed.

BUT, if you make it through this book, the second book is GREAT!!! I really enjoyed the forward by the author that explains how she took her reader's suggestions about the first book to heart. Honestly, I think that she did a FANTASTIC job catering to what her readers wanted. The second book is believable, fast paced, and the characters actually grow, and there's a LOT of action! In conclusion, I give this book about 2 stars, and the second book 5 stars. (So, when you average that out, it's a 3.5 stars for the series so far)",154,92
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,"This book was a fresh new concept - there's vampires and werewolves and elves running around most of the young adult literature, this one dealt with crystals.  The story was slow for the first 1/2 but the second half picked up the pace.  Interesting characters and storyline.  Not going to read the sequal as it's not pulling me in to want more.  i found myself scanning through a lot of the pages because I wasn't interested in the detail of her walking through the woods, etc. But if you have time and you want a break from the typical paranormal it's not bad but it's not great.",107,93

Every chapter has something new, exciting, and fresh.  It did not make me cringe at all like a lot of Teen paranormal fantasy books out there, actually made me very engrossed in the mind of the main character which is surprising becaues she has very special abilities like the others in the book, which is a great supernatural gift

I highly recommend reading this, and although the start was slow it really picked up. And the second book is a LOT better too with so much action, a great series to just get away from it all.",116,95

The description of all the characters was like a sexy romance novel, no one had a consistant personality, the crystal stuff just about put me to sleep, and the only character I kind of liked was, for some reason, revieled to be the bad guy near the beginning of the book rather than in the end where it might have made some kind of impact. I will not be reading the next book.

Also, the cover image, it's so pretty and honestly part of the reason I wanted to read the book, but that scene never happens. There is even a point when the main character says she didn't bring any of her nice clothes with her to the island, let along a gown.",144,97

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"... otherwise I would have been mad about the money spent. Overall, this book is just pretty lame. There are many scenes especially but not only in the beginning that are explained in way too much detail and which could be cut short by several pages. Even if the pace picks up towards the end, it does still not get riveting. One major problem being that the story is largely really predictable - it just takes the heroine ages to put two and two together. Always. Furtheremore, the author resolves in too many cases to totally steoretypical and lame story elements. Oooooooh, the island used to be an asylum way back then where prisoners were mistreated, uhuh, there is thick fog when the heroine (already forgot here name) tries to get onto the island and so on. In the end, the bad guy is hunchbacked for the rest of his life and swears revenge - right. Bad guy with a hunch, that's a new one. Not. In general, the bad guys' ambition is not really clear nor explored, except that they want power and money.

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,I have read Yearbooks with a better plot. this was like a bad tiger beat magazine mixed with a after school special from the 90's. i was really looking forward to the concept of magic use in relation to crystals. but found it hard just to follow the story line with out wishing the main character would get some counseling at some point and stop talking about which boy was cuter or who she HAD to be friends with in her new school.

I finished it, but it was not because I felt compelled by the amazing plot- it was more because I had to know if any of the pieces came together.  They do not* spoiler*  The plot elements never come together- the story line is trite and the characters are really boring.  There is all of this lead up and it goes nowhere.  The reviewers that said this was well-written were being too kind.  It reads like a middle schoolers first story notebook. I was not impressed.  I read a lot of YLA and I was hoping for potential .  This is not worth your time.",117,108
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,I bought this book based on the reviews I had read on Amazon. I'm sorry to say it was massively disappointing. It's an immature imagining of fantasy for teens. Many parts read like a middle aged woman trying to sound like a teen. The plot was stilted and poorly paced and the ending was abrupt and poorly done. I'm just glad that I only paid 99 cents for it.,69,109
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,The story was slow. The author spent too much time describing things on the island and not enough time on the plot. Nothing actually happens until almost half way through the book and the writing was somewhat juvenile. I don't have any desire to read the rest of the series.,50,110
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,"This book is a good book, but doesn't really end on anything. The ending felt like it was hurried in order to not give too much information away, so that she could write a second book. Also the love in the story was lacking. She does have a little romance with someone, but it is only for about 4 pages and then over. This book is more of an action novel than a romance novel. However, I would recommend this book for friends, but would not pay more than .99 for the book. I will most likely read the second book of the series.",104,111
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"This book is so-so. I thought that Tracy was an intriguing protagonist and the world- building was done fairly well.  I got a great sense of what a ""crystal seeker"" was and yet the author still manages to leave some mysteries surrounding these crystals in order to pique my interest. Because of this I just might read the next book.

Another strong point of the novel is the author's writing.  The descriptions are wonderfully vivid and I can just close my eyes and perfectly imagine the island and boarding school.

Now why just two stars then?

Well, for starters the ""bad"" guys of the novel are almost laughably stereotypical, and as well-rounded as the female characters are developed, the male ones are the opposite.  Completely one-dimensional.  I also hope that the author won't be focusing too much on love in the future installments because in this novel it appears to be as though she's building up to a triangle or quadrangle, whatever, but love and lust falls flat here.  Probably because the males aren't developed enough and because I'm tired of the whole ""love at first sight"" trope.  Especially when it's obvious to the reader that the male romantic interest is no good at all for our heroine.  It just makes reading their scenes together painful.  If we're going to get invested in that storyline, at least make the guy somewhat interesting.

Another critique:  it's just very hard to suspend disbelief at the whole boarding school situation.  It's on a little island, parents can't visit at all and yet they allow thei kids to attend.

Overall, it's an okay read that's only somewhat entertaining, but it would have been much better if the villains were also better and the guys not so dull and simple.",295,112

What I didn't like was how the main characters don't really seem to grow as much as they seem to have multiple personalities. Some of them start off as terrible mean girls who suddenly are kind of cool. And I won't spoil the surprise for anyone who still wants to waste their time, but let's just say for me it was dissapointing and not developed. The only action, and it's not even exciting enough to be called action was in the last couple chapters. The writer did a good job of making me curious, and thats about all. I was so let down with what was all revealed. BORING.",130,116

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,4.0,positive,"This book really took me by surprise. As I search amazon this was in my recommendations bar. I went ahead and took a chance to read something else other than what I must read. And you know what, I like it. I had only meant to read just a chapter or two and before I knew it, it was 1AM!

What hooked me to this book is the great plot line. I am sucker for boarding school stories but also the fact that they are on an island! I really enjoyed how with every new chapter more about the school and it's purposes are exposed.

The characters of the book were good. Each were clear with their motive from the start which was sort of strange and refreshing to read. Usually, you have to read more to pull more of the characters out. They did have secrets but it wasn't gasping.

I also adored the magic twist to it. I read so many stories about powers and how the characters get them, so when I read this twist I was intrigued. And it kept me entertain till the end of the book.

Overall, this is a good book. Chosen is wise and witty with refreshing characters. It's not like most book out there, really different. If your looking for a new twist in magic or powers, read this book.",229,119

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,"This book was pretty good, I wouldn't say it was the best ever. It had an interesting premise and there was plenty of good imagery around the setting of the island. The problem for me was the characters, they fell completely flat. I didn't feel like any of them where good people and all of them were far to annoying and whiny. They constantly felt like Mary Sue characters to me each of them acted just exactly as cliche dictates they should. I will definitely keep an eye out for the next book to see if the character building improves because like I said this story has a very interesting premise.",111,121

Well, I mean, conceptually it's somewhat interesting but I couldn't stop thinking that this was a supernaturally tinted version of ""Mean Girls"" or something along those lines. It doesn't have the greatest flow and can be choppy at times. My biggest annoyance was the jarring switch from first person to third person when talking from another character's perspective. The story is predictable and the characters don't always have the best depth but it's an entertaining read none the less.",118,123

Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,"After reading a few reviews, I was really interested in this series and thought I would love it.  Sadly, I was more disappointed and at this time don't feel a great need to continue with the rest of the series.  I think the author tries too hard to build tension in spots where there really isn't enough suspense or action to move the story along.  I always try to finish a book through, giving it the benefit of doubt that it will get better, but again I don't think Chosen is strong enough or compelling enough at this time.  The story is based on Tracey, a high school junior, relocating to an exclusive school on a remote island.  The island was a former prison and is supposed to hold hidden mysteries.  Tracey is quickly sucked into a clique of friends who are secretly ""crystal seekers"".  Tracey learns she possesses the power to be a crystal seeker as well, but tries to avoid and/or decline this magical gift. During the story, it never gives a clear grasp on what the magical capabilities are.  Tracey's new friends, as well as the villain in the story are trying to use Tracey in order to achieve greater power and rule the world.  There's an attempt at a bit of a love connection with Tracey and Robb, but I felt that was lacking as well.  Also, the author tries to make the villain(s) more sinister and evil, but I just felt that this missed the mark as well.",253,126

I'm really into YA and Paranormal Romance Novels but I get bored really quick with the same Vampire, fairy, angel, werewolve story. This IS NOT one of those stories at all. The basis behind this story is a completely different idea. I want to call it a new idea cause I've never seen it but I did kinda remind me of The Secret Circle in a tiny way.

I would rank the book lower, but I did finish it.",90,133
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"I bought this for my Kindle because it sounded like a good story and the cover looked interesting but the story was boooorrring and took too long for anything to develop.  None of the characters were very sympathetic or likable, including Tracy, the heroine of the book.  All she ever did was whine and complain, and the secondary characters were selfish and bitchy.  Also, I don't understand the cover because Tracy never wore a ballgown in the book, she only wore jeans, and what is with the butterflies?  I don't get it.  Maybe if I was a teenage girl, I might like it but I am a grown woman and I could not get into this book.",117,134

I don't think the basic premise of the plot is bad, but it needs to move a little faster.",77,136
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,1.0,negative,"I agree with the other reviews. It was EXTREMELY SLOW for the first 7 chapters. It DID pick up a little, however, not enough.

Can I have back the time I spent reading this book? SO. BORING.",64,137
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"This book came up as a recommendation for me and after reading all the five star reviews and seeing the low price, I thought why not?

I thought the story started strangely, there was a whole page about the significance of the date September 23rd of all things.  I thought Tracy's back story of wanting to go to a good school was interesting and different but as soon as we got to part where she has to travel to the school alone, things got sketchy.  The whole situation was too weird and ridiculous to believe.  It might be because being on a creepy island in the middle of nowhere where people rarely leave, sometimes it sounded like they couldn't leave, doesn't appeal to me at all.  But Tracy seemed to eat it up despite several ominous warnings.  Everything was just so weird, I couldn't believe the things that Tracy went along with.

I didn't like any of the girls in the group, not sure why I was supposed to and the love interest didn't seem to have any redeeming qualities beyond having pretty eyes.  I'm not sure what happened around chapter seven to make the story seem better but I never made it there.  It shouldn't take that long for a story to get interesting.  If you don't hook me in the first three chapters, we're done.

I guess if you don't mind a very slow story build up and weird situations then this is the story for you but if not, don't waste your money, there are thousands of other YA romances to read that are done better.",269,138
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,3.0,neutral,"First off, this book's cover has nothing to do with the book itself. This girl doesn't even like to dress up! I understand the color correlation, but that's it.

On to the book: The writing is a bit choppy, but it's easy to ignore. Thankfully, the editing is good. What I couldn't ignore was the 'heroine's' ridiculousness. It's like she had no will of her own and was so into herself that she didn't even notice her 'friends' were not her friends. I am disappointed that she isn't a stronger character. Also the dialogue is a bit redundant. Okay, very redundant. There are paragraphs where something is being explained, then the next character explains it AGAIN.

The idea is different, and for that alone, gives the review a few stars. I highly enjoy the ability these characters have, and there's great potential here, but it's not clear exactly what can be done with them. 'Taking over the world', and 'her eyes filled with greed' are not helpful if you have no idea how they can be accomplished.

The 'bad guy' was also a bit ridiculous. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be a whodunnit, but there is no way to hide who he was in this writing.

Sadly, I will not be reading any sequels of this book. The promise is there, and I am sure the writer will do better the next book, but I am already turned off to the writing and characters, especially the main one.",251,139
Kindle_Store,B006L4C066,2.0,negative,"I was really excited to dig into this book from all of the really great reviews. It seemed like everyone agreed that the book really picked up after Chapter 7 but once I reached it I only continued to be disappointed. I had a REALLY hard time getting into the characters in this book. The romance aspect completely fell flat *spoiler*, I honestly left the book asking myself ""does Rob even serve a purpose?"". The author hyped up this intense connection between Rob and Tracy but NOTHING HAPPENS. It was blatantly obvious, well atleast to me, who the villain was in this book. Not to mention you don't get to know the girls that *spoiler* are part of the crystal seekers AT ALL. They are all just rude and I feel the dialogue runs around in circles. There was no character development within this book and Tracy herself was bland and whiny.

I think the overall idea/plot could be really great, its very original and with the right direction could really be something compared to all the other YA books. I would just like to see some more ""character exploring"" within the next book and less monotonous writing on how Tracy felt about trying to ""get out"" of the situation she was in.

All and all I wish Tracy embraced her situation more in this book and that we were able to get to know the characters instead of just seeing the glimpse as to what they could be.

I loved how Sophia Sharp really developed each character. I have read her dream realms trilogy and i will say im HOOKED on her writing. I highly recommend this book...

I had read Sophia's books before, so I wasn't surprised when this turned out to be one of the best books I ever read, but it was still AMAZING!! It took a few days for me to read it, but I finished it and wanted to read it all over again. Reading about Tracy and her life on Traven Island was so intriguing, I couldn't put the book down. Sophia unravels the secrets hidden on this island and within Tracy very carefully. If you look closely, several chapters convey secrets that lead to a shocker ending that made me go 'How did I NOT see that coming?!'. Tracy finds that life isn't always normal, and that speaks volumes for all of us. Life is unpredictable, and Tracy doesn't handle it the best way, but her intention comes out in the end. This is a book a would totally recommend to ANY reader who loves paranormal. If you read like me, you LIVE in paranormal books (Twilight, Dream Realms, etc.), and this book doesn't overdue it.

Given the price of this book and the other puzzlebooks, I'd recommend spending the additional few dollars to get 10 times as many puzzles... once you start playing, you're going to want to do more of them.

I have a K3 so the color doesn't come through on my device.  However, the puzzles are easy to decipher without requiring the color so there's no loss of functionality because of that.  The puzzles and answers are easy to navigate (just use your page forward/back and 5-way controller), but make sure to read the directions before you start or you'll jump to the answers instead of the next puzzle.  I did find the ""solution"" pages to be a little sparse for some of the puzzles, especially for the one puzzle I guessed at.  Once I knew the answer, I went back to the puzzle and was able to figure out why it was the answer, but some additional explanation would have been nice.

Finally, an observation I had after having played many of the Amazon Digital Services games.  There are no hints, timer, or score with this game.  Again, not a criticism - it is an electronic puzzlebook after all - but just be aware of that if you like to play logical games for time.",281,21
Kindle_Store,B006OFRGDY,1.0,negative,"I am a certified personal trainer and part of what makes me knowledgeable is that I constantly seek self improvement. I do this by researching books and articles. With that said, I read tip number 8.

It hits the nail on the head in regards to the importance of breakfast. However the composition of the food is not going to help you lose weight. In fact it will do the opposite and cause you to gain weight.

The foods suggested are on the medium to high side of the glycemic index. These foods will quickly turn into sugar in your blood, causing a spike in insulin, which then promotes fat storage.

These foods will cripple your metabolism. Instead of utilizing fat to create energy your body will use the sugar you just fed on and store the excess sugar as fat to be utilized later... or not... Depending on what other tips you decide to use from this book.

Protein is the most thermogenic nutrient a person can consume. Your body burns almost twice as many calories breaking down protein than it does fats or carbohydrates. Therefore in order to speed up your metabolism you should think about consuming protein for breakfast combined with SLOW carbohydrates. The ones that are on the far low side of the glycemic index. Those are the ones that will release energy slowly.

The only suitable time to eat foods on the high side of the glycemic index is immediately after a workout. Your body needs the FAST carbohydrates to recover and repair.

For fifty years, I have been blessed with excellent health and had the metabolism to burn off whatever I ate no matter what it was and what quantity I ingested. I was always naturally slim and muscular. My dad grew up on a farm and at when I was only seven he made sure my family was going to get a taste of the farm life too. Taking care of the animals and gardening contributed to my body build. On this farm I learned to hustle while working. There was much work to be done and other stuff I wanted to be doing, so the only way to get to do what I wanted to do was to hustle through the chores. LIttle did I know that this would forever shape the way I went about doing work for the rest of my life. The payoff was never worrying about weight gain or what I ate. Donuts, big gulps,bowls of ice cream,barbeque. No worries until I surpassed the age of fifty.

But I admit that seeing a few sentences per main entry can teach a few adjectives, verb forms in the present, and sentence structures. I like reading material to begin to get the hang of grammar in a foreign language, by immersion as well as study of the structure. You may be able to chat with Italian preschoolers if you use this.. Or at least spend a bit of spare time on a Kindle more profitably than at some repetitive game shifting blocks.

Kindle_Store,B006OIUFG6,3.0,neutral,It is a free app so there is no reason to be critical.  There is a limited amount of vocabulary but it is handy,24,53
Kindle_Store,B006OIUFG6,3.0,neutral,I downloaded this for free and it is just vocabulary words with examples of the words used in sentences..  It is not really instructional but it was a good basic tool to add to your vocabulary.,36,54

Kindle_Store,B006OIUFG6,2.0,negative,Not at all what I expected.  More fluff than substance.  It's more an unfinished outline than a finished book.

Kindle_Store,B006OIUFG6,5.0,positive,This book is just perfect to begin learning the Italian language. This book teaches basic words and phrases that would come in handy when speaking the language. It is easy to learn and anyone can apply these lessions into any italian conversation. I recommend this book to anyone looking to learn a new language.,54,71
Kindle_Store,B006OIUFG6,1.0,negative,"The audio arrived on my iTunes file... but i have no idea where to find the book that goes with it.

Learn Italian - Word Power 101 gives you translations of common English words and puts them into sentences as examples. It's simple but it doesn't show you how to pronounce it, which I guess you would have to go to Youtube or Google translate to find that out. It also doesn't teach you basic grammar, so you're basically stuck with these words and sentences as your Italian knowledge.",84,80

Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,5.0,positive,"I have recently completed an intensive elementary course in Spanish and this book is great practice. It has 100 nouns and uses each of them in 4-5 sentences.

I went to the website listed in the book. Every time I tried to acquire the audio book it sent me to audio.com website to PURCHASE the audio companion. In Amazon's description of the book, it lists a complimentary audio to accompany the Spanish-Word Power 101. Not so. Buyer beware.",73,1
Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,4.0,positive,"What's cool about this book is that you unknowingly incorporate the language into your brain by just going through the words lists. Not only do you associate the original vocabulary word with the picture but you also learn various adjectives and other relevant vocabulary words in the examples sentences. This is great because you get a ""feel"" for how the language actually works! Here are the highlights:

~Pros:
  *Picture/Word Associations
  *Chooses vocabulary that is in your natural environment - so you can actually identify it and make the connection
  *Sample examples using other relevant vocabulary allowing you to get a ""feel"" for grammatical structure
  *Free
~Cons:
  *It truly is only for vocabulary- would recommend to someone with at least an intro background
  *Doesn't help with actually speaking the language or grammatical aspects",132,2
Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,4.0,positive,"The audio which accompanies book must be purchased separately, so if you're trying to learn how to speak Spanish and have never taken it before,  this won't help much. If you want this as a vocabulary refresher or reminder or enhancer,  or if you only want to learn to read rudimentary Spanish (we're not talking DON QUIXOTE,  here) then this book is excellent. With audio, it would've earned 5*",69,3

Animals (dog, cat, bird, turkey, sheep, cow, etc..) body parts for the head (neck, chin, forehead, taste bud, blond hair, black hair, beard, etc.), other body parts (foot, elbow, bone, backbone, stomach, etc.), basic colors, fruits & veggies (corn, potato, soybean, banana, mushroom, etc...), and numbers 0-10. Each English word is followed by a photo, the word in Spanish, then some examples of usage (phrases or in a sentence).

Useful for a 3rd grader, maybe. I got this for free, thank goodness.  I've already deleted it from my Kindle.",120,4

Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,2.0,negative,"This short ebook has a strange collection of words. It is definitely not for the beginner. For example, why did they feel the need to add the phrase ""butchered horsemeat"", instead of more helpful and common words that one would come across? Beats me. The only thing this book is good for, in my opinion, is practicing your pronunciations (if you have a basic knowledge of Spanish). Glad I didn't pay for it.",73,6

Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,2.0,negative,"First let me say this book is supposed to be used with an additional program which you download from the internet.  I didn't avail myself of that program so perhaps it would make some difference in your results but I'm not so sure.

This book seemed to assume the student will instinctivly know how to pronounce not only the key word but also words in complete, fairly complex sentences.  There is no mention of the alphabet nor proper pronunciation of said letters.
The student is expected to begin immediately parroting difficult sentences with somewhat unusual content.  Simply put, this book seems like an exercise in frustration for ANY beginner.  You didn't start reading with the Gettysburgh address and you don't begin sucessfully learning a foreign language without the necessary background information.",131,8

While my list of 101 words and this list might have some overlap, there wouldn't be much.",85,9

Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,1.0,negative,"If you are really interested in learning Spanish, do not you waste your time with this book.  The first word you will learn in this book is the Spanish word for bird (P&aacute;jaro).  Now just think about how often you use that word in your usual daily conversations and you get an idea how useful this book will be.  It goes on to give you the words for several other animals.  But the real purpose of this book is to steer you to the company's website SpanishPod101.com which is poorly laid out and difficult to navigate.  Many of the links on it (Including the self assessment test) require a premium membership.  Though the price is not that exorbitant, ($4 per month for basic), I don't see enough to entice me to want to go any further. It doesn't look like a fast way to become fluent.  I think that would defeat their real purpose: to keep you paying them month after month.

The men really need to come up to the 21st century.  Maybe the human women can get they up to speed on some of the new way of living.  They were hilarious though.  Why didn't the women dragons get in trouble for what they did; well what one of them did.  Overall the book was good.  Im very excited to read the next installment.

Kindle_Store,B006OIUEKI,3.0,neutral,"the cool thing about this serices of books is that the various languages all use the same words ... getting the companion audio from the publishers website was so frustrating that for now giving up was my preferred option.

each book in the series has pictures (cat, cow) and related sentences ... a friend with a Kindle told me that some (not all) of the audio is available also from Kindle.

Downside of the audio, it only says the words (cat, cow) and not the related sentences which would be much more useful.

Some of the books in the 101 series currently cost a buck, others three bucks ... for zero to three cents a word, you can learn to say gato (cat) and vaca (cow) in many different languages.

One major problem is that they do not show the gender (male, female, neuter) with the word (some languages have only male and female gender); if you know some grammar, you may be able to guess the gender from the example sentences, however, it would be better if they gave the gender and definite article with each word.

Correction:  the gender is there, but is below the word; the article would be useful:  el gato instead of just gato; in school we were taught to always memorize the definite article with the noun because it's much easier to remember the gender.

a pronunciation guide of some sort would be useful.

Evelyn lives in a world where `takers' steal people's `Essence' and leave them for dead. One morning her best friend (Jaeger) turns up at the caf where she works, and she can immediately tell - someone has taken his essence.
Knowing that she only has a short time to try to get Jaeger's essence back before he dies, Evelyn sets about trying to find the taker who took Jaeger's essence, and get it back.

This was an okay short story, but all the stuff about the takers was a bit overkill for such a short story. This story is literally bam, bam, bam, the end. Very short, and with quite a bit of information and action crammed into one short novella.
I thought the romance felt a little false, and Jaeger's sister's reaction to it was a little odd also.
Overall; action packed short story.

One minute they are catching up, the next they are having sex and then the next they are going to get together anytime they can find time and thats it. End of story. But it was free and tolerable. So 3 stars.",71,5

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,I thought this was a cute read and at time funny. It is a nice way to get a taste of the authors style of writing which I thought was good. The story does end on a happy note but there is no closure so you do not know if things work out or not. With that said I would be interested in reading the rest of this author book of Trina and Hutches story. The author could go in a lot of ways. It has a wonderful plot I just need more to go on. I am giving this a 3.5 since it has no closure and rounding it up to a 4 because I thought it was a nice funny read.,123,10

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,"This is a really cute and fun read.  It's fairly short, I was actually able to complete it in under an hour, but I still enjoyed it immensely.  I loved the feel of the small town and the cute, homey names of the stores such as the Likity Split and the Spirits & Spurs.  It reminded me quite a bit of my teenage years that I spent in a small town.

I loved the addition of a teenage crush coming to fruition later in life.  I had a similar conversation as a young adult with my teenage crush and although it didn't come to such a happy ending as this one, I found this story extremely nostalgic.  I loved the added worry about parents hearing them in the bedroom, it added some teenage angst that made the book all that much more nostalgic to me.

Not only was this book sweet, it also had it's moments of fantastic humour, such as the parents downstairs doing basically the same thing as their children.  I found the morning after exchange hilarious and was embarrassed for the couple.

My only complaint about this book is that since it's so short, the ending doesn't have as much resolution as I'd like.  I really wish the author had gone further into the story to give this couple the HEA that they deserved.

Definitely a cute, quick read for a dull night.",236,19

This was a cute story of 2 people who liked each other while in school, but didn't act on it due to Katrina being 2 yrs younger and was Hutchs best friend, Nashs sister.. so off limits.  They are both grown up and the time seems to be right to act on their attraction. It was a good romantic book with a cute twist.  Worth the 1 hr read.",108,23

Trina and Hutch grew up together and had secret teen crushes for each other, but now years later meeting up again unexpectedly they wish to pursue this.  They sneak around and get a big surprise the morning after which forces them to decide to cool their affair.  Then things just get awkward until they come up with a temporary solution.

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,"Fast, enjoyable read. I liked both of the characters. Neither Trina nor Hutch are broken, running from something, or in need of saving. On the contrary, they are grounded adults who understand themselves and what they want out of life. Living out a fantasy from their teenage years doesn't change them, the goals they've set for themselves, or the passion they have for their careers. I found that remarkably refreshing. The ending, therefore, seemed realistic and hopeful. It tied up nicely, but remained true to the characters. I also loved the supporting characters and the subplot, which was well developed for such a short story. I'd like to read more in this series, and I really want to learn more about Robert and Lucy.",124,37

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,This is the first book I read by Vicki Lewis Thompson. This was way too short I think it could been a better story if it was longer.,28,42
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,"I read through this short romance story fairly quickly.  Hutch is a videographer who has returned to his hometown to help his widowed father run the store. While home Hutch runs into Trina who has come back home for a few days. They are both attracted to each other and discover that they both had feelings for each other as teenagers, but never acted on those feelings.  Now they have to find a way to make a relationship work as each of them wants to keep their careers where they travel a lot but they can't carry on an affair without some type of commitment as their families would be upset.

Overall I liked the story and characters.  I liked the surprise situation with the parents and I would probably read more to see how this relationship develops.  A quick read but it just lacked a little something, not sure what.  There is a love scene but it's not as graphic as some others.

At the time I downloaded this ebook to my kindle it was being offered in the kindle store for free, which in no way affected my review.",191,43

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,This is not a long book but it does cover everything that other romance stories have in less time. Trina and Hutch face a challenge of having a romance relationship while their window parents are together. They end up being under the same house doing the same thing without knowing for sure what is going on. I do think love has to be released to know if it is true or just a thing that will blow over. I enjoy this book because it was short simple and went straight to the point.,93,46

For one reason or another, I am still surprised to find out some of these aren't long. I should be used to it by now. Anyways, this one is a very quick contemporary read. Hutch is at home taking care of his father and his father's store after the death of his mother and Trina is home visiting her mother for the weekend. As the story tells it, Hutch and Trina both have secretly liked each other since they were teenagers, but out of respect for Trina's brother, they never dated or confessed their feelings for one another. They spend the weekend working out the state of their relationship and certain body parts in the process.

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,1.0,negative,"I don't even know how to start rating this book, its so not what I expected from Vicki Lewis, I was confused, If their parents are getting married would that make them brother and sister? and when they find out why not end the relationship instead of continuing something thats already doom?

I didn't enjoy this book, I almost didn't finish it ven though its a short story. Was very disappointed",71,49
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,It was really short so it definitely cut to the chase but it was kinda of cheesy and awkward. It didn't seem necessary to the series and I just didn't connect with this one at all. I did however like the preview of the next Sons of Chance installment that was the best part.,54,50

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,"I got this for free and it only took me about 40 minutes to read. I liked it. It was well written and focused on these two characters that always liked each other, but couldn't be together, so when they finally can, its great. I knew it was short and I got it for free so I have no complaints. I like this authors writing style. I'd be unhappy if I'd paid anything other than .99 cents for it because of the short length, but definetly worth reading.",88,52
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,"So, I read the reviews a little too late, otherwise I would not have purchased this book.  The story is short, knew that ahead of time.  However, it is just a little too short and too the point.  More like a quick description, not a developed story.  I could tell that the lead characters, Hutch and Trina, are obviously in to each other and make it pretty clear to each other right away. The book left me feeling like I had experienced a quick one night stand instead of a whole relationship.

I am not completely disappointed in the purchase, but am however glad it was a free offering.  I would have been quite angered if I had purchased it then found out how short and simple it was.",129,53
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,5.0,positive,"I'll start by saying that I'm a fan of novellas.  Short, sweet, and to-the-point books are perfect for my hectic schedule.  Already Home was a great novella.  Other reviewers commented on the abruptness of the book, but I think it was great when you consider the length of the book.  Looking forward to reading some of her full-length novels because her writing style was easy to read and enjoyable.  If the kids are down for a nap or you have an hour lunch break, read this.  It's a cute storyline about going home again and rekindling a romance with that one guy who you crushed on all throughout high school but never dated.  I think many readers can relate to that and will enjoy the exchange between the main characters.",130,54
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,3.0,neutral,"I really felt like these characters (the male hero is 30 at least, the female just two years younger) were mentally about 16 the whole way through the book. It doesn't help that the cowboy keeps remembering a time when he saw the <s>woman</s> girl in a bikini at the age of 15.

The two have come back to Wyoming for different reasons, bump into each other, realise they each had a crush on the other one as teenagers, and sneak back to his father's house to have sex. His father and her mother are also having sex, and are planning on getting married...

The immature dialogue, the sneaking around behind their parents' back, the concern about the heroine's older brother (the hero's best friend) finding out and getting angry...all too young for me.

The ending is more a HFN than HEA, which is fine with me (I don't require HEA in romances at all!) but it still felt rushed.

Despite all this, I probably would give one of the author's longer works a go, but this one didn't work for me. Too short, and with absolutely no story.",189,55
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,"I was disappointed with this novella. There was very little character development, the plot had no real storyline, and everything seemed to happen way to fast! There was no build up to events. Also, the ending was bad. Really, really bad!",41,56

Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,2.0,negative,"This was a disappointing read. The hero and heroine were likable, but a bit cardboard. Even the sex scene lacked excitement, and there was no romance to it at all. The ending was very abrupt.",35,61
Kindle_Store,B007H90BJM,4.0,positive,"After reading the reviews on this short story, I had to read it because of all the complaints about it being rushed, etc. Of course it was rushed, it's a short story! People, start checking the page count! Then you'll know what you're getting.

Already Home was a good read. Short and sweet---A tale about two people (Hutch and Trina) who have been hot for each other for some time, and when they get a chance to reunite, the sparks fly. The characters are likable and I couldn't wait to see how it was going to end. I wasn't disappointed.

One star? No way. I've read full-length books that weren't as good as this short story. It was well-written with proper grammar, and I didn't find one typo.

Give the author a break. It was a short story, for Pete's sake! Entertaining! Four stars!",144,62

It took me 10 minutes to read....it took longer to find the book and download it than it did to read the book.

I liked the story, I thought it needed more to finish the book.",23,56
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,"Like Katherine Hanna's terrific novel ""Breakdown,"" this shorter work creates a post-apocalyptic world that is extraordinarily atmospheric but not as central as the characters. (If you're a fan of Breakdown, you might want to know that in ""Work of the Devil,"" there's more action, some violence, and a more sci-fi feel, but the author shows the same beautiful knack for psychological drama.)

What I loved about this story was the wholeness of the created world, the relationships among the characters, and the tension within the young protagonist as he struggles with unfolding layers of hardship, deception, and horror. In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a village that has survived some unspecified disaster and evolved to be similar to the Amish of today--no machines, very traditional gender roles, etc. They also suffer from health and weather problems. In the course of the novella, a small group heads north to investigate and confront something that may be causing these hardships. Needless to say, they find it. The story opens at the confrontation site and uses a series of flashbacks to show how and why they got there.

This novella is pristinely written and edited, with high production values. Despite the darkness of the story line, the story would be appropriate Young Adult fiction. (I think the strong ethical center of both the protagonist and the story may have made me feel that way.) Another great piece from an emerging new post-apocalyptic writer!",241,0
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,1.0,negative,"After a long time it became clear the characters were Amish.  Suspense held for a short while and then it dragged on after finding the ""machine and creature"" .. Never explained anything about the sighting after it was found.",39,1
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,"I bought this after reading ""Breakdown"", hoping for another great read. I was not disappointed at all. Katy Amt Hanna has a wonderful gift for character-driven stories. The descriptions of people and landscapes are well done- rich and evocative without being heavy and wordy. She does an excellent job of conveying atmosphere and background, and then getting on with the tale. For a novella, 'Work of the Devil' gave just enough of a glimpse of the monster to tease and leave me wanting more detail about it. However, in this case restraint was perfectly played. The story is about the boys, after all. I can easily see this being made into a short film.",114,2
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,3.0,neutral,"The book isn't bad.  It's good enough to pass the time, which is kind of the point of a novella in my opinion.  It's not complex but also not boring.  You can pretty much tell how the story will go but like I said, it's not supposed to really be the most complicated read.  Buy it if you want something short you can finish quickly; i.e. for a plane or car (hopefully not while you are the driver) ride.",79,3
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,1.0,negative,"This story started off well.  I bought it because it was ""recommended"" as a book that might be to my taste.  Unfortunately, I felt the author either ran out of ideas or was too ""scared"" to make it scarier as should have been the natural progression of the story.  It died off pretty quickly and limped to a very mediocre conclusion.",61,4
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,"This was an enjoyable and unique ""weird western"" story with three dimensional characters and a solid plot.  Overall, the story needed some editing work.  The story isn't told sequentially, something someone must have told the author would make it more interesting, but it doesn't work at all.  Re-worked so the story was told from beginning to end and this would be a 5-Star short novel.  I still highly recommend checking it out, it is a great way to pass and afternoon and a magnificent effort.",85,5
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,4.0,positive,"Possible Spoilers!

This was a very good story.  I really wish the author had fleshed it out further.  I loved the idea that the boys would continue to search and destroy at the end, and I'd have loved to know more about the history and religion of the characters.  So many things were left unfinished, what happened to Aaron's father?  to Eli?  how did they do when they returned home?  ARGH!  I want more of this story.",77,6
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,"This is a neat little post-apocalyptic novella by the author of Breakdown.

It traces the adventure of Aaron,Ben,Eli and Caleb as they journey to destroy the ""devil"" - or what's thought of as the devil in their Amish-like community.
The devil is actually a large black machine of sorts (think the monolith in 2001 meets Stephen King's Gunslinger) that is suspected of shortening the life span of their community in the North. Meanwhile, Aaron must deal with the emotions of what happened to his mother: did she run away, as was thought, or did his own father have a hand in her disappearance?

The Work of the Devil can easily be read in a day or so, and I hope it's the beginning of a series for this talented author, for so many questions are left unanswered at the end of the book.",143,7

Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,5.0,positive,"Once you get past the first structual element of flashbacks, every section is riviting.
The book has two excellent climaxes. Once you think its all over when the machine is defeated,
the skill in developing the almost second story of Aaron's survival is extremely well done.
Most authors would stumble here and Aaron's story would be an anticlimax, but not AmtHanna,
she skillfully builds and builds again Aaron's return and the reader is once more absorbed,
Don't miss this second book from a rising youg author!",86,10
Kindle_Store,B008GV1THI,3.0,neutral,"The Work of the Devil reminded me of Patricia Anthony's books. While not alike in content or tone, both feel like nods to the classic SF tale of first (or failed) contact. This novella reads like a treatment for a full length novel instead of a complete story in itself. It would work better as a between book supplemental to an ongoing series than it does as a stand alone. Evocative, well paced and beautifully written, The Work of the Devil ultimately fails to explain itself. With more questions raised than answered the reader is frustrated at the end. Still worth exploring for it's fresh take on a time honored standard but I wish the author had dedicated a few more (or less) pages to her world building. The division between the world of machines and the world of simplicity is too stark with little to connect them.",148,11

It's just sort of tossed together.

There's nothing even homesteading specific in here. Just random gardening--and mushrooms!--information that looks like it's been garbled through an online translator. Nothing about animals, nothing about wisely using space or crop rotation, nothing that would actually be helpful for a backyard homesteader.

The formatting is terrible as well, with font sizes changing at random. It really looks to me as though someone whose first language is not English tried to compile some information without entirely understanding it and added no content of their own.

For example, here's the first sentence of Chapter 4:

""An organic topping that is utilized in the process of retaining moisture in garden soil is garden mulch which is organic.""

It's a bizarre word salad that doesn't really tell anyone much useful. If you were unfamiliar with mulch, would that help YOU understand it any better?

1) Change the title. Homesteading is a bell jar term that covers many different aspects of the activity and this short book only discusses the vegetable garden.
2) Though I'm certain the author has been successful in his own vegetable garden, the overview does not cover a lot of ground for its price. There is no mention of mushroom mulch, square-foot gardening, raised bed gardening and other aspects of raising one's own food that are considered standard for those forced to utilize a minimum space on a budget.
3) Where did the chapter on mushrooms come from? And though the title mentions wild edible plants, it only mentions mushrooms.
4) It would help to have the book reviewed by others to deal with typos and stilted sentences.

Nonetheless, there are some gems in the book, such as putting plants with specific water requirements together, the minimum amount of sunlight certain crops need, and though never worded in this manner, that the gardener raises dirt which in turn raises the vegetables.",201,18

She called me the next day laughing, with tears streaming down her face (so she said) telling me this was one of the best and funniest books she'd read in a long time.  She also said, it was way to close for comfort as she had experienced some of those calls over the 19+ years she had on the force. Can't wait until I can borrow it myself.",105,66
Kindle_Store,B009VSDN42,5.0,positive,The writer starts our with a short history of the 911 emergency system.  He than gives actual examples of some of the calls made.  The reader gets educated while enjoying many laughs.  You learn the trials and tribulations of the 911 operator.  You also learn some of the procedures EMT personnel use.

Grammar and sentence structure errors abound, so if this is something that bothers you, do not download this book.  It will make you crazy.  Redundancies like, ""we self extricated ourselves"" are another little quirk of this ""book"" that made me want to pull out my hair. At 27% in, the author actually just gives up on a sentence and lets it hang there.  ""The call receiver has a set of questions to ask the caller, and based on those answers the algorithm will""  - That's all.  The algorithm will.  No punctuation indicating that he INTENDED to end the sentence here, of course, and no hint as to what the algorithm will do.  I assume it will indicate to the ""call receiver"" which emergency responder to dispatch.  Fortunately, the whole mess took only about fifteen minutes to read, and now I am going to scour my eyeballs and go find a nice, well written book to soothe the grammar and editing beast within.",182,68

Add to that a scattering of typos and grammatical errors and a place where the narrative drops off altogether, and you have a disappointing product. The writer seems to try to compensate for scant material by inserting a smattering of educational material about the origins of the 9-1-1 system and its future directions.

The writer did communicate some important points, about what constitutes a legitimate 9-1-1 call and the consequences of abuse of the system. Most of the rest was drivel.",95,73
Kindle_Store,B009VSDN42,5.0,positive,"Between high school and college, but before matrimony, I worked two summers at a fast food place. Ambulance drivers would call orders in and give an approximate time for pick-up.
Sometimes they didn't arrive for their food, so we would put the whole bag in a warmer (ours was just past the meat slicer) and put drinks in the freezer.
Our business provided free drinks for every ambulance that called and any police officer that pulled in.
There were times these emergency personnel were laughing like school children. Now I know why.
This book gives examples of people who don't have much common sense. It shows that age doesn't necessarily impart wisdom.
Thank God the people who answer 911 have tact and a sense of humor.
My only  complaint is that the book is TOO short; that's the supreme compliment.

Kindle_Store,B009VSDN42,3.0,neutral,The book was interesting but lacked what I thought was or should have been the point of the book: 911 is for true emergencies.  The author may have been trying to do that in a nice way but most people don't read between the lines.  While some uneducated caller is tying up the system real emergencies aren't getting the help they need as quickly as they should.  In my opinion giving the reader the whole story might make them think twice before dialing.,83,80

Kindle_Store,B009VSDN42,3.0,neutral,"911 has saved many lives.  Butt there is a dark side of 911.  If you could not hear or speak on the phone, 911 could not help you.  Now NG 911 is coming.
This new year we can see the roll out of text to 911, something that would benefit those who cannot speak or hear, but also for situations like the Virginia Tech shootings where it was not even safe to speak on the phone. Imagine someone hiding in the closet and terrified to call 911 because if she said a word, her attacker will find her.  Eventually we will be able to communicate in voice, video, or text directly to the PSAPs and get help.

The book contains lamentably too few amusing stories of silly people who phoned in to the 911 call centre with less than emergency situations. What makes this book interesting is the information on how the 911 system actually works.

But Hank is actually the boss, but the author forgets that she must have renamed her characters and no one in editing caught this?  The stories are hoaky and irritating.

At one point, a character's mother is dead and then in the next chapter, the woman has moved in with them from a nursing home to help out with expenses using her Social Security.  First, Amish do not place their elders in nursing homes and second, they do not get Social Security payments.
I will not be reading any other books from this author.  The dialogues were laughable at best and totally unbelievable.  These people only go to school until 8th grade...you would not find them speaking to each other as this author would lead you to believe.

2.5 -3 stars

This was an interesting read with a small element of BDSM.

This instalment gives you an introduction to the characters involved.  I sympathised for Melita for the situation she found herself in.  She's confused, doesn't know what she wants and goes back and forth between Liam and Jack. Her outburst towards Jack made me laugh - she puts him in his place quick enough but this is the side of her I wanted to see more of as opposed, to the more reserved yet confused one.

Jack was an intriguing character, but his love for Melita wasn't convincing.  His sudden possessive and jealous nature was an interesting development but his behaviour towards her in the end was disturbing.",141,6

The book would have earned a five from me, but I had issues with starting to like Jack and he telling her how much he loves her, then the ending.

When she's told, do this & we can happy, or don't & we definitely won't be, then she has to try since she much rather have some happiness if she must marry him. I have to give Jack credit because so far he's been very nice to her. It appears he does want it to work especially since he's losing his bachelor status. That's even if he'll remain faithful. She is in love with someone else so she's pretty torn. At least she'll have someone to run to if she can't go through with it. An interesting change from most stories out there.",152,54

No bdsm happening in the book. I guess you have to read the next book for that.

She knows only what she read on google about him and he knows virtually nothing about her yet they are to m\be married in 6 months.  Her parents ship her off to his parents house like just so much baggage.  She knows virtually nothing about BDSM and further is a virgin.  I should have realilzed it was a series that it wasn't complete.  Melita was to marry a multimillionaire Jack.  I think it was probably to join the businessess of the families.  Jack was not a bit romantic with Melita and in a D/s or M/s relationship the couples work together to find limits and boundaries.  Yet Jack just sends her off to a BDSM school.

She's 100% vaginal and shaking like a leaf.
This author knows nothing of BDSM culture. It's horrible. Statistically speaking, a high-powered executive will more often seek a Dominant partner to offset the overwhelming control they maintain in business.
Asking a VIRGIN to be a Submissive is a no-no, unless that is what they're seeking.

I like to write reviews but it seemed somewhat pretentious that the author places in bold highlighting ""review when you finish reading"".  I am not impressed and I cannot say that I would buy the remaining books.

Sorry, Just not impressed.  Since this teaser is so short I am leery of purchasing the remaining parts of the story as I feel that I would end up paying a large amount of cash for pieces.",128,177

It's really hard to critique something when there is so little there (32 pages). For my taste I think that Melita just has no self worth and is very timid. But who knows maybe it will make her a good sub. But I doubt it. Plus its hard to digest that her family promised her to Jack. In this day and age really...? If there was a cultural reference that this was their way it would make it more believable. There just was not enough there to make me want to get the second part.

Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,3.0,neutral,"The Rock Star by Rick Soper is a very competent and intricately plotted novel. Perhaps at times too intricately, at least for my taste. It is obviously the first part of a series as a multitude of characters is introduced and their fates followed as they interact, cross paths and oftentimes antagonize each other.

Thanks to Soper's clear-cut style of writing, i haven't experienced any confusion, but there were times where the sheer number of different characters and each chapter shifting focus from one to another took away from my sense of enjoyment and immersion in the book. Some plot lines were more intriguing for me than others, and the wait to get to the next 'installment' was a bit frustrating, making me impatient and at times wishing to commit the grave sin of skipping parts of the text. Thanks to some tight plotting i remained innocent of that sin, as the action would have otherwise been difficult to follow.

I found the novel to be enjoyable, interesting and quite a competent piece, yet didn't experience the sense of pull to rush to the end, which i would have liked to. I do have to stress that this is in all probability due more to my reading preferences than to any failings the novel might have - because it really doesn't.",221,0

This book is fast paced and attention grabbing right from the start and it remains entertaining and action packed throughout. There were quite a lot of characters to keep track of, but this is a minor complaint in a book that has been carefully plotted to deliver fantastic shocks and twists as the story begins to unravel.

I could easily see 'The Rock Star' being made into a movie. It's such a brilliant book - the ending just made me want to read more so it's just as well this is only the beginning of a series! A thoroughly entertaining read full of mystery, horror, suspense & even a little bit of romance",135,1

I literally raced through to the end, only to find that it wasn't a standalone book, as a series would indicate. I was sufficiently hooked to purchase the 3 book box set so I could finish, (which I would recommend), but was a little annoyed at being misled. Luckily the initial book was free, and the box set was less than the individual cost of the last 2 books. I have now finished the first 2 books and started the 3rd, all in less than 5 days, so it has been a good investment.

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars, is the serial nature of the books, not the writing. If they aren't stand alone books, they shouldn't be sold as such!",146,5

Instead you read a bunch of chapters and new characters are constantly introduced as well as different POV's to make this a very confusing read.  This author shows an ability to write great sentences and uses punctuation correctly but the story itself is a jumble.  The sudden ending left a lot to be desired, it is like watching a TV series cliffhanger that you have to wait until the new season to see what happens next. I am not sure I am interested enough to purchase the additional books to find out how all the stuff in the first book tie together.  Perhaps if the books show up as Amazon freebies I may consider it.

Kindle_Store,B00A949GPW,1.0,negative,"I have just completed this book - and give it one star only because there is, in fact, a story trying to get out!

My first criticism is that there are far too many 'main' characters.  I would have needed to have carried a pad and pen in order to keep track of them all.  In fact there are new characters introduced for about the first 15 chapters!!

However, that all faded into relative insignificance at the 'end'!  I place the word in inverted commas for the simple reason that there was no end.  No conclusion; no drawing together of the various trains of thought; the whole thing had more loose ends than a large plate of spaghetti!  Of course, there was the incentive of the first few pages of the next volume - that clearly carried on from where the first one had stopped.  However, I have no intention of purchasing it - only to discover that I need to buy vol. 3 (ad infinitum/nauseum)!

My final criticism is the regular use of blasphemy - totally unnecessary, and offensive to many.  If Lee Childs can produce the Jack Reacher series (all highly recommended) without it, I don't see why Mr Soper deems it to be so essential!",208,11

You are exposed to ruthless killing--- you witness gruesome killing and burning of the victim-- you are taken through extremely well planned murder of personalities for their past crimes--you will enjoy the cleverness of a hacker into FBI.

Each plot gets a couple of chapters and then you switch plots. It makes it hard to follow, especially since there are no apparent connections for the longest time. You have a gruesome murder to start with, a serial psycho who maims people for their crimes, a reclusive rock start who wrecks on the beach and finds a new talent (singer/songwriter) with a mysterious past you never find out about, and a group of drug dealers that are mixed up with Russians. Toward the end of the book, there are minor connections being established - Russians meet rockers, common hometown of victims, etc. but nothing substantial. You have a missing girl in the first plot, and the last chapter is the discovery of her mutilated body, and then the Amazon ""Please don't go without offering your review"" page pops up. It was very unsatisfying and irritating. I love book series where characters continue and become like friends you know, but this was ridiculous. It has potential, but I will not buy the next book to be left hanging this way. A little resolution in the plots would have gone a long way to making me go back for more.

Commas in the middle of sentences, commas before the last word in the sentence, commas just willy-nilly for the sake of adding commas! Note to editor, a comma indicates a pause, which is very disruptive when not used properly. If this book had been formatted properly, proper sentence structure adhered to, and the stories had wrapped up, I would have given it a much higher rating.

I downloaded this for free and was happy I hadn't spent money on it. There are way too many characters and at the book's conclusion, you know very little about any of them.

Beginning with the gruesome discovery of a burning body on the Carmel beach, multiple stories are set in motion, and Soper's skill keeps each moving deftly ahead. Of particular interest to me is the flawed FBI agent Jon Stevens, having read two earlier works about him. Agent Stevens sometimes pushes things a little farther than you want your public servants to, but he's at a point where rules and playing nice are not as important to him as saving lives.

The chilling, hinted-at summation of the burned body mystery caught me off-guard. I truly didn't see it coming, and I don't say that often.

It was definitely not a beach read - more like an algebra equation with plenty of variables to solve and exponents to grapple with. This book is for the engaged thinking reader.",90,69

He has a thankless job & seems to be the right person to do it. I'm curious to see how this bit ties in with the rest & who exactly it was who attacked the Erie Morningstar.

This makes me question whether buying this whole series makes any kind of financial sense - but that't something you need to figure out for yourself.

This episode seems to have nothing at all to do with the characters we met in The B Team, although I'm sure there will be a smart tie-in at some future point. I appreciate that, unlike the Kindle Serials, the author doesn't spoon-feed you the plot, and you have to make connections on your own. This episode could thus be read entirely on its own as well - I'm not sure why you would want to though, since, as stated above, it's really really short.

This episode comprises of a transcription of a conversation between the colony leader of a wildcat (rogue) colony and an uninvited guest - a crew member from a spaceship who was made to 'walk the plank' and landed up, heavily injured, on the colonized planet. The transcription/dialogue idea is an intriguing device, and I very much enjoyed reading this episode, in spite of its by now well-documented brevity.

Part 1 (The B Team) is a pretty decent length, a fully contained story, and essentially a good pilot episode for a series. I eagerly looked forward to the next one. But then part 2 is so different. It is very short, has none of the primary characters, and reads like s script excerpt (it is intended to be a trascript). So it is a VERY brief read and I can see people being annoyed. Myself, I have no problem taking it as a single chapter in a book. Thrilled with the previous chapter and quite happy to read along and see where it all goes. And for those of you claiming it is some sort of money grab, please, chill out. The publisher sets the prices, and I would not be surprised if .99 cents a release is the minium price.

Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"I enjoyed this section of The Human Division. The reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the price, compared to length.

Instead at a dollar per chapter, the price comes out a bit higher. I can't say that I haven't enjoyed reading them, and I don't feel ripped off, but the length compared to price is a bit off.

I like what John Scalzi is doing here, but I hope if he tries this again we get a bit more bang for the buck. All that said, I don't regret the buy at all. If you're a Scalzi fan, or a fan of The Old Man's War, you should absolutely but this collection.",143,30

I read the first book in this series and found it a good read even though it was a little short. This book had nothing to do with the original story and was so short I was stunned when I was done. Is that all!!! I read it in about an hour. This is a rip off. They are trying to get you to pay twice as much for a book by putting out episodes. All thirteen books would probably only equal the length of a regular book. Don't buy this series. I am done with it and anything written by John Scalzi",116,38

Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"This second episode of The Human Division, Walk the Plank, was not what I expected.

This one picks up on a story not involving anyone in the first episode. This is also rather short and can be easily read in 15-20 minutes. Maybe less for fast readers.

But don't let the length fool you. In many ways, I enjoyed this episode more than the first. It's written purely in dialogue with the loan description being that a door opens or closes. Since it is dialogue, it's written more like a script for a TV show than a short story. So each line of dialogue is preceded with the name of the character and a colon.

A pretty good story is told, despite no narrative. This surprised me, because I expected at some point the ""script""like approach would stop. It never did and at the end I felt it was a satisfying story that hints a little more about the unknown group that is trying to disrupt the peace of the Colonial Union.

I recommend you give this one a try. You might feel $0.99 for this short of a story is unreasonable, but I think it fits well with the episode format.",202,40

God bless him for writing Old Man's War, it was truly inspired but this is an overt attempt (albeit clever @ .99 a pop) to wring a little more juice out the series.

It almost felt like a high school writing prompt that the author didn't have time to finish in class. Then, why did it get three stars instead of one or two?  It was not poorly written.  It had characters and storyline that left me wanting to know more and read more-and that counts for something.

Releasing one chapter at a time is a delightful little scam - getting $15-20 bucks for  a six dollar novel; but you better keep my interest every click of the purchase button.

These are so good! The first one really piqued my interest, and I liked the second one just as much.

Walk the Plank is a transcript of a discussion following a injured stranger turning up at a Wildcat colony, called New Seattle. The stranger tells his story about how his team were practically made to ""walk the plank"" when they were attacked by an unknown enemy.

Walk the Plank is a good story on it's own. William Dufris manages to portray all the pain in the injured soldier's voice, and I'm curious how this little story will fit into the rest of the episodes. Very curious! It took me a couple of minutes to get used to the transcript style, but I enjoyed it a great deal and found it easy to follow.

However in this piece the story is way too short (less than one hour of reading) and lacking real substance. The first installment of the series, albeit short, was a complete story with a beginning, a middle and an end. After it, this story feels almost like an insult:
- it throws you right in the middle of things leaving you with a set of questions one might hope to get answer to by the end of the story (only you don't)
- there are no twists, no plots, nothing just a short narration coming to its predictable end.
- when the narration stops you feel like you have more questions than at its beginning. Who attacked and why, why didn't they attack the colony, what happens to the colonists without resources, etc.
- there are only 3 characters thrown in there but really only one actually gets some stage time.
- it's way too short and ends abruptly. So much so that when you turn the last page, you can't help but wonder: that's all???
- last but not least, the price tag. Too much for too little. I don't mind paying for quality but this is hardly it.

One of the things I like of the eBook short stories is the length. I never know when the story is going to end. This is a disadvantage when I have to work the next morning, but great for maintaining suspense and interest. So I am not paying for X pages, I am paying for an interesting story.

UPDATE: have now read through chapter 8, and have a little better opinion of this chapter and the series.
It's not a traditional novel in the sense that these are chapters in ongoing plot and/or character lines. So far at least, each chapter stands on its own as a short story, or maybe vignette is a better word. There's a thematic tie between them - the Colonial Union needs allies, and somebody doesn't want them to succeed in that - but there's no real plotline(s) or character development. Some characters make an appearance in more than one chapter, or are referenced, and the same with events in previous chapters. There's no traditional narrative though. It's sort of like Tales of the Colonial Union, the Treaty Building Years.
Whether you like this approach or not is up to you. It's not bad once you accept it for what it is, but if you're looking for another Old Man's War, this isn't it.",212,91

Nearly all of the written science fiction I've taken in has been in one-and-done novels and short stories, or in decade long book series'.  I'm genuinely enjoying this modern experiment in story telling, and excited each week when the next installment comes out.

That said, it's been great so far.  People may complain about the length, but I look at it a different way:  I'm not paying Scalzi by the word, I'm paying him for the story.  If he deems that this is a worthwhile, singular chunk of a larger story, that's how I'll judge it.  So far the story as is has been worthwhile and a hell of a lot of fun.

I hope the experiment succeeds!",128,103
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,3.0,neutral,"The first episode was very exciting, fast moving and full of believable science.  The second episode was good, but it was also disappointingly short.

Nice experiment, but it doesn't match my needs.",59,104
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"I'm a fan of Scalzi's work, he makes me think and he tells good stories. I am enjoying this new experiment of his, with this book released in episodes.

This is very short, especially after last week's long introduction, but I was OK with it, because it was very different. The fact that it was told completely in dialogue was at first jarring, but I realized as I read that i didn't need the description of the setting or the action, because I *knew* what was going on. I have read and watched enough SFF that I had a pretty good picture of the people and the place, and that came both from my own imagination and from the word's the characters were speaking.

Did I want more? OF course, but then, I knew what to expect, since it's been very clear that some of these episodes would be quite short.

I think it's disappointing that people choose to rate books on things like the price, rather than the merit of the work itself. Also, I think that saying $0.99 for this is too much is disrespectful to the author. You can reread his words many times, you can't redrink the cup of coffee that you probably paid more than a dollar for.",213,105

The first installment (double length) got me fired up to follow Scalzi's new format into this Human Division saga.
""Walk the Plank"" was a great read and left me wanting to the turn the page for the next chapter in the story.
Having to wait a week only builds the anticipation.
As Scalzi has commented on his on blog ""Whatever"" for those that don't enjoy the concept of purchasing a new chapter every week; the compiled whole will be available for purchase in a couple of months.
Enjoy the read as a chap book or wait and buy the whole thing but certainly take the opportunity to avail yourself of this fun read.",134,107
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"Yes, it was short and not as complete as the first story, but from what I understand these are meant to be ""episodes"" - not self-contained short stories - and that is just what this felt like to me.

Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"(POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN) A little annoyed with all the negative reviews citing how 'short' the episode was. It's an episode, folks. Not all of them are the same length, as they serve different purposes. It's like complaining that the chapters of a book aren't a minimum number of pages. Especially considering the format, which is a 'found footage' technique useful for adding some mystery to the narrative, one would expect it to be shorter. It seems to be setting up things that will be expanded on later in the book.

What I liked about it was it allowed me to flex some imagination muscles in picturing the scenes as they might look had there been descriptions included. As a transcript of some dialog it allows for interpretation of what's going on, and so adding suspense for what's to come, rather than describing things in detail. This I find exciting and engaging. I don't require an author to explain everything, all the time, up front. It's a mystery that I'll be coming back to to search for clues after reading more of the whole story. What's important to me is that it has information to deliver about the narrative as a whole, and we won't know WHAT it actually has to offer until we get further into the story.

And I'm sorry to be grumpy, but it's US$0.99. You can't expect to take reviews seriously when they complain about a getting their money's worth.

If you are worried that you are being ripped off, keep it in perspective. I suspect the other installments -- including the first one that you've already READ -- won't all be in the same format or length.",281,109

Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"This look into an unauthorized wildcat colony in the ""Old Man's War"" universe is hinting at the major players to come. In the first episode, we have a story much like the tales John Scalzi is known for, ""Walk the Plank"" abandons that storyline completely with all new characters, and completely different story telling techniques, but you get to peek behind the curtains of the crisis looming. I think we will find out more about the mystery evil doers, and maybe even some of the colonists in the near future.

Overall it's well worth the $1 to buy it. I have heard reviews arguing the price is too high for a short story, and I saw some people paid more than a dollar.  I would say that I did pay a dollar, so you shouldn't pay more than that. But is it worth a dollar? Let's looks at things today I bought that were more than this story? Coffee, a diet Coke, a Snickers candy bar, parking, and a loaf of bread. I would take this story over any one of them.

If you don't like the price? That's fine, but don't complain about the product. Just wait until the compiled series is released as book, or wait for the paperback, or wait for the library near you to get it.",221,111
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"This is not a complete story in the traditional sense, but rather an episode in a serial novel and should be considered as such.

I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous episode, but that's as much for the unrelenting bleakness of this tale as anything. On the whole, it was well-written, but left me wanting. I think the biggest problem I had was that by telling it as a transcript, Scalzi wrote away from his greatest strengths and it shows. I find it is his narrative voice that really works for him as an author, and as this episode had no opportunity for him to showcase it, the results were weaker than they might otherwise have been.

I would not start with this, but I can see how it is likely to prove one of the most important episodes once the entire set is released.

Don't worry about the price, it's less expensive and more fulfilling than a candy bar or a soda, so go ahead and splurge.",170,112

But at 38 pages; I had it read before my coffee was cold.

I know .99 cents is not much money, but it adds up quickly when each series is less than 50 pages. You end up paying too much for what should have been published as a single novel.

It definitely made me look forward to the next chapter!",95,117
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"I am really enjoying this series.  This is a fun way to release a book...one chapter at a time.

If, like me, you enjoy the suspense each week of waiting for the next installment then, by all means, join in and buy this episode!

This second episode ""Walk the Plank"" comes after a two-part first episode, so by comparison it feels a little bit short.  Some folks seem to be upset that the second installment was too short for the 99 cent fee.  I don't think that's the right way to look at it.  I think of it as paying for a hardcover book in 99 cent weekly installments spread over a few months.  As a reader, it is the same money spent in the end, so I don't sweat the chapter lengths.  Some chapters will be long and some will be short.  That's how I want it!  I'd hate for authors to adopt a too-rigid chapter/episode length format (like TV) and force stories that would have been better if shorter or longer in to some standard length.

I both thought the format was overly limiting and went unexplained (there is no context for showing the short story as a voice transcript) and also refreshing for being new.  I'd have rather seen a tale of survival from the survivor's point of view, but I trust Scalzi to amaze me later.  I liked it, but on its own it was not much.  As it leads into something else, though, it is a good chapter.  So, four stars.",100,122
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"Note: I reviewed on Audible as well.

This episode of John Scalzi's new Human Division is written in the style of dialogue from a recording between a leader of New Seattle, a small colony on a harsh world, medical staff, and a stranger who has a harrowing story to tell. It's the stranger and the classic sci-fi elements of his troubled story that makes this episode so enjoyable. While shorter and not following directly from the earlier ""The B-Team"" episode, the story is a strong vignette in its own right, and in tandem with part 1, builds a wider sense of world that I'm looking forward to exploring.

I recommend the audio reading as well -- the voice work adds great atmosphere.",122,123

Second, I will say Walk the Plank was a bit short for me. I'm the kind of guy who gets to the end of a Neal Stephenson book and goes, ""Oh, that's it?"", so I might be a bad judge of book length.

Third, from a story perspective, if you read 'The B Team', there's an intriguing twist here that takes the plot in a direction I wasn't (for once) anticipating. Don't worry, I won't spoil it, but I am now more excited to read #3 in the series. At the end of this, I was surprised that it was over and very very interested in finding out what happens next. This is a good thing in a serial series of books, don't you think? And tangent, isn't it great that Scalzi isn't going all GRRM and making us wait a presidential election cycle before publishing the next part of the series?

If you're worried about this being too short for the $1... well, I can promise you that it'll take longer to read than it will to eat a $1 item off the McD's Dollar Menu. If you're, for some unknowable reason, going to only buy ONE of the stories out of this serial then yes, this is not the one to get if you want the most words per penny. If you're buying them all, as I intend to (unless it all turns to crap in the upcoming editions) then I'd say just view it as an average rather on a per-edition basis. Or wait for the collection.

As far as I'm concerned this was an excellent interstitial after last week's setup. I know a tiny bit more about what's going on and the state of the universe and have a whole lot more questions.",180,127

Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"I liked episode 2. There have been some complaints about length, and no lie, it's short, but it's a nice example of how this episodic format may play out. Scalzi uses the short episode to try a format you couldn't get away with in a full length (seriously, it would be exhausting to read) but it works to convey a short, brutal story in an engaging way. I look forwards to seeing how this ties together with B-Team and subsequent episodes.",81,129
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"For fans of Scalzi's world, this should be a fun little introduction to a wildcat colony and perhaps a couple of characters who will (hopefully) play a larger role in the rest of the book.

Getting it in this small of a chunk was a bit frustrating, but if I didn't want to put up with that, then I'd wait till the whole thing comes out in May or so.  As is, it's kind of nice getting this in bits and pieces, especially since I tend to devour pulpy (and Scalzi, while a good and fun author, definitely veers into the pulpy side given his books' lengths and lightness) novels in a day or two.

Scalzi's said that buying the episodes separately will end up costing about the same amount as buying it all in one piece at the end, so I don't really get complaints about bang for the buck.  The main downside for me is ending up with a bunch of separate little books on my Kindle, but I'm hoping there will be a way to convert it at the end.  If not, I've had worse problems.

It raises more questions than it answers and if you have only read the first story in this book, its reason for existence would be opaque.

While I admit some disappointment in ""Walk the Plank"" (due to its short length and narrative format), it was entertaining. Furthermore, I'm intrigued to see how it will fit in to the over-arching narrative. Unlike ""B-Team"" (which stood almost as a short story), ""Plank"" definitely felt more like a chapter in a longer novel (it reminded me somewhat of the opening chapter of Scalzi's ""Ghost Brigades""); it seemed somewhat disjoint, but you have to trust that it will pay dividends later.

Upon reflection and re-reading the story, I have to revise my feelings. The chapter is significantly different in style and emotional impact. ""The B-Team"" could stand alone as a short story and as such was a satisfying read. ""Walk The Plank"" is a much darker chapter in a larger story that is yet to be revealed. The writing is as tight and expressive as anything Scalzi has written but it leaves me wanting to know more about what is going on. I am impatient with the one chapter a week release schedule and would prefer to read the whole novel in one go, but I don't want to wait for the complete novel.

I can't wait for the next one so I can get some more context, but I appreciate Scalzi's daring in making this his second episode and I hope readers don't give up on the episodic format too soon- I'd love to see more novels come out this way!

I know we're still in the opening act of this series, but I didn't see much relevance to a larger plot and was mostly bored throughout this read.  I'll still try the next one or two before abandoning the series.  I'm a huge fan of the universe and Mr. Scalzi's other works... I'm nervous though.",119,137

I like that Scalzi is willing to try different formats (ie. dialogue only, and ""episodes""). The book market has drastically evolved in the past 5 years and I applaud him for looking for ways write in the digital age.

I look forward to the role this story will play in future episodes. Read it, read all of Scalzi's Old Man's War books if you haven't yet. Then go read everything else he's written.",119,138

For all the one and two star reviews complaining strictly about the length of ""Walk the Plank"" while saying nothing of the writing...um, this is a small part of a larger whole. Every single episode is going to cost 99 cents and the lengths will vary. If you can't handle the fact that one or two vignettes/episodes will be significantly shorter, wait until the whole thing comes out in one volume and pay one lump sum.

Something I have always liked about the way J. Scalzi writes is how he can show the reader something poignant, something to rouse emotions without having flashing arrows pointing the way declaring ""This is where you're supposed to feel those rusty heartstrings getting pulled! Don't miss it!!!!""

Malik's predicament and that of the wildcat colonists are both desperate in their ways ( I do like seeing some info about the wildcat colonies from the Old Man's universe!) and the mind goes to dark places when considering the unknown enemy who would discard their victims in such a way...

Sure, the initial installment was much longer but aren't there always longer pilot episodes or season finales or special guest star ones? I don't have a problem with the length of this, especially considering it cost me $0.99. A candy bar costs $0.99 and does not last anywhere near as long as 32 pages of interestingly written fiction.

What I really enjoyed most about this episode was that Scalzi has made it clear he's trying something new and it really shows here. This is not written like a regular short story or novel, but rather reminded me very much of screen play with much less information. As such, I was able to create the show in my head while reading along. At first, I will admit that I was put off by the style but then I realized when I was done that I enjoyed it a lot more than I first gave it credit.

This is how he has always written his fiction, and it is something I greatly appreciate. Those bothered by the length are perhaps unaware that this is how short fiction should be written. That is what this book is, a collection of short fiction that will come together to form a novel.",82,149
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"I've liked all of the Old Man's War (OMW) series of books (as well as the short stories) since I came across them 2-3 years ago.  Walk the Plank is an interesting entry in the series - it follows a small set of characters that have yet to be seen in the OMW universe who are all on a wildcat colony.  The wildcat colonies have come up in a number of stories, but we've never had a wildcat colonist as a point-of-view character before.  While the connection between The B-Team and Walk the Plank is, so far, tenuous at best, I expect as more chapters are released, we'll come to see a stronger connection between Harry Wilson's story and the other goings-on in the OMW universe soon.",127,150
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"Yes, this episode is shorter than the first one (which was so long that it surprised me!)

It is, however, a great illustration and reminder of the various colonial situations out there in the ""Old-Man"" Universe.

I found this second installment of The Human Division, Walk The Plank, completely captivating. It had a different voice and POV than The B-Team, it introduces a new (completely pitiless) menace, and also tells us something about life on a remote colony. As a fan of reading and writing and watching serial episodic stories, I was completely happy with this and can't wait for The Human Division #3.",105,153

Although on its own, it's definitely not a complete story (more of a vignette), I'm always intrigued to see content generators trying something new!

This one was a heavy story, but gave great slice of the very dangerous nature of the OMW universe. Can't wait for Ep3!",79,154
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,4.0,positive,"The second entry in a serialised delivery effort is very different from the first. While The B-Team read very much like a short story, Walk The Plank felt much more like a chapter in a larger book... Which is exactly what it is.

Without giving away any detail on the story I would describe Walk The Plank as a tool for building intrigue, which it does very well. I finished it with the thought ""just what is going on?"" and very interested in reading the third episode. The style of delivery of this chapter is also a little different, which is well supported by the focus on perspectives of the core characters.

A thoroughly enjoyable episode of The Human Division, which raises questions and sets the stage for more action.

A note on the one star complaints: The focus of a review should not be on the length of a book (or even film, album etc) but on its quality and the enjoyment experienced, if any. So while they are not wrong about the short length of Walk The Plank please do not let that stop you from giving it a try.",192,155

Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"Caveat emptor, if you have been living under a rock: This is the first chapter of a new book in John Scalzi's ""Old Man's War"" series (OMW, Last Colony, etc.). The author and the publisher are trying something different here, it appears: a nod back to the Good Old Days of the serial (fitting, given the ""golden age"" feel of the tales). So, just to be clear, you are not buying a book, you are buying a (pretty self-contained) chapter in a book. Yes, you can buy a book later, if you want to wait.

That said: A great new installment in the series. This is an offshoot of one of Scalzi's short stories (""After the Coup"", and I recommend you look that up as it is a fun story). New character's, same universe. Good characters and good start that has really given the series a fresh start.

Like military SF? Recommended. Like hard SF with a touch of comedy? Also recommended. Like Scalzi? That's a no-brain (PAL) er. Recommended. Can't wait for the other installments of the story.

With this second installment, we get past the (re)introduction of our team of character's and get into what will be the story's direction. Downside? I have to wait (until tomorrow) for my next fix!",213,157
Kindle_Store,B00AF62EW6,5.0,positive,"I really enjoyed this entry in the Human Division. The concept of serialization has been around since the time of Dickens (indeed, most of his works were published in serial form), but has fallen out of favor since the primary mode of literary consumption became the printed book.

Scalzi has noted *repeatedly* that the episodes vary in length. If you think you're not getting your money's worth from this episode, you're certainly getting more than your money's worth for the other episodes, particularly the B-Team, which was originally posted for free. It all averages out.

I think this episode would have suffered if more had been added to it. The writing was fantastic and for a story that was nearly entirely dialogue, there was a LOT of information and context provided in a very subtle way, which can be difficult without expository details.

TL;DR: Quit b*tching and remember that you are participating in literary history, in more ways than one. GOOD STORY.",162,158

It made me want to read the next episode right away.

I would suggest that those who dislike the price/length ratio just wait a few weeks until the compiled edition is released; then it will be ~$12 for a full-length novel, and all of this pointless fretting over the cost per word rate will be irrelevant.",95,159

I'll have to see what people say about episode 3 before I determine whether or not to spend the time and money.

This installment of the story is related in an ""audio transcript"" format.  At first, I found it somewhat awkward to read, but it didn't take long to get used to it, and in the end, I felt that it really worked well for the story.

There are a few details of the story that are left to the reader's imagination.

I didn't notice when I ordered Walk the Plank that it was only 32 pages. That's less than a half hour of reading. At this rate, serializing at once a week is more that a little too infrequent.

Walk the Plank provides no context. Those of us who've read the Old Man's War understand the implications of a Wildcat Colony and there is a too brief allusion to what one is in The B-Team, but readers new to John Scalzi's fiction aren't going to have a sense of what this sliver of a greater whole is all about. One wonders why 250 people would be trying to colonize such a hostile place anyway. The picture painted in the B-Team is a union of sparsely settled but serviceable worlds that surely don't match the hardships of 15th century Europe. What's the motivation for risking becoming a rerun of the Jamestown Colony?

This episode (it really can't be called a book) also doesn't have an ending. The colony leader is a hard nose; the doctor is sympathetic; the survivor from the space ship is doomed; there's a person recording conversations, but the reason for doing so is unspecified.

Kindle_Store,B00AN6H4UA,2.0,negative,"I have always thought ""urban legends"" were those stories like ""cancer-stricken child wants to collect postcards from every zip code in the universe"", or ""snakes crawling up through the toilets of New York City apartments"".
What I have read of this book (about the first 20 pages) seems to be all about ghost stories and horror stories teenagers pass among themselves in small towns, like the one from my hometown, where, if you went down to a certain railroad crossing, at midnight, you could see a headless train man bearing a lantern along the track to signal to the trains, or, the ones passed among girls at  pajama parties, about the maniac who attacked young people who were parking and then discovered they were out of gas -- I always wondered if that one was just to keep girls from avoiding the dangers of going parking.

If you want ghost stories, get this book. If you want urban legends, look elsewhere",161,18

The male lead is a rich womaniser with a death threat lurking in the background, an overprotective streak and a tendency for violent outbursts.  He meets poor misfit girl who happens to also be pretty and they emark on a kinky but intense relationship.  If this sound familiar, that's because it is.

Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,"I wanted to give this 3.5 stars. I did not love the characters, but I did not hate them. I seemed to really like Kennedy and Ayden--would love to read their story.

I think my issue with the story were the characters or possible the plot. At times I found the story to be confusing. It all over the place. As if it hopped around a lot -- it was back and forth and not enough meat in the middle. It started out pretty good and than fell flat in the middle and then the end picked back up again--just enough to make me what to read the second book!

Now when Stefan stepped on the scene--I thought OMG! Caramel eyes?!?! DARK HAIR!!? Normally its all blue eyes guys in books. Now I LOVE ME some dark eyes on a man and dark hair! I thought YUMMMYY! But than I read he SMOKED?? GROSS---a MAJOR turn off for me. Its a nasty habit that stinks and I just could not get out of my mind how much he prob smelled and tasted like smoke- Yuck.

Overall it was a okay book and it left a cliffhanger, so I will be reading book #2!",203,8

AT this point, I don't know if I care.  I never got to really get involved enough with the characters.  For a first book by the author, it was ok.  Hopefully number 2 in the series will get better.  I'm sure it will be.",107,9

I read A LOT probably a book a day and that's not an exaggeration so I've come across a bad book a time or two. I can honestly say this book was absolutely dreadful.

Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,Good story line and left me wanting more.  Can't wait for the next book.  I did knock a star off for the grammar errors.  It is one of my biggest pet peeves and I found myself having to re-read sections because I couldn't ignore the grammatical errors.,47,12

Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I am really excited to read the next in the series.
As I understand it, this is the author's debut book. Well girly, you have done well! I have read many books along the lines of this genre. I really liked how this book was focused on the relationship between the main people, and didn't allow the romanctic scenes to over power the story. Too many authors are trying so hard to catch the FSoG train, and they forget about the main relationship. While there is a lot of heat in this story, it isn't another copy cat book. The author did a really good job with balancing the relationship emotionally and physically.
This is a must read. I hope the next book comes out sooner rather than later. If the author wouldn't mind writing the next book while still basking in the success of this book, that would be very much appreciated. ;-)",160,16

Seriously, who gets hit over the head and is unconsious, bound by a crazy ex-lover, and then (I'm not kidding) 10 minutes later gets into bed (the same bed you were about to die on)... then the whole thing is forgotten. By everyone including the main character.

Too many story flaws to finish.",101,20
Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,3.0,neutral,"Ok, so I just finished it and I liked it. There were a few plot problems and there was a couple of character characteristics that I was confused about. I thought Stefan was one way in my head and then he would turn around and get all ""naughty"" on us. Don't get me wrong I like naughty but he just switched around on me some. Jen, I liked ok. I didn't LOVE her character, she held some frustrations with me. She jumped to conclusions too many times and I wanted to holler and scream at her to just shut the hell up and listen...

Ok, now to the good. I absolutely loved Kennedy and her awesomeness as a best friend. She was there for Jen time and time again, no questions asked! The story picked up for me three quarters of the way through and as soon as I thought I knew where she was headed, I would be completely dead wrong...

I don't like predictable and it wasn't. The ending very much left us with a ohhh and ok a 2nd book will be coming in the near future which of course I will definitely for sure have to read. I will need to know exactly what C.N Watkins has in store for these characters.

I see major character growth & development for the next book and it can only get better from here!",235,21

Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,1.0,negative,"OK..What could I say about this book then that it was a cheap imitation of ""50 Shades of Grey""  It duplicated most of the story line, the only difference, that is in another city with different names, and bit of a twist when it come to the story line, but more or least is the same thing.. The dominate young millionaire guy who has a distraught past (Stefan)...Stefan love interested is Jennifer, the only difference between Jennifer and Ana from 50 Shades was that Ana was a virgin.. So for those of you that had read ""50 Shades of Grey"" and want more, this is the book for you..You have a crazy X with a happy gun on hand.. Mr. hot millionaire buying all the good expensive toys for Ana, ""I mean Jennifer"", like the expensive car, the black berry, and of cause the masquerade ball and so on and so on..and Mr. hot and sexy Stefan, just like Christian Grey, he love to play with handcuffs and foggers, well you get the picture..Also the story was rushed, that I felt I was about to have a sprained neck..It when from one scene to the next in a blink of an eye..The only thing missing was the ""Red room""...But then the book isn't finish there is a part 2, so maybe in the next book we had a red room or a blue room, who know ^^",237,23
Kindle_Store,B00ANZ7LDQ,4.0,positive,"I fell hard for the cover art first, GUILTY! Second was the character Stefan.

Jennifer and Stefan meet while she is almost a college graduate. Stefan is a very young millionaire building his empire. Their relationship reminded me of the movie Intersection, the way the character Richard Gere (Vincent) falls for Lolita Davidovich (Olivia) - just that whirlwind feel their relationship had (not the entire movie or theme/plot) Stefan is used to having his way in all things and does not like to wait. Jennifer on the other hand likes things her way but for different reasons, she has a shield up. Stefan does not let that shield hold him back. He goes after what he wants --Jennifer. Jennifer is very much taken with him but she isn't about to be controlled. That doesn't last long with Stefan.

Their relationship has its twists and turns from a bit of fatal attraction to some Dominant play.

My reason for only 4 stars is at times the story felt hurried. I would of liked to know more about Jennifer's story surrounding her mother and father. We only get little bits that almost drive you crazy but in a good way. I am assuming there will be another book that will answer some of our burning questions?!?!

I hope that Kennedy and Ayden get their own story, they were strong secondary characters, it would be great to see where they end up. With that said I am wondering what the author has coming up next...

I downloaded it for free so I've little to complain about but my advice: spend a dollar or two ( or go to the library) and read something worth while because this is just a waste of your precious time. You can't even use any of these facts to impress your friends since most are either so obvious that you'll bore them to death or something you'd need to research to be sure you're correct (or risk getting embarrassed by your better educated friends).",142,4

I came upon a half-dozen ""facts"" that were utterly inaccurate in the short section of the book I read, which is totally unacceptable.  If the author wants to stand by the things he wrote, he really needs to add a whole slew of footnotes and attributions. If he can't do that, then the honorable thing would be to return his profit to anyone who bought the book.

Then there's the hideous grammar and spelling. If the author graduated from high school, he got the diploma simply because he aged out of the public school system. My daughter was a better writer in grammar school than this person who charges for his incorrect ""facts."" OTOH, if the author is in elementary school and this is his first try at creating and self-publishing a book, then he deserves some gentle correction and a stern warning not to upload any more ""books"" until an adult has looked it over first.",203,7

  As far as the book goes its an easy simple ready with some cool facts, however, there are so many mistakes in the typing that it could not have been proof read. I don't know if ifs just on my kindle or what, but so many words run together no spaces and a lot of errors like that. It has a very unprofessional feel to me because of that. It still delivers what it offers but for some reason it bothers me. Otherwise not a bad book. The facts are in small chunks with a title. For example the title might be Coke or Watch etc...

Crystal is a Kindle Short, short means not long; it was ninety-nine cents for Christ's sake (we can get a lot for ninety-nine cents these days) and if it had no depth, then having your life decided by your mother and backed up by an institutionalized god and then you rebelling against that edict is one of life's shallow experiences.  I thought the central symbol of the story compelling, the portrait of John and the piggish Father Ryan devastating.  To me, it read like a Greek tragedy.  Images from the story will linger in my memory for a long, not short time.",141,0

Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,The story itself was very good but it was too short.  It would have made a better novel.  I felt quite dissatisfied at the end as there could have been so much more depth to the characters and the plot.,40,4
Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,"Despite the negative reviews, you should give this story a read. It's spare in its style, never wasting a word or an image.

An young Irishman is drawn to priesthood by the sheer will of his mother. What are the consequences of breaking free?

There is an old saying among priests: ""the true test of your vocation is if it outlives your mother"". In this story,a young, unhappy priest finds he can't wait so long.",75,5

Still he takes the ride to the seminary, though it felt ""like a hearse.""

I found the short cameos of John, his family, and his friends to be lovely.  The story of the priest at war with himself is told in clean, sparse language.  The despair is conveyed without drama, but with depth.  I recommend this story.",112,7
Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,1.0,negative,"I have never written a poor review before, and it pains me to do so, now, but I simply cannot give this story a favorable review. I am so disappointed, because I love stories about the priesthood, the ""calling"" and the sacrifices people called to that life make.

But this story fell flat on so many levels.

Firstly, it was poorly written. It was very choppy; there was no flow, whatsoever. It bounced around so much that I had a hard time keeping track of which character the author was talking about, or where the character was.

There were times when the author seemed to change direction, mid paragraph. It was almost as if she had lost her place or forgot what she wanted to say, but kept on writing. There were scenes that went nowhere; they just trailed off...

Secondly, there was little to no character development. I knew no more about the main character at the end of the story than I did in the beginning.

Lastly, I found the protagonist's life changing choice at the end of the story to be totally unbelievable. He makes a decision that forever changes the path of his life over something so minor, most people would have considered it an annoyance, at the most.

Throughout the story, there is frequent mention of another character, a woman who is a friend of the main character's sister. She is mentioned enough that I believed she would play a large role in the main character's life, and in the story, but then she just seems to disappear.

I realize it is difficult to build characters and wrap up a plot in a very short story. Perhaps this was a story that begged to be a novella.",292,8
Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,2.0,negative,"The story line has a leveled beginning that is an excellent vehicle for development ; unfortunately, it just sits there. If the setting has significance,, it is obcurred by ""passing"" references to bucolic pastoral senery  followed by swift shifts to the worst examples of post-industrial age urban decay. The characters are static' and even the main character remains single-dimensional. The introduction of the mystery woman offers several opportunities for adding depth to the priest's character, but this woman just fades into the background with no evident reason for introduction.

I am still waiting for the significace of the crystal.",99,9

Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,"I'm assuming the negative reviewers are used to reading standard popular/genre fiction. What makes this story interesting is the motivation of the characters, not the plot.

This is the first time I've read anything by Susan Hill and I plan to read more of her work in the future.",72,11
Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,3.0,neutral,It was a quick read. I do like a good short story after a few long novels.  Because of the brevity of the story not all characters were as developed as they could have been.,35,12
Kindle_Store,B00AR0K2TM,4.0,positive,"No one really thinks about the loneliness of a ""calling"", mainly, I guess, because it usually is someone else's life we are discussing.

It is all well and good when it is your calling and your heart is completely given over to a life of solitude and sacrifice.  But, as in this case,when it is some one else's call on your life and you accept it out of a sense of duty, it seems that it would be intolerable.  This young man finally had the courage to leave while he still could.  How ironic that he must live with guilt and end up so alone.  This was a well written and very unusual look at the life of a young man who finally had the courage to do the right thing, only to find that it was too late. Starkly honest!!",141,13

I noticed that the only reviews he posts are for the games made by Nice Games, and they are all pretty much the same. Either he's being paid to post reviews, or he is the developer. Problem is, the games by Nice Games leave tons to be desired and are very amateurish...they are easily the bottom of the barrel when it comes to apps for the Kindle Eink readers.  I have learned to avoid the games by that company because they're not even good enough to be worth 99 cents.

Vidal makes it clear in his afterword that the book was inspired by a brief conversation he had with John F. Kennedy in November 1961.  Kennedy wondered why we had no great men of the caliber of the Founding Fathers in his own time (how depressed he would have been had he lived forty more years and witnessed our present crop of ""leaders""!!)  Vidal doesn't really give us a clear answer to Kennedy's question, but he does manage, in less than 200 pages, to remind us of both the Founders' human frailties and their greatness.  With Vidal Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, and many others don't come out as icons, but neither are they the villains some would make them.

Of particular interest is a fascinating afterword spoken by author Gore Vidal. In this relatively short book, I noted that the page count of the print version is 198; Gore Vidal attempts to place his literary arms around the efforts of those three principal actors in our early national drama Washington, Adams and Jefferson. This is by all accounts a book of non-fiction but I find his style very similar to his fictional prose - extremely fascinating and sometimes very frustrating.  That comment is based upon my limited reading of his historical fiction: ""Burr"", ""1876"" and ""Lincoln"". Trust Vidal to highlight some the historical oddities that can challenge our uninformed assumptions:

Washington gallantly waiver his salary as commander of the Continental Army but after the war submitted his bill for personal expenses of $100,000.

Our bloody enemies, the mercenary Hessians, married local girls Western Pa and Delaware hence the many German family names found in those areas.

Vidal broaches the rumor the Hamilton was Washington's illegitimate son. After all GW did visit the Bahamas once.

The anti-Catholic Pope-hating Yankee Protestants thought an invasion of Canada in 1776, let by the redoubtable Benedict Arnold, would be a resounding success. After all would not the Popish Frenchmen rally around the New Englanders against the British oppressors?

Vidal has a keen facility for discerning the eccentricity of human nature. His insightful observations breath life into the Founding Fathers. A fascinating read or listen, recommended.",255,5
Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,"Gore Vidal's historical novels give me enormous pleasure, and so I was looking forward to this book and to learning more about a very important period in the nation's history.  It certainly debunks the conventional myth (especially cherished in the state where I live), of great statesmen producing a divinely-inspired constitution which has never been bettered, and probably never can be.  I am not a good enough historian to judge the accuracy of Vidal's account of the infighting and self-interest that lay behind the facade, but it is a plausible and very entertaining tale which provides an incentive to explore the topic further.
However, there are two defects which spoiled the book for me.  One is minor:  my hardcover copy suffered from bad editing or proof-reading, or both, and contained too many immensely long sentences which seemed to have lost their verbs or perhaps even a complete line and punctuation, so I was frequently re-reading to try to extract the meaning.
The other, to my mind, is fatal:  the incessant acerbic attacks on present day (i.e., 2003) politicians, especially the Bush administration and, in some cases, on Dubya himself.  Of course future historians will puzzle over the attacks on constitutional rights that followed 9/11, and why the public tolerated them, but the causes and appropriate responses to real or perceived terrorism are complicated and contentious;  this is an issue that needs greater perspective and much deeper analysis;  the snide comments in this book are more of a superficial and irrelevant distraction than a serious contribution.  The final three pages, recounting a conversation with JFK 40 years ago, seem purely snobbish name-dropping, although they also give Vidal space to observe that thinking is something ""no longer done in public life"".

He has some flair for the dramatic interactions (whether exaggerated or not) among characters (the three main, Hamilton, Marshall, Franklin, etc); however, they are not developed or enriched with further explanation.  I, giving him two stars, grant him the benefit of the doubt that he had to ""INVENT"" the nation with only 177 pages, but this is far too limited.  He emphasizes discord and elements of struggle for one principle and its inventor over another rather than collaboration among fellow patriots.  Clearly, it is important to see the contrast of one party and patriot against the other, but it is overemphasized, or just not fully explained to give any nuance.  He is strictly secular in the ""invention"" of the nation, which for me, limits it further.  Altogether, if you've started reading it, by all means finish it.  If not, skip it.

While that may be in the book, the book is primarily an anti-Bush diatribe.  I am not one to defend President Bush but I can not stand intellectual dishonesty.  In the book, Vidal states that invading Canada in response to 9/11 made as much sense as invading Afghanistan.  While the issue of invading Iraq is and continues to be a controversial one, there has been very little opposition to our invasion of Afghanistan.  Our current President Obama has stated many times that our fight against terror was in Afghanistan and not Iraq.

Jefferson's ""philosopher king"" act was a front for a self-delusional aristocrat, as Gore Vidal makes clear.  It's too bad - I was hoping for a better glimpse of Jefferson and what made him great.

This book is stale and tired.  In depth, it is not much more than ""1776! The Musical"".  Vidal has not kept up with research on the founders, and his characters are more like caricatures.

Vidal is oblique and wordy, making me wonder... what does he *think* he is talking about?  He seems to obscure his meaning deliberately, dropping hints and insider jargon, making vague generalizations.  Perhaps if his readers realized what he was trying to say, they would accurately conclude how poorly-formed his ideas are.

In the end, you sincerely hope that this was NOT the best Vidal could do.  You hope this was an ignorant and indolent slurring of history, put forward mainly as a way to get the publisher's advance on the book, rather than the best product of his highest ideals.

He guesses at motives, or makes them smoothly fit into his ideals.  The more I read, the more insane Vidal became.

Yes, Vidal does cover his historical data well and even having read other works recently about the same era, I did learn new things. However, Vidal also uses this text as a forum to inject some of his own political views through partisan commentary on current events. I understand our past colors our future and vice versa...but I wanted a book that covered the scope of history, not one that told me how we were all modern day heathens in the throes of sending our forefather's turning in their graves at the disgrace we've become. :) I don't agree with all of Mr. Vidal's current day political positions and having to be beat over the head with how horrid we've become and the despotism of any one not in line with his personal political views got tiring.

Perhaps other authors have made these men mythical, but Vidal returns them to the human species.  They were men who made mistakes.  None of them were perfect.  However, I think Vidal is overly negative in his viewpoint of these men.  They founded a new nation with great principles.

The author jumps around quite a bit in this history.  He also has some new history with the revelation of Hamilton as a British spy.  I think the author came to that out of his own conclusions.

Walking a fine line between respectful praise and candid revelation, Vidal introduces Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton and others as no history professor probably ever has. This book is not a slam biography of anyone, nor is it one of those tedious lambasting of our national institutions that too often masquerade as ""warts and all"" history. No, Vidal shines here in this story of the events behind the time-worn legends in early US history.

I personally found much to like in this book and discovered a last gem hidden in its closing pages, as Vidal describes a moment of relaxed conversation with his friend and distant relation by marriage, President John F. Kennedy. On that day shortly before the President's brutal murder, Kennedy turned to Vidal and asked how it was that  so many great men all lived at once in the generation that formed our nation. Vidal's one-word answer was unique and while as he freely confesses, not comprehensive, it was good, and it's left me pondering it on more than one occasion since I read it.

But to Vidal, everyone was and is of sinister or selfish intent...except his friends, the Kennedy's (and Ben Franklin.)  That's just the feeling I got.

Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,3.0,neutral,"""Inventing A Nation"" is Gore Vidal's witty and  irreverent look at the three main characters, George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson who, together and in competition, invented the United States.  Reporting the contributions, strengths and faults of each, Vidal carries the early years of our country from the Revolution through the Louisiana Purchase and on to the end of the Founders' Era, with the death of Adams and Jefferson on July 4, 1826.  Besides the three main characters, the reader also gains insights into the roles of lesser players, such as Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Aaron Burr and John Marshall, particularly as they shared scenes on the world stage with the main characters.

I found this book to be both entertaining and irritating.  Vidal's unusual ability to turn a phrase keeps this book moving along.  At times Vidal suddenly shifts from events early in our history to current political topics.  Vidal has a way of presenting his impression of current issues as universally accepted fact.  An example of this is his leap from a discussion of the Alien and Sedition Acts of the Adams Administration to contemporary anti-terrorist laws, which Vidal sees as similar infringements on civil rights.  This I find irritating.  I did gain some insights into new ways of viewing individuals and developments in this portion of our history, although I can say that I found other books to be more informative.  Because the new material was relatively sparse and the cheap shots at modern policies so irritating, I seriously considered giving up on this book before completion, something I almost never do.

Vidal covers the forming of the Constitution, inaugral Presidential terms of George Washington, and the subsequent battle for succession between the Federalist (Adams, Hamilton, John Marshall) and Republican (Jefferson, James Madison) factions.  Hamilton's story is perhaps the most colorful - Vidal insinuates that he is Washington's illegitimate son and accuses him of subterfuging John Jay's postwar treaty with the British (repeatedly labeling him Agent Number Seven) and sabatoging Adams' political career.  The book also explains several important events of the early republic like the Alien and Sedition Acts and Marbury v. Madison.  Vidal includes quotes from vintage letters and other sources but also peppers the text with critical screeds against the current administration and its policies which may distract or annoy some readers.

A passage from Senator Maclay's diary describing Thomas Jefferson  in 1790 also fits Vidal's book: 'He spoke almost without ceasing.  But even his discourse partook of his personal demeanor.  It was loose and rambling and yet he scattered information wherever he went, and some even brilliant Sentiments sparkled from him.'

He focusses on the first three presidents: Washington, Adams, and Jefferson; he, however, gives supporting roles to Hamilton, Madison, and Monroe. Vidal does not move chronologically, instead he jumps through events, granting him freedom to pursue his prose style.
He covers all the major incidents in the life of the young nation. Filled with lots of history and biographies, enlivened with acerbic commentary, one learns from this book.

In Inventing a Nation, Vidal challenges us to confront some of the unpleasant parts of our past. He infers rightly that the Founding Fathers, after the Revolution, became the very evil they were fighting against; however he concludes wrongly that this resulted in a contradiction. I beg to differ. The Nation magazine, which I believe prides itself on supporting freedom of speech, in a recent edition chastised fastfood companies for dishonest advertising. To them it is no contradiction. I do not fault them, neither do I fault the founders.
There are other remarks I oppose in this book. Like in page 136, he claims that the Electoral College thwarts the majority rule, and is therefore undemocratic. This is true, yet it is not right. Because it is possible for the majority not to represent the nation. I would rather prefer the Electoral College than Tocqueville's 'tyranny of the majority.'

What must be appreciated is that the experiment the founders indulged in was debated on intellectual, even ideological, grounds.

This recent offering is a colorful and human rendition of our country's formative years.  The interplay between the giant figures of our nation's birth (Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Marshall, and others) is fascinating, and illuminative of our contemporary struggles.  And rather than come down decisively on one side or the other (Federalists vs. Republicans), Vidal is careful to lay out the nuances of each position (although Hamilton does come off as a main villain, in many ways).

Perhaps most intriguing is the dynamic of Jefferson's trust of popular wisdom.  He expected the American constitution to be torn down and rebuilt quite often, as scientific discoveries added to the great body of public knowledge.  After all, who wants to be in thrall to a beclouded past?  Franklin also expressed the view that if unchanged, the political arrangements of the United States would result in a course, cruel, and unjust society.  As recent times demonstrate, theological devotion to a piece of parchment scrawled by a hoary generation can result in social and political ridiculousness.  We perhaps need more Jeffersonians and Franklinites today, who are willing to jettison cheap patriotic fealty to the founding fathers in favor of a renewed trust in popular power and wisdom.  We clearly could use a new constitution, updated for the concerns of today.  The present version was conceived as a protector of privilege, and it functions the same today.",251,27
Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,5.0,positive,"Gore Vidal's witty, snide, snobby, sarcastic style of writing is very entertaining and even his critics have to admit he knows his history.

In this short, quickly read book, he demonstrates beyond doubt that our nation was founded, not by saints, but by a vast array of men with mutiple interests, visions, egos, and agendas. The miracle is that a flexible system of government was forged from this complex interplay of lofty enlightement philosophy with base ego centered self interests.

Vidal brings historic characters to life with tiny details, for example Abigail Adams becomes disqusted when Benjamin Franklin's mistress feeds her lap dog from the dinner table. While Washington is urging that the flimsy Articles of Confederation be replaced with a Constitution, he and his mother have a falling out. The book is full of these personal touches that bring the historic characters alive in the mind of the reader.

The team work of these early founders, despite their disagreements, was fantastic. Adams charmed the Dutch while Jefferson and Franklin charmed the French.  The genius of Hamilton and Madison is balanced with the exceptional political skills of Washington.

I am always amazed when conservatives attack Gore Vidal, since he is an advocate of maximum liberty of the individual, and he will viciously criticise FDR with the same venom he would use against George W Bush.

The reader is left with a feeling of wonder and amazement that our principals of government have survived despite the folly of many a generation of politicians. Vidal would have us recognize that we must remain vigilant and skeptical regarding our nation's leadership and direction.",270,28

But he doesn't do it with the usual swift stroke that many authors take when they're trying to glorify historic figures.  Instead, he shows that these people were flawed and had their own personalities and agendas and egos.  But they did some great things, and he conveys that through a series of anecdotes.

Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It didn't feel like any type of propoganda, just a patchwork of stories.  It gave me insights into those characters of the early history of the Republic.  I would recommend it to anybody who would like a conveniently sized, easy-to-read book about the characters in American history.",191,29

Historians are not writing history, they are in a manner of speaking, collecting and reporting on history as it was written. I would not recommend this book as a basis for understanding this period of time (Try Benson Bobricks - Angel in the Whirlwind, or McCullough's - John Adams). This book is history according to Mr. Vidal.  His references to modern day events and persons are more an indication of his political leanings, than his connection of current events with events of the past. You can not understand the present by making moral judgements on historical individuals since they did not have benefit of your understanding of the past, conversely, they had no understanding of what was to come.

If I want politically charged opinion on the topics of the day, I'll read Op/Ed pieces, or at least something that admits its bias from the onset.

Vidal writes with a keen awareness of the present as he delves through the past of this great nation.  Almost every line has some sort of resonance with the current disastrous political situation our Republic finds itself in and also gives us some clues as to perhaps why we are in the mess we are in.
Despite all the partisan issues some other reviewers may gripe about, I found Vidal's work to be fair and very moderate in tone.  He calls them as he sees them, and if there are jabs at our current presiding government thrown in, they are all by virtue of historical truth.

By peering at the past, we gain a better understanding of the current political climate, and ""Inventing a Nation"" is a glorious testament to our founding, colored as it is by Vidal's astute observations and insights.",78,34
Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,"Gore Vidal, in his _Inventing a Nation_, turns his attention to the first three Presidents and the politics of the young United States.  The in-fighting, back-stabbing, manipulation (and in some cases, outright treason, as in the case of Alexander Hamilton) between the emerging political parties are discussed in great detail as are the personalities of the ""founding fathers.""
Wih this panoramic background Vidal has several points to make.  That the nation was have today is not at all what the creators of the Constitution would have imagined, that we Americans have surrendered many of the liberties given us by the founding fathers (to the courts and corporations), and that the ""democracy"" we imagine we have has, in fact, never been so.  I assume this is intended to provoke thought and reflection by readers, which it does.
But Vidal also has an ascerbic side, bordering on contempt for the common American when he asserts that most Americans have no idea what the ""electoral college"" is, that the nation has gravely erred by attempting to ""export"" democracy (beginning with our enterance into WWI and continuing to our current ""war on terror"").  Vidal also bitterly (perhaps justly so) decries the relequeshing of Congressional power to declare war to the executive.
At the Constitutional Convention, an elderly Ben Franklin remarked that we have a democracy, if we can keep it.  Vidal argues that contrary to the intentions of our founding fathers, (who also battled similar issues) we have been unable to keep it.  Certainly a thought-provoking read, but it is sure to anger some.",260,35
Kindle_Store,B00AZHYN9M,4.0,positive,"I would recommend the purchase of 'Inventing a Nation.' The main selling point of the book is Vidal's unbeatable style. You already know who the players are; 'court historians' have already identified them for you, in gross detail. Two of them adorn Mount Rushmore, gazing at a country that today they might find very strange indeed. (John Adams didn't make the cut for Mount Rushmore, I guess you would have to ask Gutzon Borglum why . . .)
What the court historians don't generally do is make an effort to cast the Founding Fathers as human beings, remarkable as they were. In this book, we read about Washington's financial troubles with his mom, Jefferson's uneasy working relationship with John Marshall, and Adams' never-ending correspondence with his wife Abigail.
Along with Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, Vidal takes time to embellish the margins of his portrait with sub-miniatures of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, James Madison and the ineffable Talleyrand.

I've also taken into account some of the earlier reviews posted here.  I agree it's not his best work; I'd save that distinction for LINCOLN and the UNITED STATES essays.  However, it is a very thoughtful and funny piece of work.  Vidal INTENDS you to think about what he says.  There is more to history (at least there should be) than just getting the dates and names right.  If you want the life of Washington read D.S. Freeman or J. T. Flexner.  If you want John Adams, go to David McCullough.  If you want Jefferson, see Joseph Ellis or even Dumas Malone.  Those are first-rate biographies.  However, what Vidal attempts here (generally successfully) is the second part of history - how does what they did reflect now?  What present events suggest we haven't come as far as this founding trio would like? (See his comments on the relationship of Adams' Alien & Sedition Acts to the Bush Patriot Act.)

I was expecting more personal information about RG3.  Instead it was more about the league itself during the 2012 season.  RG3 was not the only rookie quarterback profiled as much print was given to Andrew Luck.  A lot was also written about Michael Vick and Tim Tebow as they continued their struggle to find a place on an NFL squad.  So this book was more about the season than about just one young QB.

I think I knew this book was going to disappoint me when I read about RG3 choice of Baylor.  The author did not know why he chose this non-powerhouse school stating, ""We may never know.""  I wondered why the author did not just ask Griffin why.  So as I read the book, I noticed never did the author interact with Griffin in order to write this biography.  Instead he reviewed game film, interview transcripts, and league stats.

Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"Quite honestly, before I read Robert Griffin III: Athlete, Leader, Believer, I had never heard of Robert Griffin III. I rarely watch football, except for an occasional Nebraska Husker game on TV. That said, I wanted to review this book, because I desired to learn more about football and be inspired by the faith of a popular athlete.

The book met one of my expectations by teaching me a lot about football. Ted Kluck described Griffin's life objectively, and showed the challenges and responsibilities of being an NFL quarterback.  He revealed the strategies of several teams, compared athlete statistics, recounted the Redskins' 2012 season, and provided a football jargon appendix.

While I was impressed by Kluck's in-depth football description, I was disappointed that the book lacked spiritual emphasis, especially because it is being marketed as a ""Christian"" book. Kluck avoids talking about Griffin's theology. He briefly compares humble Robert Griffin III's witness with that of outspoken Tim Tebow. From there, readers get to decide which method of witnessing from a public platform is more effective. In some ways, this subtle approach to discussing faith is a nice contrast from some ""in-your-face"" Christian books I've encountered. However, the way in which it was marketed is misleading.

In summary, Robert Griffin III: Athlete, Leader, Believer is an objective book about NFL football with subtle mentions of faith. I probably won't read the book again. However, I'll probably recommend it to my brother and some of my NFL-loving friends.

There is also commentary on various teams and other quarterbacks in the N.F.L. In his criticism Kluck is brutally honest, the Detroit Lions are listed as a Gong-Show organization for example. Reading this was a great way to learn more about an engaging player who revived a team that was disregarded as boring. Toward the end of last season RGlll was out with a knee injury. This year Sports Illustrated is predicting he will be awarded the comeback player of the year. I found Appendix A on quarterback rankings to be the most entertaining and subjective part of the book.

However, if you're looking for an inspiring testimony of a young man before he became a Heisman Trophy winner, you may want to wait for that book to release.

Finally, the book isn't bad. It's just not what the title implies.

Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,2.0,negative,"I've been a football fan for as long as I can remember. I've been a Christian even longer. When I had the chance to read about a Christian football player, I couldn't wait. I was disappointed, however, in the content of this book.

With a title like Robert Griffin III: Athlete, Leader, Believer I expected to read a book about RG3. I thought the book would talk about his roles as an athlete, leader, and believer. I was wrong. While not badly written, this isn't a book about RG3. It's a book about the history of NFL drafted quarterbacks. There are sections in the book about RG3, but you could easily cut those and replace them with information about Andrew Luck without having to change more than 25 percent of the book.

With this title I expected an interview with Griffin, his parents, coaches, and teammates. I was looking for new insights into the man, but there's no original information - just quotes from other sources - and very little of it focuses on the quarterback. If you're looking for a history of NFL quarterback's, this is a great book, but if you want info about Robert Griffin III, however, I would tune in to ESPN.

Kluck goes where few authors go, looking into schemes and strategies of different teams and demands of being an NFL employee. His knowledge of football schemes and the NFL are refreshing for readers. As he diggs into RG3's background and faith, readers come to know the man behind the mask an appreciate the honors he has achieved and position he has earned.
This is an excellent book for football fans. You are left investigating the current status of RG3 as well as other quarterbacks around the league.",114,7
Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"Like everyone else I thought this book would be more focused on Robert Griffin III's life but it wasn't. It focused more on his life evolved around football. Like how he made Baylor into a program where others would want to come and play at. This book also talked a little about how his father would train him growing up. I would have liked to hear more of those stories. This book also covered a lot about other NFL quarterbacks, and how RG3 matched up with them. There wasn't a lot of his faith but how he uses different phrases.

Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"I am not a huge sports fan, but I enjoy biographies, autobiographies and the like so I decided to give this book a try.

Prior to reading this book, I didn't know who Robert Griffin III was. This book tells parts of the story of his rise to fame, after being drafted by the Washington Redskins. However, this book doesn't solely focus on RGIII - it also includes details about other running quarterbacks such as Bobby Douglass, Michael Vick, Tim Tebow, Vince Young and others.

While the book was interesting and offered a variety of sports facts (and generalizations, such as RGIII's infamous socks) - it wasn't quite what I was expecting. I did learn that RGIII attends the church founded by David Crowder and considers himself a post modern Christian.

My 16 year old who *is* a sports fan?  He's devouring this book!

In the back of the book, there are some play and formation diagrams which totally lost me. The football glossary was helpful but again, this wasn't quite the story I thought I was going to read.

I didn't feel like I learned more than surface details about Robert Griffin III so I wouldn't suggest this book for those wanting a pure biography about this player.

For sports fans like my son?  Absolutely.",216,10
Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,4.0,positive,"Author Ted Kluck knows pro football like a true addict--all the players, their strengths and weaknesses and their stats. Like many others, he recognizes that Robert Griffin 111 may be one of the best rookies to ever play football.

Robert Griffin 111, in his first year as a pro quarterback has gained team leadership and respect from everyone who knows him. The big question: Can he survive inevitable injuries to fulfill his potential?

Kluck compares RG111 to others on several levels of skill. He also relates major games play by play, high-lighting RG111's and others abilities.

For pro football fans the book is exciting and informative. Even for non-educated in the nuances of the sport, the book will be lively reading.",121,11
Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"Robert Griffin III: Athlete, Leader, Believer is obviously a biography of Robert Griffin III the now infamous (at least to football fans) rookie quarterback for the Washington Redskins.  This biography was written during the 2012 football season so the information is a little sparse.  There is a little bit of background information regarding his time at Baylor and a little bit about his family life and his relationship with his father.

However, I felt the book basically just retold the 2012 season and didn't give much information that wasn't already being shown on ESPN or given during time outs at the games.  I felt the author should have dug deeper into the past as a way to connect the success Robert Griffin III was experiencing.  Also, if you do not know much about football this book would be very confusing to you as there is a lot of football garb used especially in the beginning.  I realize that people who are not football fans probably won't be reading this book but just in case.

Overall, the book was good but lacked interesting depth.  It was a quick read.

Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"ROBERT GRIFFIN is a book on football that features ROBERT GRIFFIN. It really is to early in his career to right an extensive biography and because there is no ""dirt"" to speak of the book is more succinct hitting the important aspects of RGIII's development as an athlete.
I don't know what I expected, particularly since I am a Baltimore Ravens fan and not a real knowledgeable one.  All I knew about RGIII was that he was a man of faith. What I learned after reading this book is that he is a man of faith and family.
I would not discount the book so quickly though. Ted Kluck has established a foundation as to who ROBERT GRIFFIN in contrast to others in his profession. For the novice football fan, of which I consider myself to be, the book gives insight into how great athletes are developed. Furthermore, parents who have dreams of their children leading their team to the Super Bowl will learn the difference in guiding and pushing.
As I said I am a Raven's fan, I was once a Washington Redskin fan many many many years ago. My job never allowed me the luxury of following any sport to closely and my interest prevented me from memorizing names and numbers of athletes of any team (except the Redskins back in the day).  There is a lot of football history written within the pages of this book and that is what makes it worth the read.

I received a complimentary copy of this book .",257,14
Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"Loved this book!  More then just learning about RG3 I actually learned a lot about the current state of the NFL.  Truth be told I am much more knowledgeable about football back in the day, probably about 10 years ago.  I absolutely learned so much.  This was not only an excellent analysis of the game in general, but the realities of the game today.  It was interesting because I was expecting more of a biography of him, but it really wasn't.  It talked more about his career during high school, a little bit about how his parents chose to raise him.  Ted Kluck is extremely knowledgeable and the way that he is able to write - whether you knew about football or not you would be able to read, understand and enjoy this book.  Like I said it really was a comparison of RG3 and many players of the past and present, comparing how the game was played then and now, and similar ideas.  No one can argue that the game is vastly different then back in the day, like basketball and baseball.  It is difficult to explain more without giving away the book.  I would recommend this book for your husband or son, whether they are a fan of Griffin or not.  This is a great football book in general.  And while ""faith"" is including in the title, this isn't really a book about faith or necessarily the faith of Griffin, so don't let that concern you if that would make you hesitate in getting the book.

I gave it 3 out of 5 because well I probably wouldn't read it again, or read it over and over again.

As a former athlete and a leader in my career, I thought that I could walk away with some new ideas how to lead in the workplace.  I don't want to say I was disappointed in this book, but I did not walk away with anything of value.  I feel that the book did a great job of providing a general overview of RG3's first year as a NFL rookie, but overall, there was little more than a brief section that provided details of his leadership abilities and how his beliefs impact his role as an athlete & leader.  I'll give the book 3 out of 5 stars because it was enjoyable, but I cannot give it 4 or 5 stars because I felt slightly mislead by the title.",155,17
Kindle_Store,B00BOTZE5M,3.0,neutral,"RG3 is ostensibly a biography of Robert Griffin III, the young, exciting quarterback for the Washington Redskins.  As much as any rookie needs a book about him, Ted Kluck does a nice job recapping his college career and examining, in depth, the great majority of his rookie season.  Kluck breaks down some of the signature plays that Griffin and the Redskins ran so successfully, and gives glimpses into what made Griffin into the man and player that he is (although he is still so young).

However, the book didn't really seem to be that, exactly.  It is a look at athletic celebrity, especially early in a career.  It's a look at the NFL quarterback position, particularly as it is now as the game is continuing to evolve. It also looks at what defines success for a pro quarterback now and in the past.  There is a particular focus on the ""running"" quarterback and also a look at leadership. Finally, Kluck discusses the importance of ""branding"" for an athlete, and how public displays or proclamations of faith might play into that.

As a book about RG3, RG3 does a passable job.  Most of his rookie season is still fresh enough in my mind that I don't feel it really needed to be written about yet.  However, as a book taking on the changing roles of young stars and the position of quarterback in our society of immediacy, RG3 succeeds at a high level.  My favorite parts were the examinations of how quarterbacking is changing, and how different quarterbacks compare.

I wouldn't really recommend this to the casual fan, but readers looking for something a little different in the way of looking at the NFL would enjoy this book.

Then it ends and you have to buy the next book and the next and the next and the next and the next just to finish one story.  What a pitiful way to get more money.  Big authors actually finish a book for one price.  A sequel is a continuation a of different character's story or year's later.  You don't write a few chapters and call it a book.  It makes people angry and not want to buy your next ""series"" because they will have spent a fortune to read one story.",104,64

Kindle_Store,B00C2V4W2W,2.0,negative,"This seems to be a short story/novella ebook exclusive from established author Tom Harper but I don't know why there has been no marketing for it - perhaps the publisher are doing an experiment.

It's about a British student named Paul specializing in Ancient Greek religion and working part time at the Zurich Museum who encounters a pair of unusual art collectors, Ari and Valerie, after closing hours at the museum. They bribe him into convincing the private owner of one of the twelve Orphic tablets that the museum needs to photograph the artifact, a plausible request since the museum had previously done some work on the tablet. But of course Ari and Valerie have ulterior motives and there is a nagging feeling that they were already familiar with Paul's educational and working background and deliberately targeted him.

Unfortunately, it was very lacking and left me with far too many questions. I still don't understand what Aphrodite has to do with the Orphic tablets. Harper is an excellent author and I've enjoyed his full length novels but I don't think short stories suit his style.",185,40

Kindle_Store,B00C5HYEY4,4.0,positive,"This story had a lot of potential and could be a really great novel but it still needs some work. 5.99 is really too much for this product as it is.  The author should offer it for .99 until it is edited and rewritten and then he might offer 2.99. There was an excessive amount of spelling a grammatical errors such as right - write, mettle - metal, etc... I think that with just a modest rewrite and a decent edit that might correct these errors and some of the stilted sections then this would be a really great work.

Note: The author says that he has edited the work as of 4/14/2013 so, although I haven't re-read the book, I will add another star for a total of four stars.",131,0

Kindle_Store,B00C5HYEY4,3.0,neutral,"Normally I don't review books I haven't purchased, but I do have an opinion on how indie authors should present their works.  I'll admit that the title and product description (if you ignore the typing errors there) sound like it could be a promising read.  However, based on what I see on the existing reviews, and see for myself in the rather short book description, the author was not able to get even a few sentences cleanly written to represent the book the author expects prospective customers to pay a good bit of money on.  If this was a freebie offering to generate interest, or a $0.99 purchase to test the waters I wouldn't have thought anything unusual about it.  $5.99 is rather steep to hand over on an unknown when there are plenty of other very good authors who price their indie books at half that.  I do occasionally purchase ebooks at the $5.99 price point, but only if it's from an author that I know for sure writes a good story.  I also expect very few grammatical and editing errors if I plan to spend that much on a book.",192,2
Kindle_Store,B00C5HYEY4,3.0,neutral,"The first sentence & paragraph made me laugh. It is poorly written with no punctuation. However the second sentence and last sentence in the first paragraph truly say something about this book.

Indeed I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise. Read the book to find out.

Finally (hysterical laughter) if you care about grammar or spelling or really bad substituted words avoid this book . A few examples of substituted words are ""meddle instead of medal"" and my personnel favourite ""finely instead of finally"" repeated over & over and over again.

That said the author has a unique perspective on life and I enjoyed the book.
After the first chapter the book rapidly improves. The pace of the book is ok and the story gets interesting after the first few chapters. Escapism fun.

The author has his quirks. Boy does he ever. But it adds to the fun.

The ending was a bit too fairy tail for my taste.

Minus 1 star for the grammar & poorly substituted words and minus 1 star for the lame ending for a total of 3.

Cheers",183,3
Kindle_Store,B00C5HYEY4,3.0,neutral,"I have mixed feeling about this book.  There are many things I liked about it.  To start with, the story is good, keeps your interest, solid action and I like the length--it is a book not a fluffed up short story.  The editing is poor but not that distracting (I expect the editing will improve over time and I'm not a frustrated writer looking for a reason to bad mouth a book).  I will buy the next installment from this author.  The book has plenty of action and science.  My disappointment in the author comes from the less than artful sex scene and needless (juvenile) references to female features.  It was unnecessary and detracted from an otherwise good story.",119,4

Bad points: Bad editing was irritating at times with grammatical and spelling errors. Some sentences were confusing and run-on and had to re-read several times to parse correctly. Next time, add more commas, paragraphs, and chapters. Final statement: I relay appreciate the time and effort put into creating this book, and I admire and commend the writer for this work.

The misspelled words, the run-on sentences, the sentence fragments, the poor grammar, and the bad punctuation all are errors that an editor could have corrected.  The other very big problem with this book that an editor could have corrected is that it is much too long.  Just because an author has a thought does not mean that it needs to be written into the book.  The book could easily have been reduced by 25% without compromising the story line at all.
Additionally, the book seemed to have been written by a very juvenile thirteen-year old, who was trying to depict how he would feel once he reached the old age of eighteen or nineteen.  Clearly, the attitudes displayed by the main character were not written by someone who is mature himself.
These problems overshadowed what could have been an interesting plot.  The author's ideas about the importance and use of gravity fields and controls were very original.",178,24

How are you supposed to sympathize with a character who is portrayed as so completely idiotic in his relationships with his family and associates?  The author makes it clear to us that the protagonist is supposed to be highly intelligent, and then he does completely idiotic things.

All in al this was a great space opera.  The charactors are well developed and likable.  The story flows and there is never ending action.  I was captured by it all.

That being said I have to tell you that this is the WORST EDITED book I have ever read.  The spelling and use of words is beyond terrible.  It almost seams as though the author used a computer voice dictation program to do his writing and allowed it to select the wrong version of the words and spelling.  I am the worst speller in the world, but he has put me to shame.  I found myself shaking my head in disgust as I got on into the story.  Come on!  There is no excuse for this (well perhaps a good story can take some of it away, and this is a GREAT story!).

I highly recommend the book based upon the story itself but beware, the grammar and spelling will eventually upset you.

I've seen this a lot in recent sci-fi works, and it's something that could be addressed easily with a proof reader. You know what? Lets just leave it at that. Desperately needs proofing, that would fix grammar and improper word usage.

 Lets look at the military aspect though. To be clear, I did not serve, but my dad was a CPO in the Navy. I can't imagine a navy where it is acceptable for a midshipman to swear at a Captain, or for a Lieutenant to cuss out an Admiral in front of other senior staff. The author would be well served to have someone, possibly the proof reader, of military experience to help him through those issues.

 Aside from those two issues though, it's a fantastic story idea, novel and well thought out for the most part. Some of the science is a little dodgy but it's science fiction...you can deal with that part.

Kindle_Store,B00C5HYEY4,1.0,negative,"I should have read the other reviews before purchasing. Something I seldom do is give up on a book halfway through, but this time I did. What bothered me most were the constant grammatical errors. The author needs to learn that using a spellchecker does not take the place of a fairly well read human being checking for errors (a proofreader.) The further I got into the book the more frequently I ran into such errors and it really disrupts from the story flow.

The other problem I had with the book was what appeared to me to be a 12 year old's level of titty fetish. It's OK to give a character large breasts as part of a story line. But the constant juvenile references to it and the resultant plot twists because of it are not just juvenile, they are not believable and along with the other problems were what finally made me stop reading.

Finally, the main character was just not very likable. I understand the concept of starting someone out less than perfect and letting them change and improve. And had I finished the story, I might have found this happening here. He was showing some character improvements as far as I got. But, I still just could not connect with him, or indeed with any of the other characters.

It's too bad really, because the author otherwise tells a fairly good story and there was definite potential. This is perhaps the best example I have seen of someone that is not ready to self-publish.

Kindle_Store,B00C5HYEY4,2.0,negative,"I have read all of the reviews and they pretty much describe why this book gets a low rating. To summarize:
- Spurious capitalization and bolding of words,
- Extensive missed spelled words or application of wrong words
- Limited use of punctuation and when it is used it appears to be applied incorrectly in many instances
- An infatuation with large breasts is evident in almost every chapter in the book
- The writing could be much tighter and a lot less wordy

I actually started highlighting these issues when I spotted them and it became a game, but even that stopped being fun as I read the story because they became so common. I made it to chapter 22 (about 54% of the book according to my Fire) before I stopped reading the book for now.

The funny thing is, if you look closely at the description of the book on Amazon, all of these issues are evident in the book description text. Well, except for the whole big breast thing. Hmmmm, maybe that should be worked in to the description for consistency reasons.

All kidding aside, I am assuming this might be the author's first attempt to release a book to the public. Hopefully, the author gets some lessons learned here about the readers' expectations when they purchase an ebook or even just read an ebook.  The story has potential in its plot and characters with some development needed in both those and other areas. Unfortunately, right now, the best story is masked by the drudgery of reading through the errors and overly verbose writing style.

A semi-literate 4th  grader could have done a better job editing this.  I 'borrowed' this from the prime lending library and I am very glad I did not spend a dime on it.  I would pay for a sequel if it promised better editing.",223,106

Dear gods man, have a friend, read this, or hire an editor, something, PLEASE!
- 'Coarse' is not the same as Course, 'after words' is not afterwards, 'finely' is not finally, 'Rooky' and 'Rookie' used in the same sentence and what the heck is with CO'2 for CO2. And these are all in the first pages of the epic.
- Finial e's are often dropped, making Here into Her, Mode into Mod, etc...

Maybe I just became numb or the later writing improved, but these errors became less intrusive later in the book. I did almost give up after the first paragraph, it was that bad.

If you like stories where the main character goes from ignoble obscurity to fame and fortune, then this book is for you. The big issue I have with this book is that it is edited poorly--if at all. There were many, many times were the wrong word was used. Descent instead of decent, for example. Many words were either missing an ing or ed at the end, or they were added on when the sentence tense did not call for it. I was pulled from the story so many times because I had to interpret what the author was trying to say.

It has some action to it but without scares. Mind you, this is the ""revised"" edition from September.

Also, the story takes place in the Ukraine and I'm pretty sure the country's moniker is ""the Ukraine""; but in this story the author constantly refers to it as ""Ukraine"". And the language Ukrainian people speak is Russian, not Ukrainian as the author laughably states. There's very little in the way of description or names of towns so it doesn't feel authentic.",148,16

Kindle_Store,B00D6XE2GQ,3.0,neutral,"Faith had everything.  Shes married to her soul mate the man of her dreams, Mac Byrne.  They had a wonderful son in his teens, and a baby on the way.  They didn't have much but they had each other.

She didn't want to tell him about the accident that they had that day for fear that Mac would be harder on their son than he needed to me.  Their son seemed to be more sensitive like his mother.  Of course he had to blurt out about the crazy girl, so she had to explain things.

She did everything right at the accident.  Pulling over to check on the girl they hit.  Exchanging insurance, and other information with the intention of calming the teenage girl.  That is until her father came knocking on their door in a wild rage.  Mac, a very big man, tried to take him on but the man was crazed.  She pulled her son into his room, coax him out the window to get help, and then when everything quieted she open the door.  Only to find Mac had expired in the stairwell.  How would they continue living without him?

This starts as a very calm and regular book, but becomes odd and dark quickly.  You will have to read this to understand the emotional side of it.",221,45

The writing details are also a bit askew on several obvious facts which bother some people a great deal.  If you can get past those two things and keep reading you will find a horror story not a romantic mystery.  The mother in this work is supposedly one of those women who loves her husband and her son beyond anything else.  The fact that she is carrying her second child evokes the reader's understanding.  But, the 15-year-old son is really a study in opposites.  When you think he will be strong he is weak and when he is weak he should be strong.  The husband who is a strong--very strong--and likable man is removed so early that the reader has to blink the eyes to remember him.  The character of the psycho, Emily, and her father are not clearly drown and just as one gets into the plot and begins to understand a part of it, the novel ends.  Very short, but limiting.",191,47

A simple fender bender by a novice teenage driver lands this family into a trap of a serial killer. It's a one day event and even though the story keeps your attention with the various views from the three main characters; I am left wondering if this ""oddity"" of Emily is paranormal.

It has very underdeveloped characters, stereotypical even, with annoyingly perfect omniscient insight. The antagonists have no back story or dimension as a part of this socially oversimplified novella. The protagonists are too perfect.
The author also talks about abuse without capturing the devastation or repercussions of it. I honestly doubt she even could fathom how ugly abuse is.
