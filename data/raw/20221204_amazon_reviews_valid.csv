All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,Great fun product.  Looking forward to the next dress up party. Going as the tattooed lady.,16,0
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,What a waste of money..this product is waaaaayy over priced for it's poor quality! I bought this kit to have my best friend (pro artist) draw an idea I had for a tatt on my arm. We followed the directions to a T and it still came off within the next day..the fine point quit working on all markers shortly after use. One marker never worked bc it was dried up. And the adhesive is a joke..it's messy and after a few days it makes your skin look gross. You'd honestly have better luck with plain jane permanent markers..and if you want a temp tattoo of your choice..invest in a real Henna Tattoo Kit..,114,1
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,I wouldn't recommend this product.  It's just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes.,13,2
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"pens work beautifull, but  after 3 days sometime less you need to remove.  Definatly not lasts lasting for weeks.  the latex covering feels gross and doesnt last long.  I will not purchase again.  Company did send out quickly.",38,3
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"I was disappointed with these. They're basically sharpies. They function the exact same way and the colors aren't true to the lids. It's fine to have them if you're expecting markers but they don't make convincing, or lasting, tattoos.",39,4
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"product does not stay on for more than a day,  Ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo. nice colors though!",22,5
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"Love love them where have these been,!  I love to change up my tattoo.  Never permant. Thank you love it",20,6
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"They don't stay at all, it says 2-3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and I was sadly disappointed.",20,7
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"This was really fun and I'm glad I got it because I enjoy drawing on myself and others but sharpies have never lasted long enough. They all work pretty good but the detail-tipped ones don't work so good after a bit of use and the tattoos don't usually make it to two weeks despite lasting long. Either way, I still really like it and recommend it.",66,8
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"Needs many, many sheets of transparent tattoo paper to work properly. They're not included in the kit and not mentioned except for in the instruction sheet. do not buy from here maybe buy from the seller instead. These are just permanent markers with glue/adhesive. don't waste your money on this item.",51,9
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"The product is not as advertised.  Mine didn't come in a box, the cleaner and tattoo remover wipes were not in foil.  The tattoo remover is very dry, without the liquid mentioned in the how-to video on the Bewild website and took three wipes to remove a test patch of the topper.  The topper dries sticky and gets full of lint and who knows what.  the pens are OK with good colors.  Too bad the kit is so poorly put together.  Bewild get your act together!",86,10
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,The ink washed off without the sticky stuff. If you use the sticky stuff then the sticky stuff sucks off the fabric of your shirt and the whole thing ends up looking like you have black balls of dust stuck all over your skin and you look dirty and are sticky all week. Its like having the remains of a large bandid stuck on you but with a drawing underneath it. Also the yellows and light green pens don't even show up on skin.,84,11
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"Not what I though, there just like color makers, not worth the money",13,12
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,My daughter has enjoyed this set very much and has given lots of friends temporary tattoos,16,13
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"We had bought several different types of tattoo pens from area craft stores. Most of them had at least half the pens dry and useless and nonreturnable due to store policies. We bought these on amazon based on a friends recommendation and were pleasantly surprised.  Colors bright and vibrant. All the pens were in new condition, not dried out like the store pens had been. My only disappointment was that there really isn't a lot of ink in these, they dry up much faster than regular markers. For the price you would think they would last longer. I'll be buying more. Wish there were more colors or choices of colors.",110,14
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,One pen was dried out when I got it and the rest of the pens dried out after coloring only three tattos and they were not large ones. Very disappointed.,30,15
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"This was a gift,  came in a cheap plain box.  A lot of the pens do not seem to work.  The fine tips don't seem to work.",27,16
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Great alternative for kids who love to drawn themselves.  Ink lasts for a few days,15,17
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"The product is ok. You're better off getting the 18 piece version, or none at all, because I got multiple red, green and yellow markers. The yellows hardly show. The ""tattoo remover"" wipes are literally moist towelettes you get at restaurants. The most impressive part of the pack is the sealant, which is essentially watered-down glue. You're better off with Sharpies or other thin permanent marker (That doesn't run through the creases of your skin, mind you), Elmer's glue, water, and rubbing alcohol. Things you probably already have.

If you DO decided to buy this kit, I suggest a thin layer of baby powder slightly after applying the glue. This SOMETIMES keeps the sealant from collecting lint.",117,18
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,This product is really good pens work really well and it is very fun to use. Although the top coat is quite sticky after it dries put really nice way to make it stay longer. It fun to design things.,40,19
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,The thick sides only worked on all my pens. Couldn't get any detail out of them,16,20
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,The fine point on the markers did not work.,9,21
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"These markers are awesome but they do come off way too easily, even with the protective coating. Having a lot of fun with them at parties though!",27,22
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"Ok my daughter does Cosplay, these pens were so great for her costume, they stayed permanent and no smudging. She had arms and neck tattoos for 5 days.  I do wish we could get more cleaning wipes but were able to do with it.",44,23
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,"So I got them in the time frame it, which was wonderful and all...BUT like several people have said they come dried out. I had never even used some of them the first few days i had them and they were dried up. ONE had mold on the fine tip! Im like what the heck?! Also they don't last more than 2 days if you even run a wash rag over it while bathing. Very disappointed.",76,24
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,The pen ink does not stay on like it says it should and when u put the adhesive on top to keep the tattoo longer it makes it look like it has a dark haze on it.... Tried to email the company because when we first opened the box of pens 3 of them were dried out.... So honestly I will stay with the sharpies!!!,65,25
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Love them! I think my daughter loves them even more! So fun to work with. I like being able to change--not really into permanent body art. These are perfect for that!!,31,26
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Some of the pens were dried out which I did not expect.  Did receive it in a timely manner.,19,27
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I really like them, awesome product. The shipping was very quick. I was surprised.",14,28
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Some colors don't look nice on the skin. One pen was open and thin side don't work.,17,29
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"This kit was a gift for my teen daughters.  They have a lot of fun with it.  The tattoos don't last long even when you put the protective material supplied, but they still enjoy it.  I would recommend it.",39,30
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,"I was so happy when they came in the mail. I opened them up, used them and thought all was well. the ink didn't run when I took a shower, but when I went to use them again they wouldn't work. If you happen to be looking for a one-time use, then you found it.",55,31
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,Did not work well... Did not last... The two black pens stop working before I could finish the first temp tattoo. Not worth the money. Just use eyeliner or a sharpie.,31,32
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,My daughter loved this gift. Awesome to have so many colors and the narrow and thick tips on each.,19,33
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,These pens were defective.  A very disappointing birthday gift.  Half of the pens were unusable!,15,34
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,This kit is great for any artsy child! This was definitely the favorite Christmas gift!,15,35
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,2.0,negative,I was really excited to get all of the different colors. However I found that it wasn't that great of a product because the tattoos do not stay on for longer than a day when it says it will stay on for at least 2 weeks. It's fun but I was disappointed,52,36
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,these temporary tattoo pen really work as just like regular mark pens work nothing different just more  ink less,19,37
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,Does not stay on longer than one day,8,38
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,Use these quite a bit and they stay on for a long enough (I don't use the covering either),19,39
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"look its a demo thing, if u wanna make sure this is the design u want and placement, i say get this...kool lil kit to play with, before getting a real tattoo..im solid on this! thanks",36,40
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,Worked really well. Need more black pens in the set though,11,41
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I didn't buy this and Im not recommending using temp tattoo markers. Use sharpies they have cleaner, clearer colors that show up well. You can get sharpie off easily with hand sanitizer or alcohol swabs and warm water it's simple so please don't waste your money when you can use sharpies.",51,42
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,I like to play with them. They are a bit to easy to come off. Fun to play with though.,20,43
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,5.0,positive,"I bought this for my 15 year old niece & as far as I can tell she was thrilled with it!
She wants a tattoo when she turns 18, so I thought this would help her make that decision.",39,44
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"They are good colors and even without the coating, the design will last a few days.  Only issue is that after you first do them, you need to let it dry a bit and even then, a bit can rub off.  Very fun.",43,45
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,1.0,negative,It was a total waste of good money being thrown in garbage.,12,46
All_Beauty,B00G6S8UY8,4.0,positive,"Looks real, had several people come up to me and comment- hard part was telling them it was a temp!! Glue is sticky even when dry - use transparent powder to keep lint from sticking to it and keeping it clean after every wash.",44,47
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,This thing is a waste of money doesn't even stay between your breast. Maybe if you are a very large and obese person it might work. I'm small with very large breast this thing was like huge between my breast and kept popping out tried with a bra and with a bra under a tank didn't work,57,0
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Didn't work for me but was able to get a refund promptly. I think this is for larger chest ladies!,20,1
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"And if you orders in the next 10 minutes, you'll get the Taco Turtle absolutely free!",16,2
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,I couldn't get it to stay between my 38D boobs- otherwise great idea!,13,3
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,I use this almost every night now. Tip: it stays in place better if you wear a sports bra. I would buy it again.,24,4
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"It cute. However my chest killed this lil bear. If you are above a B, don't waste your money.",19,5
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,Not a big help for my big boobs. I'm an H cup and was super hopeful this would help. It doesn't sit right or stay still. I'm like come on my boobs should hold it in but they don't. I missed the free return window bc I went out of town.,51,6
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"Sleep with this every single night, not to prevent wrinkles but for painful pregnancy boobs. OMG, so fricking painful!  Anyways, since becoming pregnant, I want to sleep on my side a lot and so I am worried about wrinkles too I guess... but the pain... dear lord, it's so bad. I tried using a pillow, but this just slides in place and stays better... I mean it doesn't even fall out when you get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom!!! Score!",87,7
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Dumbest purchase of my life don't let it be yours. Cheap toy that is worth 50cents at best! I was shocked to say the least. Roll up a towel & use that instead.,33,8
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Doesn't work.. since has no straps the bear won't stay in place so it's useless,15,9
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,I didn't like this....it didn't stay in place.,8,10
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"It's a bit thicker than expected, I imagine for more generous boobs. But! It's very comfy to jam into my PJ top. Helps with pregnancy sweats and heavy pregnant boobies.",30,11
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"The Titty Bear is adorable, curvy and shapely like me.
TB is not deplorable, as you can plainly see!
Made of firm foam, a cover that does not roam, My Titty Bear stays with me...even when I leave home!  :)",40,12
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"doesn't work very well ,  it is very small , better use as a baby or dog toy .  better to  just use a pillow",25,13
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"I bought this bear on another website.  The other reviewers are right... this would only work well for VERY large boobs.  I bought the isima breast pillow, and that has straps that secure it in place.  Sometimes I put a comfy bra on too (over the pillow) to secure it even more so, and also I like sleeping in comfort bras.  I would recommend the Isima breast pillow!  I have size C implants.",73,14
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"This works great if wearing a certain bra to hold it in place. My primary complaint is, it doesn't rest snugly against my body and in between my breasts. I'll wake up in the night and my breasts are smooshed together (the position that causes those dreaded chest wrinkles) and this bear is just sort of pushed out and sitting on top of them instead of being in between still. Need a TIGHT sports bra to hold it in place. At least for me. I'm 5'8"" tall, slim build, with breast augmentation. Might work better for natural breasts. Still use it though, I do see less deep lines on my chest when it stays in place.",116,15
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Bought this for my girlfriend who had been using a rolled up hand towel before finding this product. Works as advertised according to her. She finds it helpful to wear a sports bra to keep the bear in place.,39,16
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,I've been dealing with sweaty uncomfortable boobs forever and titty bear is the breast!!!!,14,17
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,Helps to have a shirt or tank top on while sleeping.,11,18
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"I am a 38 DDD.  Even with a sports bra it did not stay in place and as I moved it came completely out of place.
Too bad because it is super cute.",33,19
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"Might work for some, but was too thick for me (natural 34DDD). The bear design is adorable but I went with the Bosom Buddy which is a little smaller and it stays in better for me.",36,20
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,I have a large chest and this does not stay in place at all. Not worth the money!,18,21
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,Well damn I missed the return window by a few days.  I have DDs and this thing is too big! It has to be for someone with FFF's. Or someone with Nat Geo tits.,34,22
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"Outside of the novelty of the name and being a bear it's pretty useless, unless maybe you are very well endowed as with smaller breast sizes this doesn't stay put at all.",32,23
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,"Love It! After researching to find something to help eliminate chest wrinkles I saw this and thought, Ah Ha! It is a descreet addition to my bed and works well keeping my 34 DDD breast from smushing together. I notice a great improvement in the reduction in chest creases. Everyone tosses and turns during sleep so do be prepared to wear a comfy tank to help keep in place. H&M has great long stretchy tanks I use.",77,24
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,"I had high hopes for this product but in the end was disappointed.  It is made well and cute but does not provide the right shape support or stay in place (even with wearing a sports bra to sleep).  Ultimately, it does not do well what it is advertising to do.",51,25
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,Funny gift for a friend. Love the name.,8,26
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,1.0,negative,"its kinda to big and honestly its not hard enough to stay put and to hard to sleep with to might work for some people it just did not work  for me
I think it will end up the dogs toy.",41,27
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,Got lots of laughs as a gift for wife and friends.,11,28
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,4.0,positive,"I love this! I've had it over a year now, and I'm starting to think I need a new one; the foam inside has become a bit mushy. I like it too much and will definitely order another.",38,29
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,2.0,negative,Won't stay in place even when tucked into bra and shirt.,11,30
All_Beauty,B00P755UHQ,5.0,positive,My name is Bear ( a handsome Westie) and I approve of this product.,14,31
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,It is somewhat a pain to use in that it's sticky and slightly burns upon applying. The color is lovely though and just the 'peeling' aspect is really cool.,29,0
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,Lighter than I expected but I love it !,9,1
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,This stuff doesn't work like I had seen it in makeup reviews.,12,2
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"My lips are stained pink!
So are my teeth
... And my tongue
After brushing my teeth, the toothpaste foam is pink.
My finger tips are also pink.
I would definitely say it does its job.
WARNING DO NOT APPLY ON THE GO! You will stain everything.",47,3
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,I love the color super cute. Does make your lips dry though.,12,4
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,i really liked this product although it looked darker than i expected,12,5
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"interesting! this color is a much darker pink than expected, but it is a pretty pink toned stain.",18,6
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,"This is a fun product. Goes on very sticky.  You wait til it dries and then peel it off.  The longer you leave it on, the darker the shade.  I would say it looks like you've eaten a Popsicle.",39,7
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,Don't buy this! Horribly disappointed. I anxiously applied this and immediately knew I made a bad purchase. Lips stuck together after a length of time given to let them dry. When I separated my lips a stringy blob pulled off of my lips. It was gross. Then it made me wonder what in the world is in this product to make it stringy and blob off.,66,8
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,I got this for myself and it works perfect and it actually came earlier than expected ,16,9
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"Product exactly as expected after watching some YouTube videos of girls reviewing this product. Apply quickly before it starts to dry. Also, make sure like are dry and don't put chapstick on prior or the product doesn't stain as well. Impressed this didn't try out my lips like most lip products do.",52,10
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"I love these. They are really great, they last pretty long and stay even when you eat and drink. They don't leave any marks or anything once you've finished applying it and done it right. However, for me most of it fadeafter about 6 hrs or so though and leaves a thin outline on the edge of my lips but that might be because I often lick my lips. My favorite color is lovely peach if you just want something light but sexy red is also pretty nice if you want a dark red color. Just don't apply it to dry and flaky lips.",104,11
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"This was a pretty fun product and slightly harder to use than regular lip gloss. I had Fun experimenting and applying it, I just had to make sure to get it off my teeth wen I was done. However since I did get it close to my lip color I had to apply it twice to notice a difference and use some pretty thick coats to cover up my lip well. Its a good lip tint and my lips look great but still had to put on clear chapstick since it kinda dried up my lips. Would buy again :)",100,12
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,"This just didn't work for me on any level.  I've heard alot about this type of gloss and looked forward to giving it a try.  I followed the directions and put the gel on my lips.  It was difficult to apply evenly and was very thick and sticky.  After leaving it on for some time I tried to peel it off, but nothing really peeled, it just was stuck and I ended up having to wash it off with a washcloth.  What I was left with was no visible difference in color whats so ever. I was pretty disappointed and this ended up in the trash.",106,13
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,I would give no stars if possible.  Extremely messy and difficult to apply.  It is very sticky and getting an even application is next to impossible. I threw it away.,30,14
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,"Absolutely useless. The gel is sticky, clumpy and so thick it pops the applicator off every time you try to use it. There's no way to even spread it so it can dry to peel off. Extremely disappointed.",38,15
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,"Im kind of 50/50 for this lipstain. I like the fact the last long in ur lips and doesn't dry out my lips. Its a great idea. The only problem is very hard to apply, sticky and messy. It difinitely need some time to get used to it. This is good if ur not in hurry and had plenty of time since it take time to get the product to dry so u can peel them off. Overall I would buy it again.",83,16
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,5.0,positive,"Love it! It's weird to apply at first, and it's pretty goopy. But once you've gotten the hang of it, it's amazing! Dries out your lips (what lip stain doesn't) so have chap stick ready to apply after. The watermelon color is more red than I had expected. Lovely peach is a nice, light pink. Just bought another in the peach color!",62,17
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,Don't buy this cheap TERRIBLE LIP GLOSS. ITS THE WORSE !!  it's doesn't even apply to my lips. It's like plastic in a tube. Absolutely terrible,26,18
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,This stuff is so gooey it's hard to keep it on your lips for more than 30 seconds.  It feels gross and doesn't really peel off.,26,19
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,too dry on my lips. difficult to apply. and it barely shows.,12,20
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,1.0,negative,to hard to get on straight..needs a better applicator,9,21
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,2.0,negative,"This applies horribly, burns the lips, and is just gloppy. It doesn't ever dry to peel off, and is so gelatin like that it is next to impossible to spread over the lips.",33,22
All_Beauty,B011773GBE,4.0,positive,The peach is a little lighter than I expected more of a very light pink it's a little messy but once you get  the consistency right it peels off easy and lasts all day and it's easy to remove I just scrub my lips and it comes off when I don't want the color any more,56,23
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,it glides on easily  and is waterproof which is a very good thing but most are lighter than I thought they would be but yet happy with the lipstick,29,0
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Nice for the price!! Some of the colors are pretty much the same, so I'm giving a few away as a gift to a friend. Feels good on lips not too glossy and not too heavy. Some do have ""a shimmer"" which I don't prefer, but can deal with. They did come early in mail, but still took 3 1/2 wks to arrive. Overall, I'm happy with purchase.",68,1
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,I'm not really pleased with it.  My lipsticks were smashed and the entire caps were smeared with lipstick. All the colors look the same.  Also this product smells very weird!!,30,2
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,I received my order way sooner than I expected to. This was def worth the buy! I am a caramel African American and all of the colors showed up great on me. The texture of these lipsticks apply very smooth and the colors lasted longer throughout the day than I expected. Def will be ordering these in different colors. I absolutely adore my set!,64,3
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"I like how smooth they are. The lipstick does slide out if tilted down. For the price they are great, pretty colors, cute design and overall quality of the lipstick and how it feels and looks is good.",38,4
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,I got this order early than I expected.. they did good in packaging.. just a bit small size than I expected..,21,5

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,it is exactly what i payed for thanks!,8,7
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,Thanks. My product arrived in a timely fashion and everything was there,12,8
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,These could be better. The colors are great but don't last at all,13,9
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Beautiful lipstick shades, highly pigmented. There were a few issues with packaging but overall a great set",17,10
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,They are too chalky and makes your lips look super dry. The two stars are for some of the colors I liked.,22,11
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,"I love these lipsticks. I shared with my family, they all loved them. They stay on great",17,12

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Came a little late but this is a very good product.

Pros: Slides on easily, nice colors, long lasting, very good for the cost

Cons: Small tube, colors are similar, the sides of the tube had some smeared lipstick when I got it",43,15
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,All r different colors and really good.. Recommended !!!,9,16
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"Greatest cheapest lipstick bundle EVER!! All colors are true to picture. My favorite is the most orangeish color!! Some of the lighter colors look a little cheap and shimmery vs an actual color, my reasoning for the 4 stars. Otherwise for what I paid, I'm totally satisfied with my orange ",50,17
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,Because they are not big and they don't have color that much with u put it on,17,18

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,"Okay, so I was excited to receive these, and then I swatch them and they're all almost the same color. The orange and red are almost the same and ll the pinks are similar. I don't know which is which. Oh, and I received two 08's. They didn't come too clean. Like the caps had a bit of lipstick residue on them. They are really small. They're not drying though, they are creamy. I just hope none of them break when applying. However, I'm not too pleased.",87,21

All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,The colors are very pigmented and easy to apply but may have to apply more throughout the day because they are not long lasting other than that the lipstick containers are very cute and came quick,36,23
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,Waited for a long time but it was nice packages love the purple one.,14,24
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,2.0,negative,Horrible smell. and construction is very cheap.what you pay is what you get,13,25
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,4.0,positive,"I like the variety of colors although you do have to be careful because they do break easily. But the color stays on great, Worth the money.",27,26
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,5.0,positive,"My order still says that the earliest it will arrive is Feb 26th, but here it is on the 25th, which is nice. The lipsticks are creamy and soft on my lips and that makes me happy. They were all pretty colors, but I guess because I'm dark they don't transfer so well but whatever! I'm happy to have them either way. They aren't super pigmented when applied, but that might be because of my skin. The colors I wore were 10 (first pic) and 13 (second pic)

Edit: I've concluded last night that some are more pigmented than others (aka the light pinks)",104,27
All_Beauty,B017IJVDPG,1.0,negative,These lipsticks were very cheap. I used one once and it broke right off and the other have been very hard and don't apply very well. I wouldn't recommend this product at all.,33,28

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,I would not recommend this product for those looking for a 'color correction' pallet like I was. I found better products at Sephora.,23,0
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,I was not impressed with this. The makeup is impossible to use and the brush broke when I took it out of the package.,24,1
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I have not really tried working with it much yet but will get around to it.,16,2
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Smaller than I expected but still a good size.  Sponge is adorably cute. And brush is very soft.  Some colors aren't very pigmented but others are.,26,3
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Honestly. If you cant spread this you aint applying it correctly. This is the second time getting this pallet. The colors are great and go one well IF you put it on the RIGHT way. Ive had my first pallet since nov. - january. So it has a good life span. Also the brush is amazing. Still learning the blending sponge since not 2 days having it my ex friend stole it. But other then that im givinf this product 5 stars. If no one knows how to contour id suggest a few youtube videos on how to contour and such!,101,4
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,A lot smaller than I thought it would be  and it's very shiny on the skin I could have gotten better quality for the same price at Walmart so I'm pretty disappointed,32,5
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,My daughter loves this makeup kit.  Only complaint is it'snot very sterdy packaging and not very much makeup.,18,6
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This is very cheap makeup. This is the kind of quality you'd see from a dollar store or in a children's play makeup kit. I tried to use it and it caked up all over my face.,37,7
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,The brush is the nicest thing out of this set. The blender sponge is uber small and the colors are very hard to use. They don't apply easily and blending is difficult.,32,8
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,"The pallete is extremely pigmented which I liked. However, the brush and the sponge that was supposed to come with it never came! All in all I was kind of disappointed.",31,9
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,didn't blend at all and the sponge didn't even come with it just saying,14,10
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Doing what name brands are for a lot more reason cost! Thank you! This is allowing my budding make-up artist learn the tricks if the trade for a lot less!,30,11
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,i just thought it would be bigger and come with instructions... but the product is great and it was fast shipping,21,12
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I am so happy this was actually supposed to come on January 5-10 so it came early I love the brush and the sponge plus I rubbed my finger in the color and it came off very pigmented and I'm so excited to use so thank you so much!!!,49,13
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,The brush that comes with it is a little weird but I love it,14,14

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"It comes with a good brush and normal sponge, the box material is of cheap quality but overall the price matches with the products..",24,19
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This should be offered at a dollar store. Oily and very bad quality makeup. Dont waste your money.,18,20
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,To me this feels more like Halloween makeup than every day makeup. It's a constancy issue for me.,18,21
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,All of the inserts were melted and fell out with no brush,12,22
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"Though the brushes were good, the makeup was cheap, heavy, cakey, thick and terrible.",14,23
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"This kit is very small. Everything is way smaller that you may think, but the makeup itself is good quality. The beauty blender it comes with is tiny and useless, i threw it away, its almost like a novelty toy. The brush is great and so is the makeup, but its creme. That means you have to put a few drops of water on the color you're using and water on the brush before using. I really like the palette colors. I would recommend for the price.",87,24
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"I like the tacky-ness of the product. It really makes powdered colors stick, and look vibrant.

The brush and sponge did not come with the makeup I received. :(

Amazon refunded the money for this item back to me and said it was ok that I kept the product since I didn't receive all the pieces. This made the experience super positive for me! I ended up spending more money on Amazon because of their ability to turn a bad experience into a positive experience one!",86,25
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This is like childrens fake makeup. The brush has bristles just falling out of it, I could have got better quality makeup at the dollar store.",26,26

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"I love this product,  it was just as described!",9,28
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,AWFUL!!! DO NOT BUY!!! I can't even use it. I knew it was going to be not the best quality but honestly my 3 year old sister would have better play makeup than this,34,29
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"so much yes!!! i love this pallet. this is great for experienced artist or a true beginner. it has so many colors to choose from you cant go wrong, great for contouring!!!! the blender is a nice size and shape and the brush is great! i deffeintly reccomend this",49,30

All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"i didn't like it at all, unfortunately. It made my face break out. Would not buy again :/",18,33
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This product is okay, but tens to leave the face looking oily.",12,34
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I love this product. I have watched a bunch of videos on YouTube on how to contour and figured I would give it a try. I ordered this kit and couldn't wait to try it. After a few attempts I think I have got it down! I would totally recommend this to my friends and relatives. I have enclosed a photo of before and after :) This is a definite product if you want to try to contour.,78,35
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"Reallly nice brush and blender, the kit is good quality also just very limited quantity for each color.",18,36
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,The product is OK. I might try another product to compare.,11,37
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This product didn't meet my expectacions because the makeup was all over the place,14,38
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,2.0,negative,"Love the this , I just wish the Beauty blender was bigger and I didn't get the brush that it says it comes with ",24,39
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,"Works amazing, I love the colors and it was really simple and easy to use. My first time it turned out perfectly and I'm loving the contour. It could use a little more volume to it though. There isn't very much in there for 10$",45,40
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,I love it especially the correcting colors works great brush is great too and the sponge is small but works good,21,41
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,It's fun to use the different shades. The brush spreads it on nice and feels soft. I think it makes a great look,23,42
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,Well worth the money. For $10 you have a contour kit with a free brush and beauty blender. The colors are alittle light but they still work they are very creamy not thick. I highly recommend.,36,43
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"It was exactly what I expected, very good, high quality and worth the price",14,44
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,Product was alot smaller then I expected but good quality. I love the brush.,14,45
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I like it but only used a few colors and it runs out fast.,14,46
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,One of the better ones I have tried.  Matches skin and doesn't make me break out if I accidentally leave it on overnight.,23,47
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"I would never buy this product again or recommend to ANYONE. The creams are so terrible, they can barely be applied!! They are NOT spreadable. I might just throw this right out..a day after it came in the mail. SO DISAPPOINTING.",41,48
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,This sucked. Didn't work at all. I would never buy this again. I was extremely dissapointed,16,49
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,The beauty blender was smaller than expected but everything else was perfectly fine and came on time.,17,50
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,"This was a multi purpose pallet that I loved to use, I am planning on purchasing a new one as I just recently went through my last one after almost 2 years.",32,51
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,5.0,positive,i have ordered this over and over again love it,10,52
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I like this product just fine for the price. I have another set by another company and they are about the same. It's not supposed to be clown make up. I'm satisfied with it. There's something for all skin tones.,40,53
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,4.0,positive,I actually really like it...im a tomboy so i don't do makeup. When I got the pallet...i just went on youtube for how to's and I really like the look. Gave it 4 stars because it's a little thick...but good.,40,54
All_Beauty,B01BHM6K1C,1.0,negative,"This was terrible! It almost looks like a kids set for makeup, plastic ! I couldn't even use it really because the contour won't even come out of the circle with the brush! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!",38,55
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"I use this for a rainforest reptile habitat.  It works great and makes feeding easier.  I like that my reptiles go right up to it after I place it in the tank and I can watch them feed more easily.  If you buy this make sure you clean it the next day. I am sure this has nothing to do with the design of the product, but I have found that one or two crickets will die inside each feeding.",80,0
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"This another great Exo-Terra product, very well made and functional.  It's surprisingly heavy and thick and very durable.  Safe for my chameleon or any reptile, perfect for supplement coating and feeding crickets.",32,1
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,I really like the idea of this but I purchase 35 small crickets for my beardie and dumped them in and i couldn't close the bottom lid fast enough and oops like 15 got free...not cool. >:/,37,2
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,My bearded dragon only went to this twice.  I have better chance to just toss 5 to 10 crickets in for him to chase around.  Looks nice in the terrarium though.,31,3
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,Does not fit together snugly to keep crickets in.,9,4
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,My beardie loves it! It comes in his tank and he knows whats gonna go down!,16,5
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,"Total junk. The pieces barely fit together and the plug won't stay in....I have to tape it closed. My bearded dragon immediately tried to walk onto the rock in which all of the pieces came crumbling down and crickets were everywhere!
I would try to return it but I doubt theyll take it back after Ive used it ONCE.

You could DIY something much better!!!",65,6
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"Our BD loves this feeder!! I only give it 4 stars because it is pretty hard to get the crickets in the rock and keep them in there before closing the rock. Everytime I've tried, at least one or two crickets would escape.... until we bought another product called Lee's Kricket Keeper. The Kricket Keeper comes with 4 tubes that the crickets naturally want to hide in so when you pull a tube out, you can get a lot of crickets at once. We now just use the tube to fill the cricket feeder then quickly close the rock. Then we place the rock in the terranium, unplug the hole, and our BD will basically sit in front of the opening and grabs each cricket as soon as it approaches the opening.",132,7
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"I like the idea behind this feeder.  It feels substantial.  It looks good.  But it has significant flaws.  The stopper doesn't fit, and requires modification to make it useful.  Probably best to just get an appropriately sized rubber stopper at the hardware store.  But the biggest problem is that it does not have a means to lock it closed.  This may not matter too much with smaller lizards, but our full size adult bearded dragon figured out where the crickets were the first time it was used.  Why sit there wondering if there are more crickets when you're a dragon?  Just shove the rock until it splits and then you get all the crickets at once.  (Never mind that calcium and vitamin dust go everywhere in the process).  So while refrigerated crickets are easy to load into an opened cricket rock, warmed up crickets are even easier to get out (if you're a dragon) by kicking the rock open.

Add a reliable locking mechanism and a stopper the fits and I'll be a customer for life.  Otherwise, buy with caution.",180,8
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,"1) The little ""cork"" to ""lock"" in the crickets was way to loose. 2)The crickets felt it was their safe place and stayed in - instead of crawling out - to be eaten alive!",34,9
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,Very Bad quality. Does not work and is complete garbage. It is most certainly not worth the money.,18,10
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,Great way to coat the crickets with calcium and it looks good in my water dragons home.,17,11
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"It's very hard to cover crickets with calcium powder every morning ""somehow"" to be sure our baby bearded dragon gets his essential nutrients so we use this rock to do it. We sprinkle a small amount of calcium powder inside the rock.  Every morning we place 3-5 large/small crickets inside  (covering the peep whole every time we fish out crickets from their storage container).  After turning the rock carefully upside down and shaking the rock side to side in a gentle manner, they get fully coated with the calcium.  The crickets play inside for a short bit while getting coated with the calcium powder. The goastly looking crickets come out fully white playing peek-a-book for a short bit (while the dragon eyes the whole patiently waiting for its future meal to pop out.  It makes for a very happy ""and healthy"" dragon at play with his/her food.  Baby bearded dragon also likes to climb on the rock and rest a bit.  Good purchase, arrived on time and a very hard sturdy design.",172,12
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,Works good if you want a lazy dragon. Ours would sit and wait for each cricket and snatch them right out of the hole. We have a baby and he loves chasing them now that we quit using this.,39,13
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,Worked like a charm and made our hungry hungry geckos happy by giving them all the live hunting food they needed while we were gone. Now if I can just get the mister automated they will be set.,38,14
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"Got this because I was going out of town and didn't have any one to feed my bearded dragon,  I put crickets calcium food and a girl water in the rock and with the darkness the crickets stayed in and would of course come out for the bearded to eat bc when I got home there were no crickets dead or alive in the cage and my beardie was not hungry or malnourished.",73,15
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,The piece to close hole keeps falling out,8,16
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,If you are like me and not a fan of having crickets around your house. This is a bit complicated to get them into without them jumping out before you can cover them. But it does what I need it too. And I use a 2nd person to help me fill it and close it quickly,56,17
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"I purchased this item thinking that it would make it easier to feed my baby beardies but it definitely made it harder. Usually I purchase about 200 crickets and keep them alive by giving them the orange cubes, but for whatever reason they started dying quicker. The very first time I used this to powder the crickets, my beardies were so happy. It was like a buffet. The only issue is getting the crickets IN and not WASTING them. The crickets were jumping out as I was putting them in, the used this to climb on top of to jump out of the beardies cage, and when I opened it to change the powder out half of the crickets were dead inside though i had only put in a few at a time. I guess for someone more experienced with this item, it could work how it is intended but for me it made a huge mess of powder and dead crickets. I wouldn't recommend it at all.",168,18
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,Got this for my chameleon. It works great to coat the crickets in the calcium dust but the little plug falls out way too easy so we don't really use it we just block it with a finger when we shake to coat the crickets and it works out fine,50,19
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,Captain for hole broke a little piece.  But waited due to lost shipment for too long to return.  Works just fine.  Lizard enjoys hunting crickets that come out,28,20
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"Put 12 fresh pin head crickets in, added calcium and shook. Plug fits horribly and does not hold them in nor do i think it would hold the dragon out from getting in. In my opinion its made upside down as you have to keep the lid (which has the logo, trademark and writing facing upwards) on the top or any movement and you spill all the crickets out.

Anyways put all 12 in, let a few escape, he ate and then i put plug back in.  Went back 2 hours later and all crickets are stone dead inside. Do not leave the crickets in like others have said in their reviews. Waste of money and time to us.",119,21
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,My bearded dragon loves hunting the crickets out of this! It has gotten him way more active then he has been in the past and lets me cut back on the amount of supplament powder I use since I can save it in the rock.,45,22
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"This rock looks so natural in my frog's habitat.  I have a rock fountain and added moss, I don't use the cricket powder, I use cricket drink to belly load my crickets, but I can tap several into this rock and put it in the tank, pull the plug, and let the hunt begin.",54,23
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"I bought this on a whim, and I have to say, I am pretty pleased with this purchase. It gets the crickets perfectly dusted, and it helps control the flow of the crickets coming out. My dragon sucks at hunting, so this was ideal for him. If I dropped them in all at once he would lose interest and not eat them, but some days I wouldn't have time to individually feed him until he was done. Now he sits by this rock when he's hungry and makes sure he gets every single one! Also helps with me not wasting as much calcium/multivitamin dust as I was before.",108,24
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,The bottom part doesn't even fit properly. Vitamins and crickets easily escape and create a mess if you try to shake it. Not sure if mine was defective or if they are all this bad...,35,25
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,Plug was too loose and at the angle it would not stay in.,13,26
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"This thing is GENIUS!! I got it with very little expectations, and got so much more! It's made of great heavy material which is perfect for a heavy monitor that likes to ransack his cage, and the idea behind it is amazing. Really helps during feeding times!",47,27
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"First off, you will need a cricket funnel scoop, Rainbowmealworms has them for 7.50, linked below. Scoop them up in the scoop, add vitamin powder to the cricket feeder, dump crickets inside and then close. Shake to coat them. If you have finicky eaters this works like a charm. The Exo Terra Cricket Feeder stimulates the natural hunting/feeding instincts. As i sit here typing this i am watching my three female breeder bearded dragon sit patiently, picking off crickets one by one.

[...]",83,28
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"Would have given it 5 stars but the little plug doesn't fit anywhere close to snugly.  if you have this problem, the quick fix is a small rubber band wrapped around the plug, and then it snugs on pretty good.

So the good, nice way to feed your pet, usually the crickets come out one by one and give the pet some time to breath b/t crickets",67,29
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,It does take either 2 people or to refrigerate the crickets first so you don't have crickets jumping out everywhere. I read the reviews first so I haven't made that mistake. My beardie is really enjoying this and it made adding calcium powder easier.,44,30
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,This is a pretty cool product. My Bearded Dragon anxiously awaits the crickets and attacks as they come out of the rock.,22,31
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,"Awesome exo cricket feeder. It's durable , has a lid to the top and an exit spot with a cork like cover. Makes for a lazy lizard to get their crickets lol.",32,32
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,5.0,positive,MY LEOPARD GECKOS LOVE THIS... AND I LOVE THAT IT PROMOTES NATURAL HUNTING HABITS WITH MY ANIMALS.,17,33
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,Hard to use. The idea is good but it almost impossible to get the crickets in without them getting everywhere.,20,34
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,Terrible product... Good luck getting the lid on before the crickets are hopping all over your house.  It serves as a hidey hole for crickets to escape being eaten. This product is poorly designed,34,35
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,This is totally worthless. First the bottom does not hold on to the rest of the feeder. When you go to pick up the feeder you must hold on to the bottom or you will have all the crickets that are left going free. Second how do you get the crickets into the feeder? Every time I tried the crickets just climbed out. It took some time to get even a few to stay in long enough to close the lid bottom. The few I got into the feeder never came out. Unless you think this would make a good ornament for your tank do not buy it.,108,36
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,great item but you have to get use to putting crickets in at first,14,37
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,"It's very difficult to get live crickets into this rock.  I lose about 1/2 each time, which I consider a waste.  you cannot pour them into the rock without them jumping out all over the house.  The ones you do get into the rock come right out once you remove the plug.  Either mine is defective, which I doubt - or this is just not a good idea.",68,38
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,"Received quickly and brand new as described. Tried to use it to keep crickets for my frog for a couple days, and they all ran out within 5 minutes. It was a waste!",33,39
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,2.0,negative,This thing sucks I've tried so many ways to make it work but every time I try to use it crickets ALWAYS escape. My beardie just climbs on it. If I wanted a rock for him I would've gotten one from the backyard and tossed it in the oven!,49,40
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,"This item looks more natural than typical feeders, but not very practical and takes up valuable floor space. Crickets easily escape while filling more than just a few at a time. Some users have recommended putting crickets in the freezer for a few minutes to make them a little slower, but why should I have to go through extra steps just to use this ""easy-to-use"" feeding rock? Crickets also tend to use this as a hiding spot and not come out when they aren't running for their lives trying to escape before you get it closed. It makes a good decoration, but that's about it.",105,41
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,Don't even bother buying this unless you feel as if you have money to waste... absolute waste of money... not even worth the $1 worth of crickets i used this with...,31,42
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,1.0,negative,horrible to get crickets into doesnt fit tight and its just not worth the time and money would not recommend,20,43
Pet_Supplies,B0002AR4CU,4.0,positive,"This product is very creative. It is just alittle hard to get the crickets in and the lid closed before they are all over the house. My secret is to do it in the kitchen sink, so when a few do get away, they can be caught more quickly.",49,44
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,"They walk under it often. Sometimes it's just a path from point A to B but the use it for ""grooming"" too. They also use carpet floor part to stretch and scratch claws.
One of my two cats also likes to drag a blanket around the room and tries to go thru arch with it which usually results in it being dragged across room too or arch unsnapping. It's not too hard to snap back into place tho.",78,0
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,With cats it's hit or miss with a lot of items.  This one was a hit.  My cat loves to rub her face on the outside of the arch and she often claws at the mat.  I've had this for five years now and it still looks like new.  highly recommended.,51,1
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"My cats like this.  It is kind of cheapish but it gets the job done and it has lasted about 3 years now. It has held up through me tripping over it, stepping on it, etc.",36,2
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"I purchased this product a number of months ago - while putting it together one side broke.  I emailed the company and they asked for my address to send another (I expected to pay for it).  It never arrived, and I emailed them again - an excuse was made and asked for my address again.
They never mailed the item - never asked for prepayment, etc.",66,3
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"My girlfriend's cat isn't much for toys but she likes rubbing her face into pretty much anything, she likes this and scratches her paws on the rug, some people are not so sure about the shape of the base, but... it works.",42,4
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"I gave this to my Sister for her kitties. They didn't want anything to do with it at first, but then warmed up to it. They use it off and on. You know cats...very picky.",35,5
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,There's no way my large cat would walk under it without totally picking it up. Very disappointed in the size plus the clasps didn't work,25,6
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,cats did not use or like--wnd when they tried the top plastic piece fell off,15,7

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,My cat's have no interest in the groomer.,8,10
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,That 1 star is from my cats. Neither of the boy or the girl play with it or scratch themselves with it. They took 1 sniff and walked away and never went near it again. Sorry for the 1 star. It's from my cats review.,45,11
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,"My cat loves this scratching post thing. He has killed the yellow ball, which is a good thing (I'd rather his playful attention be on this thing than on my couch) and he loves laying in it and walking through the scratchy dome part.",44,12
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"Easy to assemble, this thing has lasted FOREVER. My cat uses it daily to 'purr' against, scratch at the carpet pad and just generally play around with / in. My only complaint is it took my cat about 5 minutes to pull the ball off the string, but that was an easy fix. If this arch groomer ever dies, i will most surely buy another for her.",67,13
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,Looks exactly like the picture. The only issue is that my cat won't use it at all.,17,14
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"We are a multiple cat household - all of them will use it, and some in different ways.  They also like stretching their claws on the base or on the edges of the base.  They seem to enjoy using it as a ""door"", or laying under the arch.  Simple idea with great results.",53,15
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,Not very sturdy especially if you have a big cat!,10,16
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,"All three of my cats use it daily.  They love to literally brush themselves on the outside and inside, and when they are not brushing they lay on the carpet underneath, it's just great!",34,17

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,Don't buy very cheaply made has no weight to counter the cat's whenever he tries to rub against it the ball is rubbish and cheap and  the whole thing falls apart not worth a penny.,35,22
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,Both of my cats enjoy laying on or next to this and rubbing their heads on the prongs.  Like a little massage.,22,23
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,Very flimsy. 3 cat house. None of them even gave it a 2nd look after destroying the hanging toy right away.,21,24

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"Good luck trying to get the two black pieces to 'arch' as depicted in the photograph.  One of them snapped in half while trying to shape it into an arch, not that the flimsy button pieces intended to secure it would've done much good.  Tossed it in the trash.",49,26

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"Looks like it would be fine. It seems sturdy enough, and was pretty easy to put together. I can't, in good conscience, give it 5 stars, because I have no idea how well the little fingers work for grooming. The cat won't actually go through it. I put catnip on the base and she will stick her head in to get it, being very careful not to touch the sides. (She's pretty, but not particularly bright.) I wrapped the hanging ball around the top, and wedged it out of the way, in case that was bugging her, but that wasn't it. Didn't cut it off because I'm sure future cat will enjoy it.",113,38
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,did not cost much but even at that it was cheaply made and both cats sniffed it when we set it up and have not been near it since...waste of money,31,39
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,I have seven cats and none of them care for this. I put it on my patio and the neighbor's cat likes it so I supposed one in eight cats like it lol. It's pretty ugly but I knew that when I bought it,44,40

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"Took a while for my cats to warm up to it, but once they did they love it. One of my girls likes to sleep under the arch, no idea why, but she loves it. I can't say it does much grooming wise, I sure didn't notice a decrease in shedding or loose hair but they do enjoy the sensation of rubbing on it.",64,46
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"Sorry to give it one star but to be honest, it simply didn't work as expected. I should have paid more attention to the very mixed reviews.",27,47

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,Cheap and unattractive.  Even the cats hated it.,8,52
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,The picture is quite deceiving with the older cat. This thing is tiny and my cats looked at it as though it was an alien from space. I gave it to a friend that has two younger kittens that are almost a year old. She mentioned they absolutely love this thing. They chase eachother all over the room and run inside the hoop. It does capture their fur (not sure if they deliberately rub against it). The unit is very easy to put together.,84,53
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,"I bought both the arch groomer & the as seen on tv purrfect arch at Christmas for my cats. Neither show intrested in the ""purrfect arch"" but love the arch groomer. I had to order a second one.",38,54

It is well built and is still over by the door, all alone and waiting for my cat.",74,56
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,super fast shipping and the product is exactly as described!,10,57
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"Four stars because I'm sure the manufacturing cost in less than $1.50 for this. The carpet is flimsy but functional, the plastic pieces feel cheap. However it goes together as designed and my cats were sitting on high alert as I unboxed it. That has never happened with any other toy. The yellow ball was destroyed in a few minutes, I took it off. I need to find something else to hang there, the cats really liked with with hanging stuff they can kill. As a groomer, they have not really used it.",93,58
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,This was a replacement for a worn out groomer. It is on the flimsy side and only works when the cat is standing on or inside the platform. I am keeping it for now but am sure I will need to buy a new one in less then 6 months. Not a good deal. :(,55,59
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,Our cat never uses it.  Cheaply made.  Was a waste to buy.  She'd rather chase after balls or crumpled paper.,20,60
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,I wasn't sure if my cat would use this product but I've seem him using it several times. He ignored it for the first few weeks but seems to love it now.,32,61
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"A real piece of junk! I threw mine away as it was too much trouble to deal with returning it.
It got one star cuz that was the lowest I could go.",32,62
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,My cats think this is stupid and want nothing to do with it.  They will not walk under it or even rub up against it.  The little furry ball that comes with it comes apart way too easily.  One of my cats had wads of it in his mouth within seconds.  I was afraid he was going to swallow it and have a big problem.  The catnip coating is very light and really doesn't affect the cats.  The carpet portion is like velcro and harbors tons of cat hair.  The hair embeds itself in the fibers and won't even vacuum out.  This was really just a waste of money.  I'm glad it was inexpensive.,114,63
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,2.0,negative,She barely sniffed it and has ignored it ever since (about 4 months).,13,64
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,5.0,positive,nice quality. seems to be quite sturdy.  the two kittens seem to really like it.,15,65

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,This is a good scratched which my cat uses on occaission but it's a little flimsy. My cat can knock it over easily and really needs to be lying inside as the cat picture in order to use it.,39,69
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"Cheaply made, it looks much more sturdy than it is. The base is just a piece of carpet. Sadly neither one of my cats will use it.",27,70

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"Not a good product, The ""bristles"" are tiny little nubs, the bottom is a tiny piece of cheaply backed carpet and the arch connects at the top and is under such pressure that it will come undone. It hit my poor cat and hurt him.",45,73

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"The thought of this is better than the reality. It's weak and flimsy and needs to be glued to the floor in order to stay put. Otherwise, the cats just knock it over and its another thing in the house to collect dust. Ended up in the garbage.",48,75

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,My cats showed no interest in them at except for the yellow balls which they promptly tore off and destroyed. The material the balls were made of was hazardous to their health as well. Other than that they totally ignored both items so I threw them away. At the time I was recovering from my first surgery for a broken hip and thus could not drive to the post office.,70,77
Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,1.0,negative,"This arch groomer is flimsy and lightweight. Moves around too much for the cats to even really brush themselves.

Pet_Supplies,B000GLPJJU,4.0,positive,"The yellow toy was destroyed in less than 30 seconds, but the cats still play with the string. It took both cats a while to start using this for its intended purpose, but they both like it. You need a little muscle to assemble it.",45,80

Disappointed in this purchase.,70,107

I buy a new set every year for each dog. When they come in the house they have to get their booties on and I haven't had any scratches on my wood floors since. They are good for the snow but I would recommend getting a couple of pair since they will lose them in the snow if it is really deep. You will always find them eventually but it is always handy to have extras on hand. They didn't like them initially but have gotten use to them.,121,3

I fasten them as tightly as I can (without cutting off circulation), but within a few minutes, at least one, usually two slip off.

I did not want to spend a ton of money on boots for them and the regular Muttluks can each cost as much a a pair of MY shoes. I decided to give these a go and could not be happier. Being short, they are easier to get on than the regular Muttluks (we do own 1 pair of those) and the dogs appreciate the least amount of fussing with their feet, so we're all happy.

We took in my mom's dog when she passed away and we don't have a fenced yard so we walk her. The dog is about 10 and when the temperature dropped below zero she would start to walk on three legs and sometimes sit or lay down in the street. Our local pet store only had rain boots, which I bought. Based on the sizing chart, I bought extra large for a German Shepard. They are too big but we used them while I found the muttluks online. Use their sizing chart. Our dog is small for a Shepard so I bought the small boots and they are the perfect size. Make sure to pull the straps tight or they could come off.

Well, no matter how ""tightly"" I secured these on my dogs feet, if they didn't come off, they rotated around and around and around and around (you get the picture).  so, totally not worth it.  The only good point of these booties is that the toe material is a lot more flexible and soft.  I had bought another brand before (they stay on great) but the toe is just extremely stiff with no ""bend"" - so very unnatural to walk in (as my dog as told me...) and not very comfortable in the toe area.  These were more comfortable in the toe area, but that was it.",124,27

In fact, within seconds they both had them off. Both bulldogs were able to pull the velcro strap with their mouths and release their paws very easily.

I then sewed the Velcro strap across more of the boot, thinking that would help it stay on properly. It didn't - they still spin around. He has now worn through the fabric side. I'll have to see what other modifications can be made to try and keep them right side up. I expected them to wear out but not within 3 uses of about 30 minutes each.

On the positive side, he is not bothered by them at all and they do stay on, even during/after swimming. If I were to order again, I would go a size smaller.

He would lose his balance and sometimes have a leg slide out from under him.  We investigated different methods, and decided on these booties.  They have worked very well, and our dog can now walk confidently on our floors.  You can tell the difference in his ability when he has them on, he knows he can walk anywhere in the house, as without them, he is very hesitate to walk, and goes from rug to rug like he's island hopping.

The second cd doesn't teach you anything. It's set up like a game show where they ask you questions that are entirely in russian then you have to guess the answer.  This is not for beginners.  If you want to learn russian I suggest getting books and tapes.,73,0

Overall, this program would be a good way to start.",75,3

The purpose is not to teach you how to read or write or even put together full sentences.  CD 2 is definitely great if you want to improve your listening but have nothing to listen to.  The CD is all in Russian and teaches you to get used to it.  The first Cd is fun because you can play their games or even make up your own using the games they give you.  Before spending 100s of dollars on grammar books and such, pay ... for this program.  If you cannot grasp this simple vocab - maybe Russian is not for you.",123,4
Software,B00005RIQ5,4.0,positive,"Before you can learn any language, you have to know the names of things.  That is the key.  This CD-set understands that and challenges you, in a game-show fashion, to play along with the game and gain points in order to progress, to advance to the next level.  After all, you can't learn to conjugate verbs or understand the ""gender value"" (mostly foreign to native English speakers) attributed to the nouns and their relative verb conjugations if you have never heard the nouns before.  It is a very complicated thing, Russian and Ukrainian.  If it came in a pill, everyone could take one!  Too many courses go way too fast by talking about the possessive of a certain female pronoun adjective (huh?)- but this one is just the right speed- slow and simple.  Sure, it could have utilized more sophisticated graphics but remember, when you're a ""kid"" in a language, you have to be treated like one.  And being a kid again is actually quite fun!",166,5

HOWEVER, the CD's format does allow you to learn numbers, time and dates fairly well and then tests you on them in an effective manor.  If you feel you are weak in numbers, time and dates, then it is worth the cost to learn them.  I found that I'm very fast at numbers as a result of this course.  By itself, the course doesn't do much, but for the specific area of numbers and time, I can't think of a better way to learn.
It is also a nice way to expose childern to a new language.  It is fairly easy to pick up the words in the games and childern seem to enjoy these types of games.",154,6

Though I agree that it is a five star product for teaching children with the colorful games and basic words.
And Three stars for tourists who want just to get around with basic words, but to learn the actually language I find that it is impossible to.
This is also a nice way just to review but it is limited by only it's basic words.

It's basically a game that you have NO way of winning or even doing well at unless you're relatively schooled in Russian.  The one thing that this product did come in handy with was helping me to at least hear spoken Russian from native speakers while I worked my way thorough Nicholas J. Brown's ""The New Penguin Russian Course,"" which you should redirect your search engine to right now if you're looking to this product to help you actually learn Russian language - it's the best of the best.

This program stacks up well against the Knowledge Adventure titles like Reader Rabbit.  Skills such as sequencing, color matching, memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments.  Plus, there are three difficulty levels, so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level, you can adjust accordingly.

You can create a very basic, awful, template using the new template editor.  It's not something you would want to use unless you are a child selling lemonade.  Hey Microsoft, why not use Microsoft Word for invoicing templates (duh?).  It's only your own product!  Oh, and if that's not bad enough, when you want to send an invoice by email, it doesn't use the invoice template you've created.  Instead it generates an uncustomizable email in plain text which looks like something from the early days of punch card computers.  Also, remember those customer accounts you created in Money?  Well the invoice doesn't pull in the customer information!  That's right, you have to use a different form to enter the customer billing information (again) for invoices.  Terrible product.

It's the details with this phone that I love:  the rounded buttons which allow even my huge hands to type with ease, the strong construction, the bright (and great in sunlight) TFT screen, the ability for it to use my calling cards and enter the numbers for me, the SMS and data counters, the ""post-it"" notes feature, the alarm, the games.
The big stuff - RF and sound are great.  Battery life I have found to be good (they clam something like 300 hours in the specs - but I would say more like 150 - still this is pretty good).  The camera is only decent - but I don't consider this a big deal - its for fun and it achieves that goal fine.  The menus are fast and access to numbers is easy.
The phone is small and stylish, is smaller than my old T720 - if you include the antenna which you must! (ouch!).
Obviously you can pay more and get better phones - but for the great price its selling for now (net $50 return with new 1yr contract), I don't think you can go wrong, especially if you want a candy-bar style.
best of luck!

The menu is easy once you get used to the keys, since I have had nokia's before, the menu/navigation is slightly different. I also got a bluetooth USB adapter, which makes transferring ringtones & pictures as easy as ever. I just transferred my entire phonebook through outlook in one easy click. The camera takes ok-ok pictures, nothing close to a one megapixel digicam. I've seen my friends samsung e715 and this screen is waaaay better. The colors are more vivid. The only drawback is no MP3/voice ringers if you're into that, but the polyphonic ringtones in my opinion are more than enough, you can transfer any midi file (instrumental) to your phone. You can even assign pictures to your contacts so that their face shows up when they call. Supercool phone, would buy it again anytime! Remember to charge it overnight the first time though!",168,1

The keypad and area above the screen (with ""Sony Ericsson"") are a lot closer to grey than black, and the sides are silver... it just doesn't look good together.  I wish they had made the T637 in frosty white like the mainstream T630...  I saw that phone in person and it's cute!!

The included Java chat client (AIM, ICQ, Cingular msging) does not seem to work through T-Mo, but that's probably to be expected.
Other nitpicks:
- no quick access user-settable/programmable keystrokes or menu
- SIM card entries are ""second-class"" and a pain to navigate to
- default ringtones are peculiar/bizarre (IMHO)
- too many keystrokes to delete T-Mo's inane ""you have voicemail"" SMS msgs

Performance of Java games is sluggish - that's my only complaint.  You may want to spend some time searching for Mophun games, as those are much more responsive and smooth.

A lot of the negative reviews here make reference to the 'online' button being too-easily-pushed.  That may be true, but let me tell you something.  This isn't a flip-phone.  This is a 'candy-bar' style phone.  Non-flip-phones usually have a mechanism that 'locks' the keypad when the phone isn't in use so that random buttons don't get pushed when they're in your pocket or purse or whatever.

First of all, the small size and crammed arrangement of the buttons made it hard to type a phone number in. The keys are slippery, and thus my fingers were always ""missing"".

Second, the ""online"" button on the side is way too easy to push, and my phone was always connecting to the internet when I was least expecting it, and running up charges.

Third, Cingular doesn't make it easy to see if you're roaming or not on this particular phone, which accounted for $3,000 in spurious roaming charges being accrued over a course of 3 months. This, combined with Cingular's really bad customer service (they kept shutting my phone off, and the regional director finally had to personally intervene in my case) made for one BAD experience. Translated: DON'T buy this phone if you live near the Canadian border, cuz this phone won't tell you if you're roaming or not.

2. No Speakerphone...this is a huge downside.

3. There is an online button 'conveniently' accessable which can be mistakenly pressed and you'll never know you went online and you were being charged.

4. Camera sucks. It is a VERY BASIC one,... you have to be standing within 2 feet of the subject to get a recognizable picture.

It has no protruding antenna to break off and require replacement.  When talking from Houston to Lubbock, I actually have to hold it away from my ear because of loudness.  It even has a camera in its small size.  Best of all, it is logical and user friendly with frequently-used operations requiring only 1 keystroke or 2 at the most.

Another stupid thing is that they send me a software CD which is totally crap. There is nothing in the package talking about the CD, but I just thought why wouldn't have a try.

In my old motorola phone, I just just insert a wait synbol and its done. I don't even need to consult user manual to figure that out. For this phone, I read through the user manual and still can't find how.

2. I make international phone calls often and there is a calling card feature in this phone that allows you to call a number using specified phone card with password. All these are nice with one fatal drawback. Once the phone connects with phone card number, it will wait only for 2 seconds before it dial the phone number you want to reach. 2 second it NOT enough for any of my phone cards to confirm the password!

Your phonebook has space for more than one phone number (home, work mobile) plus it has a space for email. You can set up special ring tones for different people in your phone book. You can also take a picture of that contact and the picture will pop up when that person calls. It is a cool idea to have a single push of a button to turn on the camera and allow you to email the picture to someone. After saving the picture, you can save it as wallpaper for your camera and you can send it as a MMS, or via bluetooth or via infrared (IR). The camera is not that good.

In addition, it does not have any cover for the camera. Between the camera and the faceplace cover, there is a big space that often vacuum all dust into the back inside of the phone. So you may need to open and clean it occasionally.

It does not have Bluetooth !!. Fine, you can use a Bluetooth adapter or a wired headset or the built in speaker. I don't like Bluetooth anyway, it can make people think you are crazy when they see you talk ... to yourself. In addition, it consumes battery a lot.

Overall, I love this phone. Many times in the mall or in work place, people saw me using this phone, they stopped and asked ""What brand it is ?"", ""It is so cute"". Indeed, it is smaller and cuter than the Sony Ericsson T610 which has similar design.

If you want light weight and functional but don't like flip phones, this is the one for you.",272,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0002VIV76,4.0,positive,"I like this phone for many reasons, but with any phone there are some drawbacks. First of all this phone is very small and stylish. This phone offers a lot of bang for your buck. It has Mp3 ringtones, a decent camera, and good internet browsing and MMS capabilites. However, the joystick is very cumbersome. It may seem like a good idea, but it begins to lose sensitivity after about a week. Also, like other reviewers noted, when trying to push it straight down to take a photo or select an item in the menu, you normally wind up pushing it the wrong way. T-Mobile service is very good. I have been with them for 3 years. Previously I owned a Samsung r225m (see my review on its product page) and with the Motorola phone, I have noticed areas that I now get reception where I previously didn't with the Samsung. Overall, the this is a great, inexpensive phone, with great service, small design, and powerful multimedia features make a great cell phone for all.

It has USB port, but no cable or Software is included so they basically want you to spend more money on that after the initial purchase.

Back cover is hard to open, watch for broken nails. I tried all methods, screw drivers, credit cards, but this back cover has some serious attitude problems. Camera quality is poor, but so is with all other phones in the market in this price range.

Charger works on 110V only, don't plug it into an outlet in Europe or Asia, or you'll fry it.

I had this problem with three different t610 phones (how many I had to try before they'd let me switch brands) and know other people who've had this problem too. The c650 gets much more reliable reception.

And to respond to other's comments: I find it's relatively easy to pop off the back if you put two nails of one hand in the two slots and one nail on the other hand where the silver inlay is on the top of the phone. I personally like that it's not easily removed - so your battery doesn't just pop off randomly (my old sprint phone would do this). Also, if you set one of the soft keys to ""recent"" you can easily access missed or received calls. You only have to hit the call button to see previously dialed calls. You don't need phonebook as a soft key since pushing the up/down button will get it for you.

Finally, use the menu-* key lock! I've had the phone go through menus in my pocket and order wallpapers/ringtones without me even knowing it!

In each of these cases, my Garmin MapSource s/w had these elements, and the level of detail and accuracy are better, too.

1) The unit would show me being off the road even though I was on an Interstate. In this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around.

2) It directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction.

3) It could not locate a POI that turned out to be a few hundred yards away

5) It doesn't provide a chime when it's time for a turn.  It will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead, but that might be the last time you hear an instruction.

6) In one case, it got me to my destination (at least close enough) but couldn't guide me back to my starting point.

I then called their customer service department and they honored their unconditional 30 day money back guarantee policy - no questions asked.  For the money, I would recommend the Garmin 18.  I received it today and it is outstanding.",208,36

I have had it tell me to turn left when it should say right, and vice versa. It has routed me off of major highways to put you right back on the same highway a few miles down the road for no reason. It thinks I am on the next street over when I am at my house. It is fun to play with, but I don't think I would leave home without a real map yet..",92,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B00094OT54,4.0,positive,"This was my first experience with GPS.  I recently bought and used it on a business trip from New Jersey to Virginia.  Based on that experience, I will always drive with GPS in unfamiliar territory.  This software has some great features, including voice.  It is easy to get started and use.  The routing is excellent and it will even re-evaluate your route automatically if you should get off course.

The down side is that the GPS unit that came with it is not accurate and slow to respond.  I first set it up in my driveway and the GPS indicated that my position was in the woods 200 yards away. While driving, the GPS did track well on major roads.  However, on small roads, off-ramps and residential areas it thought that I had left the road and was 4-wheeling in the field next to the road.  This tended to confuse the software.

Do not use the gas station feature in the software, unless you know what you are doing; otherwise, when the software thinks that you are low on gas it will direct you off at each exit that has a gas station.  Until you realize what is going on, you will be loosing a lot of time, confused by why the software keeps sending you on these detours.  I guess I will need to read the directions on how to use the gas feature properly.",236,38

(I am using an IBM laptop; perhaps a faster machine would avoid this problem.) Second, several times SA told us to turn the wrong way. One of those times it lead us into a circle and then directed us into a cul de sac! Sometimes you just need to stare at the maps the old-fashioned way. Third, the interface is clumsy.

I haven't used competing software. For $99 you can have a lot of fun with this product, but don't expect it to be polished or super-reliable. And definitely don't rely on the voice directions without a co-pilot.",155,42

Of course, I'm not using this phone to listen to MP3s (already have a player), just to store some wallpaper and MP3 ringtones.

I _did_ get this phone to have a cool, functional new phone, and so far I'm very satisfied.  The sound and speakerphone are great, the reception hasn't failed me yet, and the battery time is decent for such a vibrant display (it's huge) and small form factor.  The only major dissatisfaction I've had is that the inner screen and keypad scratch easily (way more than other Motorola phones).  I've had the phone for less than a week, and even though I'm extremely careful, there are already blemishes all over the inside (the outside is flawless).

Pros
*Aesthetically pleasing minimalist design
*Top notch voice quality

*Adequate battery life (maybe two days worth of heavy use)
*Easy to read both displays
*Voice activated dialing works smoothly
*Easy to set up Bluetooth (Even non-Motorola)
*Mp3 ringers

Cons
*Really needs an external LED for missed call alerts etc
*Phone and Bluetooth headset must be kept on the same side of the body for best sound
*Vibrating alert is very faint
*The volume and voice-dial buttons are on the wrong end of the phone making them awkward to hit while talking
*The phone feels flimsy (I'll try not to drop it)
*The phone is a little on the wide side to dial comfortably with my thumb
*Same old Motorola interface (not bad, just not great)",219,4

The software from Motorola to allow it to talk to my XP OS, particularly the driver must be hidden well or I am more computer illiterate than I thought. Motorola's website is a maze of marketing and help screens. The voice command feature on the Razr is inconsistent. I am with T-Mobile that requires the phone to provide the voice command technology.

Reception is great, and compared side by side to my old Samsung x475(T-Mobile, same network as the RAZR), the RAZR always wins on the reception.

1. Good Reception

2. Sound volume is average, can be louder.

3. Thin but wider than most phones

6. Sent it back to Cingular under the warranty, they sent me another one (may be refurbished may be not hard to tell but it has the blue Motorola logo on it, so must be an older one)

Perhaps that is T-Mobile's intent, in an attempt to reduce calls, but as a customer in good standing, I would expect Customer Service to be more open and available to questions--especially when, in many instances, upon closer inspection, their billing statement was shown to be erroneous.

Put simply, T-Mobile's customer service is frustrating to work with--and when you are locking yourself into a contract for a year, that is not comforting at all.",156,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,"This is an address book? It gives you a separate listing, or line, for each phone number. No addresses or notes. So if your contact has four #s, you get four separate listings.

Phone numbers are listed by first name then last name. That's it, not filed by last name first. Hey, we're not all in high school where we look up our contacts by their first name.

No memory card. So if you have more phone #s than the phone's memory (I think it's 1000 or 2000 #s), just cull them out, because they won't fit on your phone.

Unless all your numbers are on the SIM card (rather than phone memory), which limits it now to 100 or 250 #s depending on the SIM card, no way you're gonna get speed dial to work.

The font used by the phone is a throwback to a decade or more ago. Not pretty to read.

But with bluetooth ear bud, most of the time, it can only have 1.5-hour talk time. But when you use BT ear bud, the phone automatically disable all the customized the ring tones, so that you have no way to know who's calling you from the ring tones. The only good thing of this model over my old V300 cell phone is the mini USB port which let me easily download/upload pictures and ring tones from my computer.

(c) An annoying buzzing sound once the connection is established

(d) Large number of dropped calls even in large metropolitan areas

(e) Menus are user unfriendly. The menus are not logical. For example, when you miss a call, you usually want to know WHO called and THEN check voicemail. On this phone, you're forced to check voicemail BEFORE seeing the name of the missed caller. Who wants to do that?

(f) No memory expansion available. I like to make voice records but I cannot tap into the large bank of photo memory. On my previous phone, the user had the choice of dedicating memory toward voice records or photos.

(g) The software that allows synchronization of contacts with one's PC is unreliable. Unfortunately, you can only sync contacts about 1/10 attempts, due to software issues.

(h) Phonebook does not support multiple numbers per person. So, if you have 5 numbers for George Bush, then you will have 5 entries for George Bush.

- can't see missed calls (phone just displays missed calls and picked up calls together so there is no way to distinguish)

- must copy # to phone memory in order to use speed dial.  Why should I have to do this?

They have THE BEST customer service I have EVER dealt with, and are very cheap (especially the family plans that now are only $8 for an additional line and only $10 a month for unlimited text messaging for EVERYONE on that account).

The second one had lines running down the screen the moment I turned it on, proving the ""refurbished"" phones are still very broken. Returned this on for warranty repair.  Got the third V3 and within 2 weeks the screen was going black when opening the phone.  Had to take battery out to reset and put screen back on, just to have it continually repeat.  Sent it in for warranty repair.  This time they (Cingular) send me a 'new' phone that was unusable from the first second I got it.  This V3 dropped calls like no manana.  In a 2 minute converstation you were calling back the caller 3-4 times.  Sent it in for warranty repair and got my 4th phone two weeks ago.

The Razr is a sharp looking phone, has great specs, fits nicely in my pocket or my purse, and has a very nice display (easy to read too).

I miss the status light from my other phones, which was a quick way to glance at the phone and see if I had missed a call or had new voicemail.  The vibrate function is a bit weak, probably due to the phone size.  The speaker function is loud and clear.  My main complaint is that there aren't enough slots for voice activated dialing (only 20, when the phone can hold 1,000 entries and that doesn't include your SIM card).  I think 50 should be the minimum for most of us who have lots of friends & family, and/or lots of business contacts that we're in frequent need to call while on the run and using hands-free sets.

Speaking of hands-free sets... I don't understand why the Motorola Bluetooth Headsets and phones don't always use the same power adapter.  I don't like having to carry cords for my laptop, PDA, phone, and headset!

Overall, it's a good phone and I would still recommend it.  I use this phone for both personal and business, so it's going to get a lot of use!  I highly recommend the Bluetooth headsets too.

As any girl would know, it's a bit challenging to put a phone in our back pockets comfortably, with the razr it's almost like it's not even there, at least until you sit on it! One thing I was skeptical about was the layout of the keypad. Most 'flat' keypads are difficult for girls to tap because of our nails, the razr equally sections off every key making it easier to grip.

That's it. You have to start deleting after that. I had to call Motorola and speak with an engineer to learn about this ""feature"".

Unfortunately, the replacement's screen would go dark every now and then for no apparent reason, requiring me to remove the battery and install to get it back. By then Amazon would no longer exchange the phone, I sent it back to Moto via UPS. I called Moto weekly to find out how long it would take to be repaired or replaced. For two weeks no one could find it in the system. Each time I called I was told it was being investigated with their highest priority. On the 20th day after the package had been received by Moto, the customer service rep finally told me the box was empty and they were again investigating.

Sure, voice quality and reception could always be improved with any cellphone, that's a given. But the RAZR exhibits no worse performance than any other cellphone I've owned/tried yet it excels over others in its design. It has such a small and thin footprint when closed, yet when flipped open it is comfortable to use, even for a long conversation. The fact that it supports a wireless Bluetooth headset is an added plus. You can put the phone in a pocket or purse and talk totally hands free with a Bluetooth headset! The RAZR also supports a wired headset and in fact comes with one free in the package.

The phone is great with two exceptions; the volume out of the built in speaker on the phone is too low when you are driving with your windows down or sunroof open and the phonebook accessibility is not great. I upgraded to this phone from an old Nokia that had decent volume and the phonebook was accessible by using the keypad to type the first few letters of someones name. Motorola does not allow that with this phonebook. You put in the first letter of the name and then scroll through the names until you get to the number. Not the most efficient method when you have over 200 names in your phonebook. I have been syncing the phone using OS X iSync (Address Book & iCal) over Bluetooth with no problems at all. It works great! All my names and numbers show up on the phone as well as my calendar which is a very nice upgrade over the Nokia which would not sync with OS X. I am going to get a Bluetooth headset and that should solve the volume issue.",210,120

I finally found something on the Motorola web site for $60 ($29.95 software $29.95 Cable) but one has to obtain a cable and the software independently which are not located in at the same place on their web site. The web documentation on the site does not give a full discription of what the software will do and there are no assurances that these functions are supported. It seems that a simple up-load down-load function should not cost $60. Especially in light of the fact that this function was included at no cost with their older two way pagers which cost substantially less.

To take full advantage of any product all that is required to make the product functional should be considered and I believe this is a key part of that functionality.

I am a person who likes using phones based on their phonishness, smallness and unassuming natures.  This phone is indeed phone-like and small, but few of its ringtones are of the kind that don't attract attention, which is indicative of its general overemphasis on useless bells and whistles.  Two of these are lousy-quality pictures and expensive games that you can play online for free.

Also, people give me way too much attention when I pull this phone out.  They are all, ""Hey, look at your phone.  It is just a stupid cell phone, but I will give you a lot of attention because you BOUGHT IT AT THE STORE.""  It's embarassing.

Most importantly, this phone is quite fickle when it roams.  I am in the midwest and roam with it every day of my life.  I find its roaming reception to be surprisingly unreliable.  I am also perpetually unable to reach the mythical T-zone.  I don't mind though, as I hear that the t-zone is a land of annoying ringtones.

You should save your money by getting one of those free phone with subscription deals.  I am a clumsy person who perpetually drops her phones into interesting places.  My free phones have always been game and responded by not breaking or blemishing.  My poor little razr is pretty scratched up, though, after only a month of use.

I've heard a humming noise when I use the phone, the phone book is a pain in the *** to deal with, and earlier today, it froze on me while i was using the web features. I got a good deal on the phone, so at least I didn't spend as much as others did.

I was directed to this phone and it has worked for me in so many ways. It's definite size was a give away. This phone could fit in any pocket you can possibly think of.

I'll list the pro's and con's on this phone.

Pro's

-Slim size

-Big LCD screen

-Able to change your phone preferences even while closed

-Able to take photos of yourself when closed

-Wallpaper picture can be seen when flipped closed

-MP3 Ringtones are clear and vibrant

-Bluetooth Wireless rocks!

Con's

-Buttons are smooth and it takes time to get accustomed too

-Could use better games

-Outside screen can get scratched and dinged if not careful

-You have to be careful about handling the phone because it's slim.

-Phone attracts fingerprints and smudges quickly.

Other than that, this phone is great. This phone will serve its purpose for the long run. If your looking for a phone that's sleek, productive, and reliability, make this your phone.",196,169

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,"I have had the phone for a month and like it. The reception is much better, the signal does not break anymore in the places it used to. The design is neat, both front panel and overall size. I use holster to carry it and does not take much space. I have an Ericsson bluetooth headset and the volume is so high that I keep both the phone and the headset at their minimum. The speaker is also very loud, I have to lower the volume after switching to it.

What it lacks in comparison with Ericsson is convenience of voice labels: each label is individual, so I have to invent different labels for cell phones of my friends (for Ericsson I had to say friend's name and 2 seconds later - one of three words: ""home"" or ""work"" or ""mobile""). I also miss the button ""C"" - Delete from Ericsson, I think Motorola's navigation is not that convenient. A tool to write melodies would not hurt as well, for now I have to write melodies on Ericsson-68i and pass them to RAZR through bluetooth.",185,172

The supplier happily provided me with a replacement, but I am completely unimpressed.  I bought it for its Internet capability, but it is unbelievably slow, and essentially useless for things like checking email.  The sound quality is very bad; I strain to hear my callers constantly.  The inside screen is impossible to see in anything but low light, gets gummed up easily, and the keypad is practically invisible unless you're shining a bright light on it (which makes it impossible to see the screen)!  It randomly turns itself off.  You can only store the last 10 calls received, instead of the 30+ my old lower-tech phone could.

I get all sorts of comments on it which is always a fun conversation starter and I love the bluetooth technology (although I have yet to figure out how to use it to the best of its capacity!)  For a high end phone though it does have a couple of problems.  First off, it is a little hard to hear people through this handset even when you have the volume adjusted to its highest (7).  I find this the most irritating.  I heard people alot better on my old crapy Nokia.  The second thing, also volume related, is the speakerphone.  It is not loud enough for you to actally put down the phone, so you are stuck holding the phone close to your face anyways just to hear the person and then close to your mouth when you speak so the other person can hear you.  Kind of a waste of ""speakerphone"" right?

Contrary to what some might think, it is very sturdy and durable. The menu is easy to navigate, and the smart buttons allow you to breeze through the menu. The sleek design makes it fit nicely in your pocket and helps avoid the typical ""cellphone bulge""! As for the cons, well (i) the large screen does drain the battery quickly, and (ii) fingerprints are visible on the phone in a heartbeat, you do need to clean it frequently! Overall, this is probably the best cellphone I have owned so far, and I would highly recommend it to those looking for a quality product that looks good!",124,175
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,3.0,neutral,"I bought this phone because of all the good reviews, despite my bad experiences with Motorola phones. Its a mixed bag. As is typical with Motorola's the battery life and the signal strength are significantly worse than my last Nokia. I had hoped that because of all the hype surrounding the Razr that they had fixed this problem, but no dice. The screen and buttons get sorta greasy and I am always having to wipe them off. And its not just cuz I'm a greasy person!
However, my biggest complaint is that the earpiece speaker is very soft, even at the highest setting and its hard for me to hear people when I am surrounded by background noise (walking down the street, or in a crowd). At least with my Nokia I could really crank that speaker volume up when I needed to.
Of course all this became apparent after my 2 week trial. At least I got a good price on the phone and don't feel like I got ripped off.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,"In short, this phone has been a total disappointment.  Watch out for Motorola phones--I bought it and immediately noticed a humming/frequency feedback which was earpiercing, coupled with a fading in and out of both the earphone speaker and the microphone (so that people I called perceived me to be in an area where I wasn't getting cell service).  At first, I thought this was a network issue.  Then, after 17 days of owning this phone, I realized something was up with the mic/speaker and called T-Mobile ""customer service.""  The best they could do for me, because I was technically outside the ""14 day return period"" was to send me a replacement phone (typically refurbished, though they apparently have no way of telling).  Replacement #1's key pad was peeling apart immediately, so I called and requested a second replacement.  Replacement #2 had the same issue as my first phone, only the feedback noise was worse!

As of today, the best customer service can do for me is to continue sending me replacement refurbished phones until I get one that works.  Personally, I'm convinced I'm never going to drop any amount of cash on a Motorola phone again.  And as for T-Mobile, well, problem solving and customer service is really not their specialty.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,1.0,negative,"Bought the phone more for its size than anything else. Was disappointed to hear a low ""hum"" when you open the handset.

He goes on to say, ""I have 10 other phones just like this back here...its just like that"". Nothing like that warm fuzzy feeling when you just bought a defective product and will be spending a boat load of time writing emails and making phonecalls, explaining why you were the unlucky recipient of a  defective product.

Before jumping the gun, I decided to call on other Razr users, those good friends of mine who convinced me that this is the crme de la crme phone. Well the problem is not just with T-Mobile Razr but with Cingular ones too. Issue is not everyone pays attention when they flip open the handset. The hum is sort of masked when a conversation is happening. But now I finally got enough people to realize that this phone is defective.

Oh well, someone has to do some basic quality assurance for Motorola as they have no problem putting a defective product in the market place. Not surprised the phone is free after rebates....coz its defective.

One last gripe, the phonebook is soooo outdated and a pain to fill up. If you ever had a Sanyo, Samsung or Nokia phone, you'll hate this phonebook.",253,180

I sent it back to Motorola since it was under warranty, but they refused to fix it since they say it had water damage (it is humid here in Florida but that should not affect a phone of this caliber) so my husband got the Razr Black and gave me his silver, which broke a month ago, this time it was the wiring in the flip part of the phone, this was covered and was fixed by Motorola, however I did not know this but when they fix it they relock it and now I cant use it on my system. I would wait until they work out the kinks in this phone, I have owned alot of Motorola phones and have never had this many problems.

When I say died... it wouldn't even turn on!!! FYI- keep all your #'s stored to the SIM as well as the phone. It's a pain to have duplicates, but worth it since you can't assign ring tones to #'s unless it's stored to the phone. Lesson learned!!!

Although the phone itself is nice to look at- even the blue tooth technology is another expense. You have to purchase that headphone separately... and I paid HOW much for this thing?!

Now after you listen to your voice mail you are still not done - you have to delete the text message that notified you of the voicemail.  I have been spoiled by being able to press one button to listen to my voicemail hence te motivation for my return.  As far as T-Mobile's quality as a Mobile carrier in the Austin TX area I would have to say that the call quality is much lower than Cingular and Sprint, I have found myself repeating converations over and over and drop more calls than I did in the early 90's.

This phone is very thin but it's also wider than you might expect.  It is hard to hold the phone comfortably because it's so wide.

My phone came with several wallpapers (some were animated) and very few ringtones.  It came with several alarm-type sounds but only 3 actual ring tones.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,"Jameson Thottam perspective on RAZR V3

I, Jameson Thottam looked at buying this phone solely because of it's form factor: it's thin, and it flips open. It's just the right size for me, and fits easily into jeans pocket - sometimes I, Jameson Thottam, can even forget it's there! Menus are somewhat quirky to navigate, but you get used to it.

Phonebook support is average at best, and won't sync properly with Outlook (loses additional data such as company name etc). When browsing thru phonebook you can only search by first letter, and it will display separate item for each phone assigned to a contact - proper implementation would display name only once, and then let you choose which phone no to dial.

Display is nice, but close to unreadable in bright sunlight - I, Jameson Thottam, wonder whatever happened to those nice LCD screens that were readable both in low- and sunlight?

Battery life is horrible, I, Jameson Thottam, managed to get 3 days max out of it when batteries were new, and now after coupla months it's 1-2 days. Also, you can't upload Java apps via BT, has to be done over USB cable, and I, Jameson Thottam, suspect attaching USB cable somehow wrecks batteries because the phone would start charging, and after that my battery life went drastically downhill.

SMS support is bearable, but you can't require SMS delivery receipts - this is just plain poor design!

GPRS & BT combo sometimes breaks down, and phone wouldn't respond to connection requests from laptop via BT - the only remedy is to switch it off and back on.

By no means a camera for artistic use, but the razr's primary function is a phone, right?

All around, I love it!  It has a great feel and I love to hold it.  The metal makes it really cool to the touch. Plus, it's the first phone I've ever had that fits in my front pants pocket.

pros

-this is the best looking phone currently on the market

-actually made $25.01 after rebate (price is $124.99 with a $150 rebate) cant believe people paid $500 or so last christmas

-awesome speakerphone

-volume seems fine on calls (read many complaints on here)

-no problem dialing with flat buttons

-some cool very loud ringtones already on phone

cons

-tmobile razr has video capture (cingulars doesnt) but its only 10 seconds tops and virtually useless

-pics from camera are below average at best

-internal and external screens become nearly invisible in any sunlight

-agree with everyone that phonebook is way outdated (its like buying a new $2000 laptop and then running it with windows 95)

The best thing about the phone is the bluetooth capability,the size, and the great sound capability.  However, there are several draw backs which include the short battery life.  I couldn't go the entire day without needing a charge.  I guess you pay the price for the size because it requires the battery to be small as well.  Also, the menu on the motorola is not user friendly.  If you don't use the voice command, you practically have to pull over to find the number to dial.  Also, you cannot utilize multiple numbers and distinctive rings for a contact unless you save it to the phone and not the SIM card.  Bad idea.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,2.0,negative,"I must admit to being a gadget-freak, so when I saw the RAZR, I just knew I had to pick one up right away. I was really impressed with its size, weight, and large, bright display. However, it was constantly confused about when it was being charged and when it wasn't.  The ""charging"" indicator would light up when I unplugged the phone from the wall, and would go out when I plugged it in. There were other interface quirks that started to get on my nerves after a few weeks of use. It also eventually wouldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour. I assume it was just my phone, and would spend the time to fix it if I otherwise really liked using it. Unfortunately, the user interface on the phone is annoying, particularly when compare with Sony Ericsson's - the RAZR is missing profiles (i.e. ""change all these settings at once when I'm in my car, home, etc.), has often used functionality buried under layers of menus, confusing icons and menu item text, etc. This all might be tolerable if the phone were free (with service), but the hefty price tag is definitely not worth it.",199,204

I have had notoriously poor reception where I live, and I felt like I might be taking a chance in buying this phone after reading several of the Amazon reviews, but, rest assured, the RAZR is very solid in this respect. Calls are clear where as prior high and low-end Motorolas were poor in the same spots. Fluid phone operation (if customized right), a very crisp and loud speakerphone, and I would say one of the better battery lifes I have seen in a cellular. The video and picture features are poor; these are meaningless to me as a user, but the bluetooth (to a computer, or external device) is fairly simple to use and works well. The keypad is larger than most, which I very much like, and simple to spot in the night/day as the phone illuminates extremely well in a bright blue. I wish that all of the buttons were raised, though, like the center ""5"", or that the keypad itself was not recessed.

I don't like that Motorola has removed the icons to place next to phone book numbers that indicate work or mobile or home(etc...), but that is one of very few complaints about the software layout of the phone. Overall, given what is available on the market I think this is an excellent high-end choice for any professional.",229,206

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000A6KMTI,4.0,positive,"Good phone, okay T-mobile service coverage and signal quality.

I am originally a Verizon customer, and used the Motorola C343 'el brickie'.  Verizon is way more expensive, but then CDMA has better signal quality and their network has better coverage.  After a few insanely expensive phone bills on Verizon I'm willing to put up with the rare dropped calls, and having to repeat a few words now and then on T-mobile.  So far customer service has been good, though there is a wait, and not all of it is available 24 hours, unlike Verizon.

Compared to the C343, the Razr is many times better! and acts the part of a premium phone.  It has much quicker recharge, fast GUI response time, actually has a real alarm clock, takes photos and *movies*.  The aluminum/metal alloy construction is very solid, and tolerances very tight.  As many have noted, Motorola's GUI interface is slightly less intuitive than Nokia or Samsung, though previous owners of Motorola phones won't have problems understanding the Razr GUI.

Keep in mind that Motorola is about to refresh their phones.  The USA CDMA Razr is about to be released, and should be very close to the already released Korean CDMA Razr.

Average bttry life, good reception, fairly quick processor and the Bluetooth works well in my Acura TL.  But oooh that LCD in bright light simply vanishes!  The keys are small and even with smallish hands I often hit more than one key. The speaker function is loud enough, but the clarity drops of as volume increases such that by the time you can hear it...you can't understand it!  A tactile bump on the send and end buttons would have been a nice touch.
  Obviously, skinny is cool and the silver is nicer looking than the black (unusual). None of my myriad of prior chargers work with the RAZR despite being manufactured by the same company! I strongly recommend that you purchase a genuine MOTOROLLA charger...esp for your car, since many of the knockoffs don't allow you to charge and call at the same time!
  I wish the text and numbers could be made larger (I'm into reading glasses now) and I really wish the icon for battery strength/charging was large enough to see...or at least have sufficient contrast to do so! AND, they should have damped the flip door so it doesn't SLAM shut. Vibration mode barely perceptible...that's BAD!  Lastly, the lighting on the keys at night is marginal at best.
  WHY CAN'T YOU BUY A SIMPLE CELL PHONE ANYMORE!! WHY THE RIDICULOUSLY AWFUL CAMERA and VIDEO FUNCTION?! For $150.00 you can get a great stand alone SMALL GOOD digicam by any of a half dozen brand names. Talk about crappy and worthless addons!

I decided on the RAZR primarily because it's a slick looking phone and as a person on the run I really appreciated the seemingly ingenious feature that this phone doubled as a makeshift electric razor.

Truth be told, as a phone it's more than adequate. It's thin, though a bit wide, and has a gorgeous color screen. Reception was a tad poor, but it's generally not a consideration for me with vanity phones such as this. I purchase them mainly to impress other people so I didn't worry for a second about dropping calls. In fact I quite like the distortion you get from a poor connection. My friends tell me I sound like one of those Cylons from Battlestar Galactica. I appreciate that.

Where the phone falls apart is its shaving features. At best the shave it provides is dull and uneven, so much so that you wonder how much consideration was given to this feature at all. I tried it on all the settings, GPRS, CDMA, 3G, PCS but nothing improved the overall results. And forget about using any sort of shaving cream with this particular model. I made that mistake and my Bluetooth hasn't worked since.

Design: A very solid form made from state of the art material, similar to Apple's G4 notebooks just when every mfg's heading for flimsy plastics.

For a thin phone w/o an external antenna and aside from service carriers, its reception is more than acceptable compared to phones with one.

Both phones are solid but if you can only have one go with Nokia 6230 its a better phone for actual phone calls and function.  The user interface is quicker on the nokia as well.

First things first..

Pros -- the phone is a great thing to show-off. It does look cool and attract attention.

Cons -- Coming from a non-motorola world, I definitely have cons with the user interface.

1. Mentioned time and again, the duplicate entries in the address book for different phone num's of same name is definitely an eye-sore (and finger-sore too once u start searching the phonebook).

2. The ""recently called""/""received call"" list does not display the time of the call right away(though its only a click away).. It just displays the list of caller id's/name's.

3. If I set an alarm, there is no icon/indicator on the home screen which tells me that an alarm is activated for xx:xx time

I can't agree more with the previous reviewer that as long as you get Sprint's replacement insurance (6 bucks a month isn't bad for a $600 dollar phone) you can basically do whatever you want wherever you want with this device.  My only complaints are that the interface is a little complicated (but that is Microsoft's doing), especially dialing on the phone, and the battery life is crappy because the device has so much functionality.  I just ordered an extended life battery and am gradually getting used to the interface, and I must say I am overall extraordinarily happy with my purchase.

1) It's difficult to dial on the road, I wouldn't even try (cool, reinforces phone safety!)

2) The digital camera is good for everyday use, but dedicated digital cameras do far better, don't take this thing along on your vacation and expect it to take good pics in and of itself.

Try dialing a number or anything using the touch screen and you have to wait a few second.

There is no way to get rid of program icons once you uninstall them.

It is impossible to call someone or text anyone while driving. (I know you not suppose to do it)

The good thing is you can access the internet. But wait, can't you do that already with regular phones?!!

Windows Mobile 5

Voice Activated Dialing

The voice recognition program is great.  After setting up your voice tags, to voice dial a number or start an application, you just press the record button on the side of the phone, say your tag, and boom, the number is dialed or the application starts.

The computer maintains its state when in OFF state and powers back on instantaneously.

The communications panel is easy to access and lets you toggle the phone service on or off, as needed.  I toggle it off at night, before I go to bed.

* 2 megapixel camera with decent video and flash
* micro SD card

* good looking
* stereo bluetooth (but $100 for a stereo bluetooth headset)
* uses miniUSB for recharging
* sound quality is adequate

Cons:
* music player has poor UI
* reception is not stellar, but ok for city usage.

I principally bought this because it was on t-mobile, I liked the design and it had a 2 megapixel camera with a LED illuminator (flash). I also do a reasonable amount of texting and picture messaging, so I wanted something good for that. I am happy with this decision.

The camera is quite good, for a pinhole camera phone. However, the maximum size I can send in MMS messages is 640x480. That is likely a t-mobile limitation.

The music player leaves much to be desired. There is enough of it there to call it a music player, but if you've ever used an iPod, you won't love it. There is no way to ""keylock"" the phone while using it so you end up ending the music play if you drop it in a pocket and bump it. The music player has no concept of what podcasts have been played nor does it remember the last place in the podcast like an iPod does. It is borderline unusable as an mp3 player due to this lousy software.

I had a problem with the phone after about 5 weeks where the predictive text stopped working.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,2.0,negative,"As far as features go, this is a nice phone with a 2 MP camera, music player, removable micro SD card and ready access from a PC. However, it fails to deliver when it performs its primary function: as a phone. Its voice quality is much below average and the speaker phone sounds like someone just cranked up the earpiece a wee bit. Being on the Tmobile network makes matters worse in my area where I have marked specific areas in my house to run to to make/receive calls.",89,9

Since purchasing the phone two months ago the screen has cracked in 3 places and now has many dead pixels in the screen.

It does have a great camera though.",76,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,3.0,neutral,"I too bought this phone 6 months ago b/c it's cute and has a lot of great features. It usually works well. So, I have few complaints about function.  However, soon after I bought the phone, the control pad and center selection key fell off of the phone.

T-mobile did replace the phone quickly and without argument. (I love T-mobile customer service!  Every time I call them they are friendly and solve my problem quickly)

But, about a week later, my sister's phone did the same thing and also needed to be replaced.  Now, these keys are again coming off of my replaced model (and a few store models I have seen).  Motorola suspects that they're using a glue that sucks (obviously).

Also, my battery only lasts for one day now.  And my charger no longer works.  I have to use the USB cord to charge the phone from my computer. A friend told me that Motorola got a bad shipment of chargers/batteries as well.

So, all in all, I do like the phone and it's features... Maybe I just got my phone at an unfortunate time and got stuck with sucky batteries/chargers/glue.",193,11

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,2.0,negative,The screen scratches too easy. Day one I accidently put it in my pocket with my keys and I was all scratched up. And the screen gets way to greasy like another reviewer was saying. Maybe he doesn't shower often either. Ha Ha.,43,13

The device is amazing and quite a bundle of features overall. Voice recognition works perfectly and promptly for me.

However, I have to give it low marks for cosmetics. The screen gets greasy from your face. It doesn't feel or handle at all like a phone. I think the only way you can enjoy using it is with a bluetooth headset. I don't like the slider aspect of it at all. I'd prefer a flip phone by a long shot. But this seems to be the best tmo subsidized offering at this date. Battery really does seem to last all week for me. Camera takes great indoor pictures/films and I have to wonder if the complainers about the camera bothered to take the film off of the lense.

I haven't figured out how to make it beep when a message is waiting and I really need that feature.

Get an arm band holster, screen cover, 2gig memory, and bluetooth headset; your going to want them for this type of phone. Not too bad.",207,14

10% of unhappiness is due to the fact that it looses signal in places where some of my friends' phones don't. Also, dust gets between a screen and a protective glass.",69,15

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B000RO2IEU,5.0,positive,"I have had my RIZR from T-Mobile for a few weeks now after switching from Verizon.  I was originally considering the Nokia 5300.  But when I compared the 2 phones side by side, the RIZR seemed more solid, more durable and less flimsy than the Nokia 5300.  So I chose the RIZR and I could not be happier.  The phone is  easy to program and a breeze to use.  The display is bright, clear and very easy to read (even without my bifocals!).  So far the sound quality and reception have been outstanding.  The best feature for me is the mp3 player.  With my new RIZR I can transfer mp3 songs directly from my computer to my phone with a simple drag and drop (the 128 MB card is not very large, but enough for my needs).  I can then select the songs to act as ringtones.  Being able to assign a song/ringtone to a certain phone number is a really cool feature, at least for me.
The mp3 player included with the phone is very easy to use too.
My only ""minor"" gripe is the screen goes black during calls.  But I found  pressing the volume up button, which displays the volume screen temporarily,  brings the main screen back fast enough for me.
All in all a great phone and highly recommended.",223,18

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,"This is a cool, sleek case for the iPhone 3G. It fits like a glove and does not add any bulk to the overall size of the iPhone, so it still fits in your pocket or other small compartments. The cutouts keep your control buttons and camera lens usable. The case is very comfortable to hold and definitely keeps the iPhone from slipping out of your hand so easily. That in itself makes it worth the money. It looks great, and the iFrogz logo is barely visible, so it doesn't look tacky. One thing I really like is that you can slip the case over the touchscreen to protect it if you know it's going to be in harm's way -- e.g., in the bottom of your purse or other bag for a long time. The controls are not usable when the case is in that position, but your screen is protected. This is a great protector for my new favorite gadget!",162,4

Fits snugly and covers all areas but the buttons, earphone jack, and screen.  Covers all but a sliver of the silver bezel on the front and I believe it will stop any scratches and dents happening on the bezel.

It made my used phone look new but didn't add bulk.  The price on Amazon made this case a good buy (I would not pay the price they sell for in the stores).  The only reason I gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have had issues with getting the two pieces to meet up well when putting the case on.

I'm glad I only paid a little over $3 for it!  One other thing that drives me nuts is that when it's sitting flat on my desk and I touch the screen, it doesn't sit flat because of the ""button"" on the back.  So, when I touch the screen it wobbles a lot.  It also does not have as much traction as my old case so it slides around in my car.

The bottom piece covers the bottom phone corners great but the top piece does not cover the corners completely (like the bottom piece does). Great colors and on the inside of the case has a felt cloth so the case does not scratch the back of iphone. Which is a great feature because all other cases we have had, have done just that... scratched the iphone. So when iphone is out of the case it looks horrible.

It is hard to remove because of the design has you push on piece and pull on another to get it unlatched. The other issue is that it's bottom is a little thick so it can get in the way on some accessories. (did not work with a keyboard i found, but works great with my alarm clock.)

Other then that this case literally SAVED my ipod. I fell down the stair and my ipod flew onto hard tile/cement and came out with only a little crack on the corner of the screen. It could have been WAY worse but the case saved it. Also I do like how the case looks and feels in my hand.",130,35

I bought this as a replacement case when my first iFrogz case became dull and scratched after a year of normal wear and tear. I had been pleased with the performance of the original, though the screen protector did produce an unusual amount of bubbles between the screen and film. My order for the replacement was damaged on arrival, and my iFrogz customer service experience was not satisfactory. It was clearly a production problem, not a shipping issue and they didn't want to deal with it at all. My intent had been to give them a heads up as much as to request a replacement. (So, they clearly don't care about quality control.) Amazon took care of it, but the replacement for that also appeared more flimsy than the original. I was suspicious (same screen protector issue, too) and what do you know- the pieces of plastic holding it together on the sides totally busted shortly thereafter, out of nowhere.

It's annoying enough to make the case not worth using.

The only redeemer is that it came with a screen protector, and it was actually cheaper to buy this case then most other protectors on the site, so at least I have that out of the deal. I can't speak to the quality of the screen protector as I already have a Phone Devil on my screen, but if that ever fails me, at least I have a backup now.

The quality of the case is excellent. It has two segments which attach at the middle-lower portion and cover the phone. The edge of the case extends over the edge of the phone very slightly (maybe a millimeter) and this protects the edge and front against flat surface damage.

My only complaint is that the hard shell plastic case can accumulate dust inside it and needs to be opened once in a while to be cleaned. I think this is a problem with almost all cases anyways, so it's nothing special.

I've dropped my iPhone 3G numerous times while I had this case and it protected the phone very well. It's not too large and it looks slick. The coloring (available in multiple colors) is great and the case itself is very durable. Provides excellent protections and beats almost any rubber case.

I treat my phone very carefully and have never dropped yet, yet the fragile pieces of plastic that connect the top of the case to the bottom of the case break off very easily.  In my experience, they break within the first 12 months.

But I like the minimal bulk of these cases, and they seem to do a decent job of protecting the phone (although I have never dropped my phone to find out).

It's sleek, feels GREAT in your hand, feels very sturdy, and is super stylish (in a versatile way that is great for the male or female user).  I would have given 5 stars but for some reason mine doesn't ""click"" into place; i.e. I don't have to press the button to remove the bottom case.  But it fits so perfectly there is no danger of the bottom slipping off.  I also took away one star because the design does expose too much of the phone around the volume & mute keys.

If you are constantly shoving your phone in and out of your pocket as I do, then skip this phone case. It seems to lean more toward being decorative, than being a work horse. Admittedly, though, it is a rather cool case. Amazon doesn't have the ""4"" yet, but I thought I would warn people

Being a cheapskate at times, I just couldn't bring myself to spend $25 or more for a case (especially when I was fairing okay with a naked iPhone).

Anyways - installation was literally a snap.  I found it to be well designed, slim yet rugged enough for the everyday use my phone endures.  Since I don't work outdoors and have only dropped my phone once - I didn't feel the need for a bulky case like the otter.

The screen protector is actually one of the better ones I've used - fits neatly, applies very easily (and accurately) and most importantly -- hasn't impacted my touchscreen use / function at all.

I bought two of these cases - my wife's only complaint is it feels a little too smooth and she's afraid she'll drop her phone.  I think the case has enough texture (soft velvet feel) to stay easily in my grip - yet not too much texture to stick to my clothes when I retrieve from my pocket.

Update after 75 days of using the product:  If you carry your phone in a purse or set it down on a lot of hard / rough surfaces - the color coating starts to wear off and you see bits of shiny under it.  Not a big deal, but thought I would share.

I waited about 3 weeks and have not experienced any of those problems.  In fact the case still looks pretty much brand new!!  I am not too hard on things but am not really careful either.  Anyway what I really love about this case is that it fits the phone so perfectly, and mine came with a clear face/screen protector - meaning that I did not need to buy it separately.  Considering the price of the case - many vendors charge just as much just for the screen protector.  I have the orange/black version and after 3 weeks it still looks great - in fact still looks new unless you look very closely - then you can see a couple of small scuff marks where I dropped the phone, but you do have to look for the marks.  I have purchased a couple of other cases for my iphone but none of them fit or look as nice (in my opinion) as this case.  All things considered the I-frogz case was a much better value than the other cases I purchased.

It is definitely nice looking and protective, consisting of two parts that ""clip"" together, and allow access to all of the buttons and ports on the phone.

Unfortunately, the good looks and functionality of this case only lasted about a month.  Small pieces of plastic that are supposed to clip the two halves of the case together broke off quite easily, and now the case no longer stays on the phone while taking it out of my pocket.  I've only had the device for a couple of months now, and I think I'm quite gentle with it -- never dropping it, treating it roughly, or excessively removing the case.

Also, the texture keeps it from collecting a lot of lint and whatnot from your pocket.

The downside is that I replaced it twice in the first two months of ownership.  The first one started tearing in an upper corner and the second one had a chunk snap off near the clips that slide together.

Thankfully, the store where I purchased the case offered a one year warranty at no-cost, so they've replaced it for free, but already my third one has had color scrape off the back.

The color has also faded quite rapidly and scratched off too easily.  The case itself does not fit flush with the screen and causes the screen protector film to bubble in the bottom corners.  Additionally, the felt on the inside has permanently discolored my brand-new white 3GS.  One of my friends had the same case and experienced all of the same problems.  I am not rough with my phone, and take very good care of it so it you are looking for anything reliable then this is not for you.

The sleeve wore out so I decided to try this case out.  The case itself is a pretty nice rubberized plastic and was a nice tight fit (I kept the skin on it for added protection).  This case comes with a clear screen protector, which is pretty necessary since the front is not protected.  The case comes in 2 pieces - bottom and top - that are clipped in the back by something that resembles a big button.  This is the part that adds a little bulk, but nothing I would object too much to.

The only negative I can say about this case is that the rubberized material ""chips"" easily.  I bought the red/black cover and i can see the color chipping away at small spots that may contact any loose change or anything else in my pocket.

1. It doesn't fit over my screen protecter very well. One corner of the screen protecter keeps coming up.
2. It's leaving marks on my phone. When I took the cover off the other day I saw that it had rubbed the red coloring onto my phone. Luckily this wiped off but I don't like the fact that its rubbing against the phone.
3. This is my biggest problem with the case. IT DOESN'T STAY ON!! This case does not lock together and it is constantly coming apart. I find that if put my phone in my pocket that when I pull it back up I end up pulling just the case and not the phone. What good is a case if its constantly coming off!

I do not like this case and would not suggest anyone to buy it! I would suggest finding one that either slips over the phone (like the gel type covers) or one that truly snaps around the phone.",210,133

However, about a month after I bought it, I noticed that the clip that holds the black and red parts together had broken on one side.  The phone has never been dropped, nor do I just toss it in my pocket - it ""lives"" in a leather protective belt case.

Last week (around the first of November, 2009), I noticed that the other side was broken, and that the black part had cracked from the side of the round ""dot"" that connects it to the red part all the way to the bottom of the case.  It's now just held together by the sticker on the inside of the case.

I tend to baby my electronics - my iPhone replaced a 20GB iPod Photo that still works and looks nearly new.  So, after just over four months, I have to say I'm not impressed with the way the iFrogz case is made, nor with the way it held up.

I am extremely careful with my phone but it did take a small fall to the ground 2 days ago (about a 2 foot fall) and the ifrogz case did absolutely NOTHING to protect it - my iphone screen shattered!  I took the phone in to ATT, and OF COURSE, they did nothing besides sending me over to Apple.  Apple actually told me my phone broke due to the flimsy ifrogz case, and they actually don't sell the case for this very reason.  It sucks! To prove a point, the Apple guy took his iphone out of his pocket and hit it on the counter 4-5 times in a row to show me that a case should absorb impact and protect your phone.  He also shared his opinion that ATT should cover the cost to fix my screen since they sold me a faulty product.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,1.0,negative,"I'm a bit perplexed by some of the positive reviews of this product.

I have had my new iPhone less than three months and in that time, I have had TWO iFrogz cases!
Being extremely careful and caring of my iPhone, I noticed the coloring/paint of the iFrogz case began to wear-away after only about one month. My hands are never sweaty when handling my phone so I'm not sure what would account for such quick wear other than poor construction and/or design.

My primary issue is with how these products break so very easily. The first fell off the arm of my chair, about two feet down onto a rug, but cracked the corner of the casing completely; and so I purchased another one.

As with the first, I noticed how the bottom portion does not slide effortlessly into the top when fitting it onto the iPhone. The little wedges on either side which appear to be to help guide the black, bottom section on, break almost immediately. I have one friend who repeats the exact same issue. The second never did fit completely onto my iPhone and again, has begun to wear and discolor after only about a month/month and a half.

This is NOT a product for the iPhone. It does not give the phone either protection or a problem-free casing resolution.

Purchase something else until iFrogz begins to offer better quality in their products.",238,155
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,"I bought this case and it fits looks great.  The only thing is the plastic screen cover develops bubbles and gets filmy, but easily wipes off.  Good purchase, though.",29,156

That said, it's not perfect.  Dust & dirt can still get between the case and the phone and you should take it off every few days to clean it off else the dirt gets embedded in the black plastic back of the phone...I wonder why apple didn't continue to use aluminum like the original iPhone?  Also the bottom half of the case comes off fairly easily and the little tabs will break off before long.  One of mine did in the first week but it doesn't affect the performance of the case at all.",134,157

This is a hard shell case (not soft gel-like) but it has a smooth, almost velvety feel. The smooth surface allows the phone to be easily pulled out of my pants pocket without sticking. The case is composed of two pieces (upper and lower) that slide together and form a perfect fit to the iphone 3G. One of the reasons I wanted a case for the iphone was that the phone felt a little to slim in my hand. This case adds just enough ""bulk"" yet the phone is still sleek and thin.",110,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,3.0,neutral,I like this case and have used it about five months. I have dropped my iphone a handful of times with no damage. Last week I dropped my iphone (while it was in this case) and my screen cracked. I am not sure if this case has enough shock absorption. I am getting a new iphone and will get a new silicone case for it - hopefully with better shock absorption.,71,159
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,5.0,positive,"This is a strong, elegant case. Glides on and fits evenly and snugly, some may even feel it fits too snugly. The benefit of the snug fit is that helps prevent most dirt from getting under the case to be ground into and scratch the finish of your phone. There is also a velvet pad on the inside back of the upper and lower pieces that keeps the case itself from scratching the phone.

This case is slim enough to fit into a holster and its matte finish makes it easier to grab and comfortable to hold. I can also say, from experience, the case also protects the phone impacts if dropped while the finish of the case remains pretty durable. Please note: I can say this even after (clumsily and most embarrassingly) dropping my phone on tile, concrete and asphalt.

The only negative I could see is that this case was nearly impossible to remove initially and is still TRULY difficult to remove. This, however, is not much of a problem if you do not use a dock. I remove my case only to clean my phone because I use a cable to charge and sync. Even video cables (Apple branded and generic composite cables) work well with this case. I am actually considering buying a second of another color...

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL2CKW,4.0,positive,"Pros: This case looks awesome! I have the blue, and the metallic sheen it has is very cool.  I wish the whole case was this color, instead of just the top third.  It has a great feel to it too, a slight velvety feel that sits in your hand nicely.  I also like how a thin strip of the chrome bezel shows through.

Cons:
1. The ""button"" on the back where the two pieces of the case lock together makes the phone rock when its sitting on a table, making it harder to type and navigate the touch screen.
2. On my case, the two pieces don't line up exactly when going on, the bottom part and the top part don't sit over each other exactly as they should so I have to press one part down with my finger.  This also seems to prevent the ""button"" from locking all the way.  This issues hasn't limited the functionality of the case yet, but I assume the it will get worse the more I take the case on and off.

Very classy, professional looking. A mat finish, not shiny.

I have dropped my phone a few times in the 5 months I've had it, and the back ring around the button has broken off, half of it, so it's now a half moon. And there is a chunk missing on one side where the 2 pieces come together.

Only taken it off once, when I had to take the phone in to be repaired, the button on the bottom stopped working (from dropping it maybe?) When I took off the cover, 2 little pieces of the case fell out, the tabs on either side. My phone however was not scratched at all. The back and sides are beautifully pristine, not a mark or scratch. The case is much easier to put on and off though, now that the tabs and the ring are broken off!

The big draw back: I'm not actually sure how to get this cover off. It's been on since the week I got my iphone. The rigidity of the case prevents it from docking in the Griffin AM/FM radio charger. I ended up getting a cheaper, uglier version so that it docks okay.

The button on the back that clips in is just a hair shy of being flush, the case seems just a tad too small vertically, but it stays put. The case is hard to remove, but I don't see myself removing it often.

It comes with a plastic screen protector. It looks okay, I suspect it would get scratched up pretty quickly. I bought an Invisible Shield from  Zagg and put that on instead.

The case is a little grippy which is nice, but it doesn't attract lint or make it too hard to pull out of a pocket.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,3.0,neutral,"I was fairly disappointed with this case.

First off, I found that the case was more delicate than the phone itself, preventing it from performing its function very well. Less than a month of use, one of the tabs that hold the two parts of the case together broke off just from taking the case off. Because of this, it sometimes comes off when I take it out of my pocket. Also, part of the edge near the tabs began to chip off as well. The case seems to be much more flimsy than it seems. The color is pretty nice, but at some spots does not match (it looked purplish at one spot), but it seems cheap; the paint around the circle on the back started to also chip off after less than a month.
One positive thing I can say about this case is that I got it for a cheaper price (it was about $5 when I got it).

This case is good as a back up or temporary case if it's cheap, but as I'm writing this, the price for this case is $18. At that price, it's not worth it, but if it drops again, then it would be worth it if you don't intend to use it for long periods at a time.",219,25

The blue metallic color was nice and deep, almost purplish.  But since I'd consider myself a heavy iPhone user, particularly while I was nursing my daughter and stuck in one spot for hours at a time (she would invariably fall asleep in my lap, and any movement would wake her up), I soon started to see a wear pattern in the metallic paint appear after only a couple of weeks.  The paint began to discolor to a gross yellowed tint around the portions of the phone where I tended to grip it most often, mainly the sides.  After a few more months some of the paint began to chip off entirely, revealing the ugly silver metal underneath.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  For $30, I'd expect a case to hold up better than that.

That said, I give it three stars because it's protected my iPhone reasonably well; I've dropped the phone a number of times and there's nary a scratch on it.  I'll probably get another one when I hit the year mark since I see that Amazon is selling this case for a fraction of the price I'd originally paid for it.",215,39

I would recommend instead to use a soft rubber case that elastically fits and protects the phone.

That hole completely ruins the aesthetic appeal of most cases around; the Apple logo really isn't that important. The fact that this case doesn't have that hole single-handedly prompted me to get this case before any others.

As far as durability, the other review are correct in that the two small tabs on either side and the thin, lower plastic bar across the lower front of the phone are flimsy and break off quickly.

The case is good in many ways: great design, good color, good material, good protection and great price. The color wears off a little bit along the edges over time but not a big deal.

There is only one major problem, the two pieces does not lock tightly. the top piece keep sliding off from the phone, and this is getting worse over time. Whenever I try to get my phone out of pocket I grabbed the case and it is sliding off. This also creates another problem, since it constantly coming off-on, a lot of dirt and dust will go between the phone and the case. Every now and then I have to remove the case and clean my phone, and there is a lot of dust on the phone!

I bought a new one to replace it, and the new one stinks.  It's a looser fit, so the case wiggles around the phone and the plastic isn't as rigid (contributing to the loose fit).  In addition, the side ""fingers"" that locked the upper & lower pieces together are gone, so the corners of the lower piece now grab my pocket EVERY time I take it out.

This allows dust and debis to get under the screen protector, which, if you are OCD about dust and imperfections like I am, will drive you nuts.

The worst part is the two pieces of the case don't hold together well. Now, every time I take it out of my pocket I leave half the case behind. There are tabs on the side that are supposed to hold the case parts together but those broke off in short order and now the case falls apart when you try to plug in to recharge or put in head phones.

My problem with the iPhone has been that while it needs protecting, i hate the usual cases as they either add too much bulk, or they don't slide in and out of a pocket easily.

I think these offer a middle of the road solution to both.  Not too bulky, and while not slippery, aren't as sticky as the silicon types.

And the case is great! I've had it for a couple of months now and have had none of the problems others have (possibly the manufacturer fixed the flaws?). No color fading, no tabs breaking and the case stays snapped together pretty tight. I also take the bottom of the case off every night to dock my iphone and everything still fits tight and snug.

Also, I was fumbling with a bunch of bags the other day and my phone dropped right out of my hand onto the hard floor. The case came apart when it hit the ground, but it didn't break, chip, or anything! AND my phone didn't have a scratch on it!

Cons:
-Very poor fit, it slides on sloppy and you have to be careful all the little tabs fit in together correctly.  One of the side tabs partially snapped off the first time I put it together, the plastic was so thin it almost seemed like manufacturing scrap rather than integral to the case.
-The black paint began flaking off after about a month of pocket use.
-The thin piece at the bottom of the phone by the home button snapped because it did not fit snuggly against the phone.
-Due to the poor fit, sometimes when grabbing the phone out of my pocket the case would separate.
-The poor fit lets in a lot of dust and lint.

I never once dropped the phone with this case on, so all of those issues were just normal use.

As there are some good reviews for this case, it appears they might have very poor manufacturing tolerances because some people seem to get a snug fit, while mine in particular fit horribly.

But as several other reviewers have pointed out, the design is terrible. The case never slides fully closed -- it always seems to be just a hair short of locked. It also doesn't cover the chrome ring on the phone. But the worst thing is the thin ""fingers"" on the bottom of the case that slide into the top (usually) to keep it locked. They are beyond fragile and unless lined up exactly right, break when you try and slide the case closed. I've tried two cases now and this will be my last because of this. You don't even have to slide the case all the way off -- if it even slips open a bit (since it never fully locks) and then gets pushed closed, the ""fingers"" will break. If the manufacturer would beef these up a bit or change the mechanism, this would be the best case around.

UPDATE: I contacted iFrogz, and even though I hadn't purchased the case directly from them they offered to send me a new one. Best of all, the case has been redesigned and doesn't have the ""fingers"" to break off and it fits much more tightly. I've only had it for a few days but it seems to be a much better design.

It broke on the black part on the bottom side because it couldn't take the pressure of the case on the phone so it crack in three places and it didn't work anymore so I would advise to look for a different case that is not made in the same way as this one,68,123

When I received the product, I simply decided not to use the screen protector because of what others have posted.  I have had absolutely no issues with this cover.  In fact, I dropped my phone and rather than the phone catching the scratches, the cover did.  I also had no problem with the fit of this product.  You won't be disappointed if you decide to purchase this item.  (I purchased the pink/black cover)",97,124

However I had the case for a week when I noticed it was starting to almost peel on the sides. It was very strange. I returned it and the person said they had never seen that happen before. They gave me another one - no peeling this time! But I have noticed the color has faded SO much and now it's a weird light blue/green/gold color.

Other than the two issues I had with this case I've loved it. It has really protected my phone - given it a couple scratches on the back, but that's okay.",115,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,2.0,negative,"I upgraded to an iphone 3gs and picked out this case for the way it looks.  Its a nice design, I like the colors, and it feels good.  However, I quickly found a few issues with it.

1.  The screen protector is a film that is placed on the screen.  I had issues getting it on without a lot of bubbles, but finally achieved that.. but when i put the outer shell on it caused the corners to bubble up.. plus I didn't like how the screen looked with it on.. so I ended up removing it.

2.  The case comes in two pieces that lock together in the back with a round button like object.  Its raised up slightly so when I lay the phone down it wobbles a bit.  Not bad, but just enough to be annoying.

3.  on the back of the case where the case comes together, there is a small plastic lip that bent up slightly and made the case difficult to get together.  I finally got it on, but the bottom lip is a little chewed up.

4.  Possibly because of #3, everytime I go to unplug my phone from the charger or computer the case comes apart and I have to wrestle the ends back together.. and run into number 3 again.

Overall, it had a nice look, but after a week of using it I've already discarded it and am looking for another case.",242,126

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B001CL9M7S,4.0,positive,"I bought one of these for my new iPhone 3G a year ago, since I am likely someday to be reported for cell phone abuse. Between my pockets, poor juggling skills, and children entertained by the phone, I knew this thing wouldn't last long. The case looks pretty nice, a kind of a muted metallic sheen with good access to buttons, camera, headphone jack, and sync port. The ifrogz logo is understated, black on black near the bottom of the back surface and much less blatant than some other cases I found. It has a somewhat rubberized texture that doesn't slide around when you set the phone down. The screen protector was ok, nothing great, and it didn't seem to mess up the screen input.

So what happened? One year later it's been dropped on concrete, scratched by pocketed car keys, and tossed by kids. It's got scratches on the back and a few small chips of coating have come off. The screen protector keeps getting more bubbles in it and looks a little smudgy. But the phone is still unscratched, and generally seems to work. There's some battery discharge problems, so Apple tech support is switching out the phone for me (barely under warranty!), and I'm buying a new case for it that doesn't have scratches. I'd probably list it as 4.5 stars, only slightly knocked down for not being indestructible, but really a great case, especially for the price. I'd recommend checking it out.",246,128

My case broke after 2 weeks, and I never even dropped it. It's a snazzy looking case and looks nice on the phone but it has to many flaws.

It comes in 2 pieces and when you put it on your iphone it connects in the middle. That is the biggest flaw. Most people hold their phone by the middle not the ends. So when you grab the phone or move it around in your hand/pocket you tend to disconnect the pieces.

The other issue is the connecting flaps that plug into eachother to complete the case. They are flimsy and will break easily after reattaching many times. My right side flap has already broken off and now its chipped where it was. Also the color blue is wearing off on the back of the circle already.

I'm throwing it away.",73,152

The bottom piece came off within a week and the side where the volume controls are was gone soon after. Then the hole that holds the case together in the back cracked in half, but I cannot complain about that because seconds later the tabs that keep both sides attached snapped off. If you want a durable case this is not for you, but if you just want something too keep your phone from getting scratches from keys or something this could be ok.

I wish the whole case was this color, instead of just the top third.  It has a great feel to it too, a slight velvety feel that sits in your hand nicely.  I also like how a thin strip of the chrome bezel shows through.

Cons:
1. The ""button"" on the back where the two pieces of the case lock together makes the phone rock when its sitting on a table, making it harder to type and navigate the touch screen.
2. On my case, the two pieces don't line up exactly when going on, the bottom part and the top part don't sit over each other exactly as they should so I have to press one part down with my finger.  This also seems to prevent the ""button"" from locking all the way.  This issues hasn't limited the functionality of the case yet, but I assume the it will get worse the more I take the case on and off.

If they offered this case without the ""button"" on the back, allowing it to sit flat on a table it would be a 5-star plus product.",205,160

The slider style is nice because you can remove the bottom to place your iphone in it's cradle.  However, in my case this is where the case failed.  From what I consider normal use, the black plastic near the connection between the 2 halves cracked and broke off.  I found the extra piece in my pocket.

Can't speak to the color fading issue but in less than several times used, I have broken a tab on the side.  So be very, very careful with how you insert the case parts together.  Have used this case with a cozip.  The cozip is easier on and off and provides similar but better overall protection with some face covered.

Unfortunately although I like the design of this case, the tabs on the side are prone to break with light use if you are not extra careful with them.  I only noticed it was gone after putting it on.  Used it maybe three times.

Screen protector seems to be a casemate brand.  Had those on 2g and 3g but for some reason even applied perfect will create a bubble on a corner somewhere.  With the iFrogz added, you get two additional bubbles to go 3 for 4.  Casemate seems to be slightly off here.  If you apply it good luck.  It's a good screen protector but seems hard to work with a case like this.",193,172

Also, the price is half on Amazon as it was in the AT&T store making an online purchase a no-brainer. As others have mentioned, the blue color is really much darker and more metallic than it seems in the product shots.

I had a tough time sliding it on in the beginning, in fact, I almost bent one of the pieces that it almost didn't fit. That said, once I got it on, it seems to do a good job of keeping it protected. The plastic film screen protector is kind of a pain. I couldn't really get the corners to fit so I ended up cutting the bottom pieces so it would stay put. The bottom corners have a little bit of a triangular fit so it makes it hard for the film to stay on. It's decent though. I hope this case lasts for awhile because I've seen people go through may different ones because they keep it in their pocket.

This skin is harder than the picture might suggest, and it adds very little bulk to the size of the iphone.  It does cover the apple logo on the back, but that does not bother me one bit.

The case is good looking and feels like it might offer some good protection for the iphone, although, I am sure that there are other cases out there that offer more protection.  I have no problem reaching any of the buttons or charging the iphone.

I have bumped my phone too many times to count and the phone has dropped from a table top, 6 or so times (on the flat surface of the case).  The case is durable and has protected my phone.

The only problem I can see is the screen protector (not included, you have to have one of those specific-to-the-iphone screen protectors) gets pushed up a bit at the bottom corners.  Not a big deal, seeing as there's been a slight bubble in the area for couple weeks now and it hasn't caused us to pull up the protector.

Everything worked flawlessly and the combination of the shield and case was excellent.  It preserved the form factor of the iphone while providing some protection from impact.  The blue is a very classy shade and is not ostentatious at all.  I did notice that the metallic finish rubbed a little bit and the plastic is not as heavy duty as I had thought.  The button on the back was actually quite nice for grip and was not an issue at all.  The fact that the case has felt inside is a plus and prevented scratching (only where there was felt).  However, I noticed that when I took the case off today, that the unfelted areas had allowed buildup of some lint and dirt and because the dirt was trapped between the case and the phone actually scratched the finish a bit.

Other than those things, I loved the case and would have given it 4-5 stars.  Until i noticed that the thin plastic had broken on one of the sides and was cracking on the other.  While slick looking, these cases are not very durable.  I would recommend them for very casual use but not for what I see as normal phone/personal assistant usage.

The reason I only gave it three stars, was for some reason this case made it so I could not take pictures was the flash.  I guess the way it was designed, the flash would reflect off of the case and all of my pictures would be extremely washed out.  I was quite disappointed because I had read that this particular case was designed to prevent that, as it had a separate hole for the lens and flash so they wouldn't impact each other.  Sadly, that just wasn't the case.  I've since got a nice Otterbox Commuter case and it didn't have this same problem.

One additional note.  It turns out that charging the iPad 2 and another unit can be problematic.  I found that if I plug in the iPad 2 first, then plug in one other unit, both units will charge.  However, if I do the reverse (especially if trying to charge a smart phone) then the iPad 2 may not charge.  Fortunately, the iPad 2 does indicate that its not charging, so I get a visual indication if I messed up.

The wires do get damaged easily so be carful when handling them.  The microphone works alright and the jack plugs in firmly.  Again, they look great, but looks only get you so far.  When it comes to the listening experience, that is when the cheap price comes into play.

  The sound coming from the ear buds to me is above average quality, but with a trade off.  You can hear a faint buzzing sound in the background, the louder the audio, the louder the buzz.  To me, I could not stand it so I just gave them away.  All in all, this is a good buy.

The only way it could be improved is to have just one ear piece instead of two.  I don't think it's safe or advisable to drive with both ears blocked.

First impression: cheap flimsy plastic

Since I'm not one to waste money, I went ahead and use it. It snapped on and fit perfectly and protect my phone well.

I'm happy with it as it slips in and out of my pocket easily and the rubberized feel helps keep it from slipping out of my fingers.

The problem came when I had to remove the cover.  There was no way for me to do that without damaging the case. A couple hook pieces broke off and the case no longer hold together very well.

Upon removing the cover the first time, I noticed a few scratches on my phone from it. But the scratches were minor compare from the scratch I got for dropping my phone without any cover. So I cover my phone back up.  Some of the black color around the rim got rubbed off over the year.

After more than 1.5 years, I'm not ready to buy new phone yet, but I certainly need a new case because I don't want to start using duct tape to hold this $3 case together. Still, I certainly got more than my money's worth with this case.",206,11

But it fits the phone well and does not come loose and the design is not fading away or peeling off. I also really like that it has a smooth, rubberized feel to it.

Most bluetooths have a ear hook that swivels to sit securely over the ear.  This piece of shit bluetooth cliks back and forth and does not even secure properly around or over the ear.  It is made POORLY and if you want to save yourself the trouble of buying something you absolutely CAN NOT USE, take my advise and BUY SOMETHING ELSE.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,3.0,neutral,"Got this phone to replace my Samsung Vibrant.  Got tired of Android phones.  Yup, I can't believe I went back to a Windows Mobile platform.  I needed a physical on/off button to hang up or dial people.  As strange as it may seem, the Android on/off button would not work during a call on my Samsung Vibrant.

I bought this unlocked phone for calls and text. I carry my T-mobile G-Slate tablet for internet functionality.

The phone that arrived was an AT&T branded phone.  Fortunately I could slip in my T-Mobile SIM card and it worked.  Although it kept rebooting the first 20 minutes after I inserted the T-Mobile SIM.  Also, I'm not sure if this was a refurbished unit.  The outside casing looked new, but when I removed the battery there was this white sticker that looked like it was placed there by a 3rd party refurbished team.

Regardless, this was well worth the price.  Again, I needed a basic phone.  The earpiece and speakerphone is loud, on par with the Samsung Vibrant.  It boots up in about 45 seconds.  It receives Edge internet only on T-Mobile.

Ringtones are NOT very loud and there were not a good selection of ringtones.

UPDATE 12/18/2011:  I downgraded my review of this phone from 5 stars to 3 stars.  The issue is dust collected under the screen.  There is no way to get rid of it.  Also, cannot see screen in direct sunlight.

Battery lasts an entire day (24 hours).  Again, it's not Android and it doesn't multi-task, that's why the battery lasts so long.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0051I5I3K,4.0,positive,"It has only been two days since I got the phone so rating this product is a little premature.  If you have been using a Blackberry, this phone might frustrate you a little bit.  The keyboard sticks a little. You have to add a period at the end of all sentences instead of the software doing it for you.  The comma is actually not featured on the keyboard, but as a symbol that you have to access from a symbol list.  Having said that, all of this is very tolerable. The track wheel seems very sturdy, but you are better off clicking instead of dialing. Reception has been really good everywhere I have gone.  The sound tends to be soft and so are the different rings.  I like the display.  Overall it seems like a very good, but simple smartphone.  When you buy this article, make sure they include a data cable with it.  It should come with it, but it was not packed with my order.  It is a proprietary samsung design so finding it would be difficult.  They didn't even have it at the AT&T store, Best Buy or RadioShack around where I live.  I hope this review helps.",201,16

The defective models had defective charging ports, phone lock wouldn't unlock once activated, phone menu was not always accessible. It's hit or miss with this one. Most phones were available through unlocked cellphone kings and their customer service is not good. They refused to replace one of the phones.

Probably the best sound I have ever had (including my Blackberry) Pretty easy to use, other than larger keys hardly light up and can be very difficult to see in the dark.

I would caution to only order if you are already very familiar with the specific phone you want, as these discontinued phones may not have a user's manual.

I opened the package to see it contained a rubberized bluetooth keyboard and about 4 pages of instructions.  I opened the package and found no USB-> mini-USB charge cord for the keyboard.  Luckily I had a spare laying around the house.  Once charged (admittedly for only approximately a half hour) I turned on the keyboard.  The keyboard was recognized by my Samsung Galaxy S II phone and pairing was as simple as following the onscreen instructions and inputting the 6 digit password.  Here is where things went awry.

The product is small as warned by previous reviewers; however, I could have been able to work around that.  I immediately opened Quickoffice and created a new word document.  The bluetooth keyboard only picked up intermittent keystrokes.  Sometimes it would pick up the wrong key entirely.  I though this may be a problem with Quickoffice, but when I tried it in a simple text window I had the same results.  I thought it may have been the result of a low battery, so I allowed the keyboard to charge for 4 more hours.  To my dismay, I yielded the same results.

I am returning this product as defective/not working as advertised.  It did not work with my Samsung Galaxy S II as a previous commenter has noted.  Better luck to anyone who takes a chance on this keyboard... I do not recommend this product.",272,37

The cradle supports the phone just fine with and without a kickstand case attached.  I actually found it a bit more stable / less wobbly with the case on verse mounting it without a case.

Pros:
- Phone goes on very easily using only one hand to mount.
- Supports phone both with and without a case.
- Includes USB cable.
- Charges and syncs just as advertised with a single cable.
- Sharp Looking

Cons:
- Small lightweight base allows it to slide around on desk when pushing/swiping screen.
- Cable takes a little work to mount into cradle when you first set it up.
- Difficult to remove phone from cradle with just 1 hand.
- Phone is a little wobbly/top heavy.  again because of the small lightweight base)

As stated the us cable included is white which clashed with the style of the black station. The little plastic holder snaps into place but is an awkward fit. The little plastic tabs broke right off of it while trying to juggle the piece. This resulted in one cut thumb, a lot of inappropriate language on my part, and an unusable dock. I'm returning it and giving up on finding a dock that will actually fit the phone with it's cover.

When it didn't work with that phone, I tried it with my Galaxy Nexus (with a TPU gel cover on), and it works fine.

Both phones have the same charging cable and wall adapter, so it doesn't really make sense.

I'll keep it for my Nexus, buy something else for the S3. It's an otherwise nice-looking, functional charging dock.

The main complaint I have is that it's just too unstable with your s2 in it.
It's pretty much at risk of being knocked over with any touch, or brushing against the cable etc... honestly.

So if you simply want a nightstand and charger, and you'll never plan on touching it while docked, then go ahead.

As for the design, it is clever in its appearance but really unsuitable for the Nexus Galaxy.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005NJ6EPI,2.0,negative,"This product is currently the only one of its kind for the Samsung Galaxy S2, so I bought it by default. I like the idea of it, but it is poorly engineered.

- Only the USB jack holds the phone in place. This means that when you try to interact with the phone while it's docked it wobbles badly. Having so much weight and tension on the mini USB port is a tremendous engineering oversight, and will likely become trouble some day soon.

- The curved design is nice, but it's made from acrylic, so it's exponentially lighter than it should be. This means that when you try to interact with the phone while it's docked it likes to scoot around.

- All models of this phone are black, and the base is black, but for some reason the included proprietary cable is bright white. It's an annoying incongruence.

The design of the plug doesn't allow the phone to fit all the way down and sit flush with the holder.  This allows the phone to tilt left or right.  very unstable.  also the size of this phone for this stand is to big.  It wants to fall over backwards if touched.  This is not worth $20.  $9.99 maybe is a better price for it.  I give it 2 stars because it actually does charge the phone and it will hold the phone in place if you don't touch it.

Putting the phone in landscape mode on the stand makes it sit precariously close to the edge of the lip that holds it in. Again, a slight nudge on top and it slides right out.

3. M phone, the samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket had to have the protective rubber case modified for it to fit properly in the cradle.  I suspect most phone covers will not allow a proper connection.  So you must remove the case, or modify it, as I have.

Since the phone cables do not communicate with my computers (windows 7 & samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket), having them used with your computer is useless.  They should have supplied an ac adapter, and advertised to be used without a computer.  This would have been far more honest and accurate.

I like the dock enough that I won't send it back but will get a clear or black piece of plastic to glue the dock to that will widen the base and stabilize it.

And as the others mentioned, why the white cord when the rest is black?

You have to use your own power adapter because one is not included with the stand. That again makes this product incomplete.

For $50 the better product is the Samsung kickstand for the Galaxy SII. It includes a solid stand, an extra battery and a place to charge the battery while it is not in the phone. It's not perfect either but is a much better value and looks professional.

Pushing on buttons or the screen will just slide the dock around, you almost have to use two hands to perform any actions while the phone is docked.  Due to the design when docked it becomes very top heavy as well.

Also would prefer it used a standard USB cable instead of a proprietary one, which is white (ugh) and very short.

So, not the most stable dock, must use included cable, and you still need a USB Wall Charger if you want to Charge with AC.  Even with all that, it's usable, and works with cases.  I use this one at work, and will continue to use the EVO Power dock at home, which is a bit heftier, but required case removal to use.  Galaxy II S)

EDIT - 2 days later, I have to make an additional comment.  This dock works fine if all you want is a stand to charge on, or to display your alarm clock in the AM.  But, if you want a dock you can interact with, this is not it.  I can't even touch my phone in the dock without it sliding, tilting, toppling, twisting, etc.  If you need to actually interact with your phone on a dock, you will need to pony up for one that has more heft like the EVO Power or OEM version.",273,134

The mini usb cable that comes with it is way too short. Its hard to install and the connectors that secures the usb end to the base feels cheap.

My biggest gripe is when you try to pick up the phone you'll pick up the whole base. You'll need to use two hands to pry the phone off the base and sometimes it'll feel like the the dock has a fraking Death Grip on it.",112,136

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,"Battery life is roughly double what the stock battery for my Electrify offers (US Cellular model of the Photon).  Easily lasts a solid 24 hours of moderate-heavy use.  During my initial complete discharge cycles it seemed as though it would not die.  With light use in a battery saving mode, this battery could probably last me 5 to 6 days without recharging.  Very pleased on that front.

Because the battery is about 2.5 times the size of the stock battery, it ships with another back cover.  As another reviewer says, it actually makes the phone have a better fit in my hand.  The only things I find that could be improved upon are that the kickstand is completely inaccessible to me now.  If you have fingernails, this may not be the case for you, but I have difficulty.  Also, I notice that this backing ""sticks"" a bit more than the stock backing, in that the stock cover is much easier to remove.  I'm a power user, and find myself switching batteries occasionally, and I'm always nervous that I might break this cover while removing it from the phone.  It hasn't happened yet, and I doubt it will since it feels pretty solid, but there's a chance.

Also, the phone itself is having a hard time realizing it has more battery life now.  I haven't found an app or setting yet that helps with this and can give me a solid reading of how much time or what battery percentage I still have left.  I just  know that even when the phone says 5%, I still have several hours remaining before the phone dies.",273,0

Not with this battery. Good company also. Totally warrantied if your not happy with the product at first. I just need a cover that protects the phone if it's dropped when u are using it.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,"You need to root your phone and use a battery calculation app or choose to recalibrate the battery.

I originally was very upset with the upgrade this battery gave me. I moved from the stock battery life of 4 hours to about 5-5.5 hours of battery life. This is with very heavy usage. Twitter and Facebook constantly syncing, Gmail pushing notifications and me playing games (taxing games like GTA or Super Monkey Ball) with sound up to a high level.

After installation I mostly followed the instructions (up to 4 cycles, not the 5 it asked for) not that came with the battery but within about 5 hours I was down to 5% battery life again. I came here to complain originally but decided to wait out the 5 full charge and drain cycles. While doing so I searched the web about this battery and phone and found out that Motorola phones and a few others needed to be calibrated to show an accurate measure of battery life in the status bar. I tested this by turning on every radio leaving the screen on at max. Sure enough, my phone sat at 5% battery life for the remaining hours of the work day before it died.

I have not calibrated it yet, I will either update or comment on this review within a couple of days after I've successfully done so. I just wanted to give this initial information and to confirm that this battery is an excellent investment.

The battery itself starts off great and has a long life - I think a lot of the negative reviewers saying it had no effect just didn't recalibrate the battery meter.

Unfortunately , less then a week after getting the Hyperion Battery my Photon 4g totally crashed (no surprise! Worst phone ever!!) I had to remove the battery to reboot the phone and now the cover will not go back on correctly! The bottom will not snap back in ! It is extremely frustrating! Now when I hold the phone there is a clicking noise as the bottom moves around!! I really hope that Hyperion/Amazon does something to remedy this situation.

Obviously, the fact you need the new back will render all of your cases for the photon useless and it does make the phone thicker and noticeably heavier. I personally like the ""new"" feel!

I paid less than $2 for the app and it lets me setup battery profiles for my stock battery and my new hyperion battery and sets the appropriate percentage of life you have left.

Pros: Essentially doubles my battery life. Works great when paired with ""Battery monitor wiget pro""

Cons: If you use a dock or car dock you will not be able to use it unless you put your stock battery back in. The included cover is a bit tricky to remove",139,61

When you first install and charge the battery the charge indicator will show it discharging just as fast as your old battery, this is because you must train the android os to read the battery correctly. The charge will go down to 1% and then stay there for hours before running out of power. You need to completely charge and then completely discharge the battery (until the phone turns off) 5 or 6 times. After you do this the os will update the battery file and the charge indicator will give a true reading of the battery. Be patient and follow the procedure you will not be disappointed.",118,63

Also, the battery lasts 2x as long as the original, and that's with running Pandora, Facebook, and plenty of other high battery-draining apps. I highly recommend this battery to anyone who is looking to add extra battery life to their Photon. The only problem I have is I have yet to figure out how to calibrate the battery with the phone OS.

Some complaints however:
The back cover is not as solid as the stock cover. The internal clips break easily, but the overall quality is decent.
This adds a lot of bulk to the phone. For me, if I need life over design, I swap this battery into the phone, however, I try to stick with the slim battery when I can, just because of personal preference.

Pros: Adds a lot more life to your phone, obviously.
You don't have to charge as much.
If your phone is *rooted* you can calibrate the battery to give a accurate level.

Cons: you have to let your phone die 5-9 times before it manualy calibrates.
You may get inpatient waiting for it to die over and over and over.

Great battery to buy if your not ready to upgrade and you want to prolong your phones life, and with a few modification you can emulate the photon Q after you root it and use the Jelly Bean rom and add this battery and over clock it you have a whole new animal.
 Hope this helped.",135,79

I can assure you this batter WILL last 2-3 longer than your stock photon battery at an AMAZING price. but i've only had it for a week so i don't know what it will be like ina  few months. but even if it stops working after a few months, $16 is still a bargain.",124,80

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,"During the week, my stock battery would only last 6-7 hours before needing almost a full charge. Part of this maybe due to the fact that I work in a sound booth; my phone probably used a lot of power searching for 3G.

I bought this extended battery pack and on my 4th day am happy to say I have not had to charge my phone at all during the day (I charge overnight, everynight). I have not yet rooted my phone or found a battery monitor to account for the increase in battery capacity so my phone stays at 1% charge for a few hours. It has not yet shut down on me due to a complete drainage.

I am a heavy user checking email, some calls, Facebook, online apps, movies/music over wifi at home, and picture taking/video. I definitely recommend this product if you have a Motorola Photon.

Without the app the phone will only register 1650mAh, the amount of the original battery. So even when the phone says you have 0% you'll really have half the battery left. With judicious phone use this battery will easily last 2 days.

First of all, it is cute, but it is made of really cheap material. It is definitely not leather and it is very flimsy. However, I sort of expected that based on its price, so that isn't what bothered me.

What bothered me, and why I have to return it, is that the iPhone 4S camera does not work with this case. The hole cut for the camera is not large enough and all pictures have a pinkish hue because the red from the case gets in the way. I tried taking many pictures and it's all the same. There is no way to work around the fact that you will not be able to take a picture with your phone in this case.

I use the camera for different things, so I need a case that does not need to be removed for the camera to work. If you don't use the camera than this case is probably fine for you, but just know that it is a cheap case and it won't last forever.

-It's cute, and that's one of the reasons I picked it.  Looking close up in person it appears to be well made and has held up very well through it's first month of use.

2 problems though...
Unlike other flip cases which are designed in such a way that allows you to plug in the charger when the case is closed, this one DOES NOT.
The biggest problem with this case is that, when you take a flash photo, the red color of the case floods the photo with red color which makes it worthless if you use your camera in flash mode!  It ruins your photos.

The case is decent.  I wish there was a higher quality version where the rubber attaches more permanently to the plastic shell (the kids like to pull it off) in the $15 price range.  But the next step up is an OtterBox Defender, which costs $50.00.",77,0

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006SBR5TO,4.0,positive,"This is kind of a cheap imitation of an Otterbox Defender. I had an Defender on my wife's phone, but a few of the plastic clips broke as well as the lip that holds the rubber shell on. Since the phone is 2+ years old, I wasn't going to pony up the money for another Otterbox so the price was right on this.

Pros:
- It's cheap
- My wife likes the pink accent without it looking like an all-pink Barbie phone
- It's relatively sturdy for the price

Cons:
- The rubber shell doesn't attach quite as securely as the Defender; it's not a big deal but you just have to keep an eye on it
- The side buttons aren't raised (although they are marked with a small groove; coming from the Defender or the Seidio case on my phone, you kind of fumble looking for the buttons
- The rubber started to tear around the headphone jack and USB port flaps right away; I cut away the protective flaps (the case isn't at-all waterproof anyway) and it hasn't gotten worse
- The OEM USB cord was a little too wide to fit into the charging plug, although other USB cables fit fine; I took a file to the plastic around the USB port and in a few minutes the OEM cord fit fine too

To sum up, I'd give it a 3 stars (maybe 2 if this was for a brand-new phone and I had to live with it for 2+ years), but it gets an extra star for free shipping and costing less than a fast-food lunch.",271,2

A little sunscreen on my face also discolored the pink hard plastic (not to mention leaving pink lines on my face when I used the phone.)

They're a bit bulky and took an already large phone to not being able to fit in jeans pockets comfortably.

Each area can have the silicone part lifted up for easy access. the black part is a ribbed lining that is put inside the pink hard case. Because of this it doesn't fit true to size, However it works and is just a little slacked. It can also fit with the extended battery/Case backing for those who have it.

I also wanted to say that the screen protector although very good in protecting the screen, also was too short for my 9"" widescreen tablet.  I tried to cover the full screen with it, but a part of the top or bottom of the tablet was still exposed.  But that was really the only bad part of it.  Otherwise good product for the price.",141,4

I saw this in the other reviews that mentioned that but i thought it wouldn't matter for me as I was planning on cutting it down to use on a 7 inch tablet. The big thing is that I bought this for was to reduce the glare on my tablet when I use it outside. THIS IS NOT ANTI-GLARE!!, although it explicitly states that it is in the PRODUCT NAME!  If anything , it increased the glare! Also, nowhere on the packaging does it mention iEssentials. It comes in a very generic package with a picture of a tablet on it and the words ""Screen Guard Filmset"". On the back of the package are some poor instructions with bad translations from Chinese.

It was very difficult separating them and I ended up with a thin adhesive layer that I couldn't line up with the tablet screen.  On
top of that, after about 3 tries, there were a lot of bubbles and particles that stuck to the sticky part that added to the bubble surface.  I wish there had been detailed instructions of how to separate the layers and tabs to help separate them.

If places that sell these would give the dimensions, this could be avoided!  These are only 228mm wide which is far too short for a 10"" 16:9 tablet (which is what they show in the image on this page, a 16:9 AR tablet.  FAIK the image may be of a 9"" tablet!).  The height of these are only 156mm which is also still too short for a 16:9 AR 10"" tablet, but not as bad as the width is.  I also don't think these are for 4:3 aspect ratio tablets, but since I don't have any 4:3 tablets I CANNOT be sure of that.  Looks like they may be made for some oddball aspect ratio.  All you can do is measure your tablet's screen then see if these dimensions will work well for it.  Again, these are 228mm x 156mm.

I own 5 tablets, and several phones that I have put screen protectors like this one, so this is not my first rodeo.  I have never had one that was just impossible to successfully install until now.  Maybe there is some special trick to installing this one?  I will never know because they included ZERO product description or instructions.  As others have noted, it's hard to even tell which side to apply.  I thought maybe I had just made a mistake with the first attempt, so was super careful with the second, but still didn't work.  I think if you can get it to install, without creasing or bubbles, it looks like it might work well, so I will give them 2 stars, but for me, it was just a big waste of money.",151,23

But I've had it.  $14.99 was an exceedingly high price to pay in my mind.  For approx. 5 years I subscribed to the LA Times (while living there) for $9.99.  It is still $9.99.  That is the right price point in my mind for this kind of subscription.  But, I have a soft spot for the newspaper industry and the Globe after living far away for so long so I justified the $14.99 cost.

To receive a notice that the price was incurring a 100% increase to $29.99 was untenable.  What additional service should I expect?  Formatting errors on a daily basis?  The same Paul Krugman quote in the editorial section every day MONTHS after the Baltimore riots actually took place?  Oh, I can keep my old subscription rate until April?

Kindle_Store,B000HA4FKY,1.0,negative,"For a first-class newspaper to produce something this pathetic is a disgrace.  (Not to mention that, from time to time, it's delivered late).  The formatting is essentially non-existent.  Headlines are repeated (e.g.  one might look like ""Man Bites DogMan Bites Dog""; items are in the wrong sections (e.g. ""Local man wins lottery"" is in the Obituary section); words are broken up; hyphenation is messed up; items in the business section are prefaced with the words ""MARKET MOVERS CHARTS ARE SCALED SO PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS COMPARABLE"" (their capitalization) when there are no charts, of course.

The ""New England in brief"" section is a collection of small stories that the printed edition shows in a narrow column with labels for each item, but the Kindle version just runs them all together with no formatting to distinguish one item from the next.

In summary, it's doubtful there is any review made by a human being.  They just feed the newspaper into one end and some sort of text vaguely related to the original content comes out the other.  Considering that their Globe Reader edition, delivered via Adobe Air, is beautifully done, this product is a disgrace.",193,116

Randomly, with no warning, several weeks ago the Globe became unavailable for reading on Kindle Reader Apps; only on actual Kindle devices themselves.

When attempting to inform the Globe about this change, I couldn't figure out the right avenue.  I ultimately decided on the 'delivery' customer service page only to find the customer service form doesn't work.

So now I have no idea if this was a calculated move on the Globe's part or if this is just an oversight they continue to overlook.  Regardless, random feature changes are a great way to piss off your customers, and I'm now one pissed-off customer.",155,119

But the Globe for Kindle will now jump to $14.99/month. A 50% price increase for *anything* is customer-unfriendly, but especially for the Globe Kindle version: on the Kindle, you do not get certain content such as comics, classifieds, or even the majority of photos in the paper. It is extremely unwise for the Globe to effect this sort of price hike without beefing up the Kindle content for the newspaper -- at the very least, the comics, which most people enjoy reading daily. Because of the new disparity between price and content, I will be canceling my subscription when my 6-month grace period under the old price expires. It is unfortunate, and I will miss receiving it on the Kindle; but the cost-benefit analysis does not pan out with a 50% price hike for the same pared-down content.",187,127

I used to read my daily paper at the kitchen table with my breakfast, and often it was hardly read because of time constraints. Now I begin it at breakfast, but find myself picking it up again and again during the day. Its portability is a big plus. Another big plus is the cost difference. I am saving $30/month over the home delivery method, money I can spend on buying Kindle books. Also there is no recycling of the Kindle edition of the Globe.

I do miss the G section and its tv listings. I also miss the weather reports. The pictures are disappointing: too small and unclear to be of any use.

I'm a daily reader of the Globe's website (amazon won't let me say what that website is) and had never subscribed to the Globe before -- I just wouldn't read the physical paper enough to justify all the recycling, ink-stained hands and high subscription cost.

Now, the kindle version is what it is. I can get most of the Globe daily, whenever and wherever I want to read it in a nice, clean, portable form. It is NOT the entire paper. You get no comics, crosswords, classifieds, or even baseball box scores. But then, the kindle subscription price is less than half the price of even the 50% discounted Globe delivery rate, and it doesn't have ads. Looking at it that way, I think it's well priced at $9.99/month.

Other info: A number of stories, usually front-page ones, have photos. I like that each story tells you the number of words at the start so you know what you're getting into. You can quickly browse sections and stories by going to ""view section list"" and then selecting the number (of articles) in parentheses after the section you want.

So, if you enjoy reading Globe articles away from your computer but can't justify buying the physical paper regularly, this is probably the version for you.",259,134

That being said, I decided to try the Kindle edition for the two week trial, largely to get some local news coverage.  (The Boston Herald, a slightly more conservative competitor isn't available for the Kindle.)
The Globe's Kindle edition was decent.  I still hate the slant of the paper, but having local news was convenient.
But, bias aside, it would be MUCH better if it includes small ""blurbs"" for all of the articles, not merely some.  Approximately 60% of the stories are only listed by their headlines.  Often it was impossible to know what the article was about, and I found myself having to open an article, and often reverse my path if I didn't want to read it.  More details in the article listings would have helped.
In sum, if you like the NYTimes little Bostonian brother for news, the Globe's Kindle edition is ok.  But, if you don't need local news, there really isn't much reason to subscribe.
Give the trial a shot, though.  No harm to try.  (I did cancel before my 14 days ended, as I didn't want to pay for the paper.)",213,144

Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,"This book was one heck of a thrill ride. ""Hitchhiker"" is extremely well written, dark, and twisted. It has an intriguing concept: the main character is a serial killer, who runs into another sadistic psycho that has a partner. I don't want to admit it, but I actually started feeling sorry for the guy! I think it was very clever for the author to show a serial killer who is a bit frightened, disoriented, and even panicked. Obviously, there is no character to root for in ""Hitchhiker,"" since all main characters are evil, but I still rooted for David because he has to fight for his life alone.

""Hitchhiker"" is a fun, exciting book. I did not want it to end! I have never hitchhiked and after reading this book, I will not even try. I will also think twice before trusting a sheriff's deputy!

If you are into crazy serial killers and enjoy battles of wits, then this is the book for you. It will definitely give you chills. The ending is a cliffhanger, which probably means we will meet these insane murderous guys again.",186,1
Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,"I was looking for a horror book by an author that I haven't read before. Tim Kizer is a new name and ""Hitchhiker"" must be his first offering on Amazon kindle. I am glad I bought this book.

I thought ""Hitchhiker"" was disturbing and very entertaining. It was a fast paced, gripping, easy read. Even though I am usually able to predict twists in horror/suspense books, ""Hitchhiker"" caught me off guard. The author knows how to pull the rug from under his readers' feet. I especially liked the trick with state quarters that Tim Kizer used to reveal who the second serial killer was.

My only complaint is that there is no sequel yet, which would tell us what happens to these serial killers afterwards. The book has three serial killers: a loner and a team of two twisted psychos, who battle each other. There is a lot that can happen between them after the events depicted in this book! I'm hoping the author will write a sequel. I'm a fan!

Also, there is a very interesting bonus story ""Intoxication"", which is more subtle, but riveting nonetheless.

Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,1.0,negative,"The premise of the main story in the book, two killers meeting, one a hitchhiker and the other giving him a ride, was not new. It was done (and really well) in 2010- before this book was published- in the story Serial by Jack Kilborn/J.A Knorath and Blake Crouch but since I found the premise interesting I figured I'd read another authors take on the same thing.  I really did not like it at all and I'll just describe the big reasons why.
First, in addition to not being an original idea for the premise, the author for some reason added the Laci and Scott Peterson case into the story. He used different names and such but it was detail for detail that case. Made me wonder if anything about the book was the authors own original thought or idea.
Second was dialog. It was bad. As if the author were struggling to keep true to proper English. But that failed because no one always says ""I am"" rather than I'm or we are instead of we're just as 2 examples. It felt and read disjointed and un natural.
Third is it never made the two main characters seem at all like the big bad guys they were supposed to be. I realize there is not a lot of room in a short story for character development but there should at least be some. The author basically has to tell the reader these are big bad killer guys, which kind of defeats the purpose. They were 2 dimensional and flat.
The same problems came up on a much smaller scale with the second story which was ok. I did not read beyond that. I wanted to like this story but just two many issues with it to work around.",299,12

Kindle_Store,B004R9QIEW,5.0,positive,"This is a book that contains two short horror stories and several sample chapters from a horror novel. I am only mentioning this because it's not really clear from the preview of the book.

A hitchhiking killer flags a car and catches a ride with, well, another killer. No really a spoiler anymore - I saw something about it in the reviews so, I suspected this would happen. Still, the original twist aside, this is just like Tarantino's earlier works - it's not really about the premise, it's about the tension as the story unfolds. Multiple points of view, switching timelines, pretty much everything is there.

The second story is more subtle and that's, perhaps, why not so many reviewers talk about it. However, I found it more involving than the first one. Leslie's character is better developed than the characters in the ""Hitchhiker"" and her doubts about her sanity keep propping the story forward. An attentive reader will notice the influence of the genre classics in this story as well; however, it doesn't really make it predictable.

The book would benefit from a real table of contents and a more detailed upfront explanation of what's included. However, that's an easy thing to fix.

Both stories make for a good reading. Even though they are somewhat mismatched in their premise, the execution with multiple twists and revelations does demonstrate this promising author's style rather effectively. Good read for suspense thriller / horror fans.",243,18

It's about when one serial killer meets another, and what can happen when they're both itching to kill. It's such a cool idea, and the author, Tim Kizer is very creative. He put his own spin on something that was done hundreds of times. He made his own niche, and it works!

Not only is the idea great, but Kizer really captures the readers with his colorful word choices, but he also keeps the excitement, and entertainment throughout the whole story. I was hooked from beginning to finish.

Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,5.0,positive,"I know I put 5 stars, but a little venting first...

I am an avid Terry Pratchett fan.  Bordering on obsessive.  And I am peeved that Paul Kater would dare suggest that his story is based in DiscWorld.  He mentions three witches from Terry Pratchett's world involved in this story and that is absolutely absurd.  In Kater's world, ""Suck an elf"" is a common expression and in Pratchett's world you don't even say the word Elf if you are magical and sucking them would be deadly.  Being in the presence of an elf is deadly.  In Kater's world there are socerers and in Pratchett's world that is not allowed.  It is also deadly.  Same with dragons.  In Pratchett's world, the big ones do not exist (basically... Pratchett fans would understand).  Only little ones the size of dogs.  This in not by far the only mistakes.  The two worlds are completely different and Kater made a tremendous mistake here.

That being said, this book is the only one of eight (eight so far) that even tried this.  So I guess I will cut him some slack because I did love the stories.  They are not well written, I will agree, but the story is great.  If you have any imagination, you can easily forgive the 'unprofessional' writing and enjoy the story.  Many people expect too much from Kindle free books.  This is a venue for amature writers to get their stories published.  They don't have editors and teams of people working behind them.  The stories are pure and unedited, that's what makes them great.  This story is from his mind and no one elses and it is a good one.

Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,"A very entertaining read.  It would have been apt for older children who've known of the classic Snow White, but with the not too subtle sexual scenes, it's R18 at best.

It must really be the author's writing style, but I really find myself frowning at a lot of redundancies - example: ""Snow White had eaten and drunk from the food and drink on the table...""  Really, what else would one do with food and drink???  Another thing, and I might have probably missed it - did the queen get to realize that Snow White was the bride?  Or is the answer in the third  book in the series?

Oh well, as I mentioned, it was very entertaining, I really enjoyed it.",122,18
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,3.0,neutral,"This book was entertaining for a casual novel. The main character was well written and had an attitude that amused me. The plot stayed true to the original story with details that spiced up the open spaces. Do keep in mind that there are mentions of inappropriate behavior, even if it is never described graphically.
However I found the editing to be poorly done; there were several spelling errors, missing words, and poor transitions between scenes. I don't believe that whoever wrote/ edited this really cared about ""quality work"" rather just getting the book finished.",95,19
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,"I downloaded this because a), I'm broke, b) I love fairytales and c) I have yet to meet an updated fairytale that I couldn't love at least partially.... Until now.

This work is absolutely packed with typos, terrible syntax, and inane dialogue... particularly excruciating is the habit the legendary Baba Yaga has of calling the main character ""girlfriend"", and vice-versa.  Like so many other characters, the main purpose of Baba Yaga seems to be to tell Hilda how cool and superior she is, giving the whole thing the feel of an amateur fan fiction that someone mistook for an
original work and published.

I was also infuriated when the author introduced three Terry Pratchett characters (Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, and Magrat Garlick).  I tried to believe that maybe this was a crossover, but when the three highly distinctive characters behaved in opposition to their established modes of behavior and the payoff was, once again, one of them (Magrat) telling in excruciating detail, and with the kind of over-explaining quality exhibited by fifth graders in a creative writing class, how cool and superior Hilda is, while also conveniently identifying Hilda's favorite characteristics.

Pair these faults with other, deliberate features that make my head throb, (see repeated references to the ""mean queen"", awkward inside jokes like King Louie, who wrote a book about the jungle, the removal of power from traditional characters to give to Hilda,  and the over-sexualization of Snow White within the frame work of the original story, in which she is a child,) and you are left with a vaguely plagaristic, self-aggrandizing, pointless piece of schlock that belongs on a fanfiction site, not amazon.",275,20

There are tons of errors and bad sentence structure abounds. The plot is pretty lame, and the author tries in vain to tie it to the original fairy tale but fails miserably.  I also thought the drunken orgy between Snow White and all 7 of the dwarves was in bad taste.  This book is just lame.  I didn't much care for the first one either, but I'm a sucker for free books.  Now I can see why it was free.",109,21
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,"I love Hilda. She is my new hero. Hilda is the type of wicked witch who has her own agenda and follows it. She is not horribly wicked. I found her to be more ""fun"" wicked. It is an amusing book that answers the question, ""why did 7 strangers let a woman they never met stay on in their house?"" The answer, of course, is they were horny little men and Snow White wasn't so innocent. I know the editing wasn't always great but look past that. It really was an entertaining read.",93,22
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,"I don't think that I'm too far off the mark when I say this is a cheap knockoff of Terry Pratchett.  The early chapters of the book read like a piece of Discworld fan fiction, and the author appropriates, by name, three of Pratchett's characters in one scene.

And I think that Kater's writing has more in common with fanfic than any other genre.  It's highly derivative, and the writing is stilted and choppy.  The writer also resorts to fanfic trick of making previously known characters more profane or promiscuous (as opposed to some creative twist on them).  Finally, the text does not appear to have undergone even the most rudimentary editing, which means there are abrupt shifts in tense, misspellings, and grammatical errors galore.

Sure, it's a free download, but you'll still have to spend time reading the thing.  You'd be much better served by picking up the real thing, in the form of a novel by Terry Pratchett (say ""Wyrd Sisters"" or ""Reaper Man"") or Tom Holt (""Snow White and the Seven Samurai"").",175,23
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,2.0,negative,"The idea for this book is wonderful!  Sadly, the results do not live up to the promise.  The grammar is atrocious, the tense ridiculously inconsistent, the humor heavy-handed, and the editing severely lacking.  Someday, Paul Kater may well be an excellent writer--certainly he has the creativity.  He just lacks the skill.  I felt like I was reading a novel written by a twelve-year-old with a dirty mind.",67,24
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,4.0,positive,"Well, she's back! This is one of the most likeable witches to be sooo mean. She reminds me of Alexis from Dynasty.

I cannot wait for further adventures of Hilda. The stories are captivating and fun. I like that she is not excessively cruel- but just to the edge.

In this book she comes to the aide of Snow White simply because she does not like the wicked step-mother.

She has a talking house with an attitude. A taste for unusual sleepwear and a twisted sense of humor.

I do recommend this book to anyone that likes to read ""a good story with fun characters.
I believe that Mr. Paul Kater has stumbled upon the right combination of storytelling and writing skills. I know that I want to see more of Hilda.",132,25
Kindle_Store,B00551DEM0,1.0,negative,"This book seemed as though it would a fairy tale written from another point of view, similar to the books written by Gregory Maguire.  Not even close. It became quickly apparent that the author was not a native English speaker or the work had been poorly translated. That was the first distraction.  The second, and fatal, distraction was a lack of development in both characters and plot lines.  Hilda has jarring quirks of language ('shiny'; 'cool puppies') that, while commented on by other characters, is never brought to fruition or given an explanation.  Snow White turns out not to be so snow white after all but no discussion of why or how this came to be is ever bantered about.  Other sub-plots are also left undeveloped; who are the broom sellers and why exactly are they so intent on exacting revenge on Hilda who, in time-honored wicked witch fashion, merely did not want to buy a broom?  The witches annual meeting on Scary Mountain (a name brimming with lack of imagination) seems so important but why?  What is causing the undercurrent of suspicion and dislike among the witches?  Who are these witches and what do they bring to the tale? And why oh why is Rumplestiltskin there? Why is the house fixated on being painted? The dwarves are unhappy with one another, the king is a milquetoast, the wicked stepmother is a bumbler but never do we learn any more other than these surface details.  There is never a reason to feel invested in any of the characters and therefore, the story itself.

One dimensional characters, subplots with no context, and a strained use of language made for a disappointment from what promised to be, and could have been, a fun and thought provoking twist on an old fairy tale.",300,26

We all know that Mary's ""perspective"" was a bit off-kilter, but one can certainly understand why - and how - she got that way given that she experienced SUCH great loss (and so many times) over such a relatively short period of time.

She has been historically portrayed (possibly somewhat earned) as a complete fool, which now, after reading this book, seems richly undeserved. Frankly, I'm not sure very many of us would be able to withstand the very bright light of such public exposure to which she was subjected both before and after Mr. Lincoln's presidency and murder.

The dialogue was modern and American rather than old fashioned and Scottish.  The grammar had many issues - parallel structure, improper word choice, punctuation, and tense.  The book lacked consistency in its setting.  It was impossible to tell what period of time the book was set in.  There were references which made the setting seem to be in one period - recent fighting with England, but then this is contradicted by references to whalebone corsets, bonbons, and hot house flowers - I have trouble imagining a small Scottish village having a hot house, fine gown maker, and fine jeweler in a time when Scotland had recently been embroiled in English battles.  Additionally, the tanist's former mistress portrayed in the book was not typical of the place described - a rich man's whore described as wearing fine jewelry in excessive amounts and having a fair amount of control in the laird's castle. She sounded more like a woman from regency England.  The plot was okay, but had many cliches.  Even free this book is not worth your time or money.",220,4

Those kilts definitely made for easy access for some of the book's racier moments (and there were several of those). Lachlan and Muira seem very well matched.

the territory of self-published books), the presentation was quite
professional and easy to read. The story itself was delightful. Although
some of the twists and turns (ex: A forced marriage) are common in romance
novel plots, the well-drawn characters made it seem fresh and fun.

There are a LOT of love scenes in this book. I wasn't expecting it to be

This is a beautiful story.  Mesmerizing, even.  It's got everything that a wonderful historical romance should have:  a beautiful, strong-willed heroine, a strong, powerful hero, conflict, tragedy, triumph and finally a love so true that nothing can get in its way.  What more can you want.

The most important basic topics on gardening such as locations and preparation are in here as well as starting points for some useful information on companion planting, container gardening, hanging gardens, and growing and preserving herbs. I found the section on ""Choosing Plants to Attract Birds and Butterflies"" especially helpful since that is something I am just beginning to do in my own garden. The ""Companion Plants to Repel Bugs"" has several ideas I'm going to be trying as well.

Overall this book is especially well laid out for those relatively new to gardening, but even an old hand such as myself can find new and useful information to add to my gardening enjoyment. For in-depth coverage of specific gardening or problem solving topics, you would still need to seek additional information sources, but this book is a good resource to have on hand to get you started and for future reference.

I love this author.  She writes a good story, no heavy sex scenes but you don't really miss them as the story progresses well without it.  This one is taking place in New Orleans and the bayous in the area. Lots of historical facts thrown in from time to time that just add to the story. Little brother gets his friend to agree to a fake engagement to get his big brother off his back.  However, big brother is smarter than he thinks and in discovering the real facts, he falls for the girl.  I could not put this story down.  I spent all day reading it because I knew something great was going to happen soon and it did.  I highly recommend this book and probably all the rest of her books.

There is no mention of the use of cell phones or email.  The entertainment system of the wealthy male lead is mentioned as consisting of records (no mention of the presence or lack there of, of CDs).  I wouldn't have minded the lack of current tech since that has no reflection on the story, but the sexual attitudes of the 80s seems present - it was just a little too constrained in the physicality between the male and female leads.

To end on a positive note.  Great description of the environment, the female lead almost always struck me as smart (okay with the exception of the timing of her escape) and outspoken.  I would definitely look for other books by this author to give her another try.",149,3

Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,1.0,negative,"I rarely review books, especially free ones, and a romance novel I grab for $0 comes with varying expectations.  What I NEVER expect is a MODERN story where the ""heroine"" is abducted - her words - and sexually assaulted by our ""hero"" - seriously, he bruises her when she struggles to get away, forces himself on her despite her clear refusal of his advancements... things like ""please, no.""

I'll give you the occasional passionate bodice-ripper where there are sparks between characters but they learn more about each other, come to understand that they have more in common than they thought, blah blah blah... that I will read with nary a comment about no-means-no and rape culture.  Here we have only the female protagonist's point of view.  And her point of view is that she's afraid, angry, and on the verge of tears for the majority of the book.  The protagonist even goes so far as to tell her that NO ONE WILL BELIEVE HER when she threatens to report him for kidnapping.  Excuse me while I swoon.

We never hear any reason for her to ""fall in love"" with this man.  All I read was evidence for kidnapping, sexual assault, and battery.

Spoiler alert: they end up living happily ever after.  HOW?!",212,5

Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,2.0,negative,"Even given the time this book was written, i just don't get how it is romance....the 'hero' kidnaps, tries to intimidate, and control the heroine.  He never professes or shows any real love for her.  That he wants her, yes.  He even deceives her as to the meaning of a tradition he convinces her to be part of, that it is only a game. But he, in turn, takes this tradition as having real consequences he intends to hold her to without her knowledge. How is that 'love' by any stretch of the imagination?  His actions show a desire to control her, not love for her.

This book would send a counselor at an abused womens' shelter into seizures.

That being said, I do like the author's writting style but I need to question the judgement shown in her storyline.",140,9

Kindle_Store,B009QMIMMG,1.0,negative,"A very disappointing ""romance.""  Surprisingly, there is no sex other than kissing.  The heroine Sherry is incredibly naive, to the point of appearing pretty stupid.  It was impossible for me to understand how she fell in love with Lucien after he kidnappped her and treated her with extreme harshness and disrespect.  Also, the Kindle version had some completely unexplained ""typos"" in it.  For instance, a boat is ""fled"" to the dock when I think the author meant ""tied"" to the dock.  This isn't even a malapropism, it's just very poor proofreading that makes it difficult for a reader to figure out what is meant.

At the end of the book are synopses of some of Jennifer Blake's other books and, hmmmm, sounds like they're all pretty similar in tone, and even plot.  No more for me, thank you very much.",140,11

It became in my thinking a most beautiful place. However, the sentences went against every writing rule I have studied. There was too much use of ""be"" verbs (had, has been, was, were). There were also telling verbs such as ""felt"" and ""begun to"" throughout the book. The over-abundance of these really hurt the story tremendously. The plot itself was a bit vague. I was confused at times by the language as to exactly what Sherry or Lucien were saying to each other, especially in some of her personal thoughts. The romance itself was very clean, which I appreciated. There wasn't as strong of an attraction between the characters as I like, but this was, again, probably because of the poor sentence structure.

In addition, it is virtually impossible to guess the word without asking for a ""clue""- which ends up being a letter and defeats the whole spirit of the game.

It's not that it doesn't load anything, it's the setup that is horrible. You choose to play, choose a category and difficulty, and start the game.

It has to refresh the screen every time i hit wrong because the hanged man is too large to just refresh on its own. I thought it was going to be simple and fun like every word or the grid. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone who has the ability to see the kindle screen. But if you want a hangman game that will torture your eyes and the kindle screen go ahead and waste a dollar.,95,121

Also, I think when you get the word correct the word should appear written correctly before the word completely disappears and the game tells you it is right. This makes it seem kind of cut rate, to me.  Thirdly, the letters do not always ""clear"" when you press them.  Sometimes you have to press a letter several times for it to register.  At times I have had the same word come up with only one word between.  And lastly, it would help to have the used incorrect letters showing along the side of the picture.",109,126

There are  2  major problems. 1) when you finally solve the word puzzle and put in the last letter, it doesn't show you the word. It immediately says you won but you don't get to see the word. It is especially a pain if the last 2 letters in the word are the same, it will catch you by surprise as it blocks you from seeing it and now you don't know what the word was. 2) it repeats the same words too frequently. I played this for less than 15 minutes and it was already repeating the same words in the category. Pathetic! You are better off throwing your $1 purchase in the toilet.

Five levels of difficulty, six categories of words (animals, common words, food, human body, office and business; transport and vehicle). I took one star off because it goes through only eight steps of execution (two for the gallows and six for the hanged) , and I would sadistically prefer a slower process, maybe ten or eleven steps. I also would like a better and more humorous image of the hanged unfortunate one. But it is all minor in comparison with the joy of feeling yourself a child again, this time playing it hi-tech style with your own kids.
Edited later: (some reviewers correctly pointed out that when you got the word correctly, the game does not give you a feeling of satisfaction by showing a completed word, instead, you immediately see a half screen that covers the word and a question whether you want to play again. It is idiotic on the part of the software creators and they should fix the problem ASAP. Actually I have to take another star for this reason, but I will keep four for mentioned above nostalgic feelings).",203,236

The little man is unimaginative and looks the same every time. The words that you guess are divided in to easy - hard levels and into categories- animals, transportation, etc. There is very little difference between the levels and the categories are very broad. For example, the animals category uses every obscure dinosaur name. It kind of takes the fun away when the word in question isn't really something you recognize even if you happen to guess it. Additionally, when you do get the word correct the screen flashes to a box that reads,"" would you like to play again?"". You never get to read the finished word, the box pops up as you guess the last correct letter. This simple game could be lots more fun and better thought through. Try again, Jared!",160,259

It would be better if you saw the right answer where the blanks were.

No cohesiveness of thought or deductions. Character names just appeared without information as to how they related to the story at that point.

Jake played the part of a partner pretty well. Between the two of them, they were a formidable team. I will read more of 'The Davenport Mysteries'.",83,49
Kindle_Store,B00B30IW4W,3.0,neutral,This book written in a steady pace and the plot involves corporate cover ups and kidnapping. The two main characters slowly develop as the story goes along. My only problem was that a character's internal dialogue was written in quotations alongside their conversations with another person. This hinders the flow of reading because the reader has to separate a character's thought from what they are saying aloud to make sense of what is going on by way of interaction. It would be better to write the internal thoughts in italics and the spoken words in quotations.,96,50

english obviously is not the first language of this author.  however, i have read indian writers before and their use of english is impeccable if more based on british english and indian english.  in any case it is understandable and in its own context, i.e. the story is set in india.  this author obviously did not do any research on the fbi, its procedures, protocols and personnel policies, not to mention little if any research about the united states and americans.

Dialogs are terrible. Characters are extremely unlikeable and they don't act or talk like real people do. There are extremely cheesy and cliche lines which will make you roll your eyes.

Grammar doesn't make sense most of the time. It reads like the book is a poor google translate rather than an original work. Besides the terrible grammar mistakes, the formatting is also very poor.

But one day out of know where she meets Jed Jones, a man who has a document stating that half of her land is his, and that they must get married by Midnight if they wish to keep their land.

Carrie doesn't trust this at all, even though the document seemed real and the judge and sheriff approved it. She still doesn't believe it. And Jed said they would only be married by name, so they have to make it look real to others but they each know it isn't. She tries everything she can to prove that Jed isn't who he says, and that everything he's said about her family is lies.

Jed on the other hand is instantly attracted to Carrie, and wants to make her his wife in every way possible. He will stop at nothing to win her over, and make her love him.

But people around them want to take the land away from them, so they have a lot of things to go through before they can live happily ever after.

This book was okay. I got extremely frustrated with Carrie throughout the whole book. The way she wouldn't ever believe anything that Jed said was truly annoying. And the fact that she kept saying she was going to end the marriage, but yet didn't actually do a whole lot to end it at all. I truly couldn't stand her at all, and it made me dislike the book.

Along comes a handsome stranger that says his grandfather was a partner in the ranch and his will states they must marry or lose the land.

She is going to think about it.  She only has a few hours!  WHAT is there to think about.  She is about to lose everything.  The story could have been a good one but I lost interest in the dialogue.  They all sound like old dumb west.  I think the characters could have been a bit brighter.

Carrie agrees to marry the dazzlingly handsome stranger Jed in order to comply with a will supposedly written by their grandfathers. She goes through with the ceremony on the advice of the judge and with the promise from Jed that it will be in name only. She fully intends to get an annulment, despite the fact that Jed tells her it is forever.
He has earned money working hard on the trail and wants to invest and enjoy his own land. She has nothing but debts at the store, so that at least seems like a good idea...for now. Jed has promised that he will not force her, but he has every intention of courting her and winning her around, especially as there is an undeniable attraction between them.
There is a mystery surrounding the death of their fathers and some scandal in the family, which is investigated as the story progresses, questioning the past, the will and ownership of the ranch. Jed also has a wealthy grandmother who desperately wants him to come home and will do anything to scupper his ranch plans.

The real story is of course the romance between Carrie and Jed. He is charming, generous, kind and thoughtful, with beautiful manners unlike the cowboys she has grown up with. She can see all of his qualities, but hates the idea that she is cornered against her will. Jed is happy to have Carrie as his wife, despite the doubts about the past. She is pretty, capable and intelligent. Inevitably she falls for him as much as he falls for her.

Therefore, her grandfather's will stated that if she and Jed were not married by a certain date, the ranch would be given to an orphanage.  That ""certain date"" is today so they must marry before midnight or forfeit the ranch.

Carrie had been unaware of the terms of the will until Jed showed up and told her they had to marry TODAY.  For some reason Carrie blamed Jed for the fact that the two of them had to marry even though he was just the messenger.  He was no more to blame for the terms of the will than she was so I lost all patience with her because she spent so much time being hostile toward him.  I couldn't understand why that hostility could not be directed toward the person who set the terms of the will...her grandfather.

It's not listed as Christian fiction but the author is at goodchristiancowgirl dot com, and that's fine.  Just wish I'd of known as it would have stopped even the teensy bit of suspense I felt.

Mostly, I finished it feeling annoyed by the one sentence in the book that wasn't charitable, forgiving and sweet - that the ""soiled doves"" exorbitant prices used up all the cowhands money!!! And, gasp, how a cowboy could come speak with a decent woman straight from one - even though he'd bathed, of course)

I imagine ""soiled doves"" got very very little of those exorbitant monies, and certainly deserved every penny up til their early death.

I did enjoy the scenery descriptions and the falling in love obstacles, but if I heard the term Mr/Ms. Jones one more time....well I did over and over and over right up to the end of the book. But the relationship between the lead characters was lovely - if only real life were that good!  And the writer was good at descriptions of place and characterizations; it was nice to read a book where the characters - unlike vampire novels, which I mainly read, smile - were all good souls.

A note on soiled doves, from the excellent website soiled-doves dot com:  ""For their efforts, like other pioneers of that time, they risked disease, injury and in some cases death.""  The site is worth a look just for it's amazing historical research presented.",284,16

However I got into this one very easily. I recommend this book to readers who want excitement. It does have an abrupt ending as to you wanted to know what happens next.",125,26

That being said, I have gone back and bought other titles to support a good author.  They do a leap of faith to offer the book, I reward that risk.  But to end a story in mid-thought feels like coercion and I won't go for it.

Sorry, Scott, I don't waste my time on previews and this was even worse because it wasn't labeled as such.  I do like series but this isn't fair and I feel so wronged that I don't care what happened.",105,27

Someone should be very embarrassed for allowing this ""book"" out in the public when it should not even be published as a high school project.  The story line is almost as weak as the writing.

Apart from the choppy story telling, grammatical errors with verb tense and phraseology make parts of the story a distraction from just trying to figure out what sentences were supposed to have been. Too many plot possibilities with little or no resolution make this piece painful.

Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,So much going on yet I can't put the kindle down! I love this so far and can't wait to read more,22,129

Be prepared for a cliff-hanger!

I give it 3.5 stars!",116,130
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,This was a great read! Anymore freebies? Please keep them coming! Better than Janet Evanovich last book! Keep up the excellent work!!!!,22,131
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"I enjoyed the book, but would not recommend it  The story is not finished. The author just stopped writing  I looked for book 2 not found and no promise of more",31,132
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,Good job. I love the twists and turns and hope there is another so I can continue reading and see what happens,22,133
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,"OMG AV talk about a page turner, I couldn't put it down. One of the best reads I have had in a long time. Thanks for the ""cliffhanger"" ending (NOT) ! I can not wait until High Heels and Lip Gloss is released,  I really need to find out what happens with Melissa.",53,134
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,great I always love the books I get for my kindle.  Love the way it becomes instant. Hope to get a kindle for my grand son,26,135
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"I toughed it out through the whole book even though 75% of it made no sense (despite the disclaimer at the beginning saying the book had been re-edited and ""fixed"" in 2012). The only thought when I got to the last page was ""Wait, what?"" And not in a good way.
The story line(s) in this book are just so random and it's like the author forgot what she was writing about and didn't connect the dots.
I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they wanted to kill a few hours reading a bunch of mini-stories that don't really go anywhere or go together.",105,136
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,"I love this book because it grab and held my attention from page one. Plus it was filled with alot of twisted and turns. I recommend this book to all readers and bookclubs. A.V Scott did an excellent job. This is a must read, you will not be disappointed.",49,137
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"Maybe entertaining to start with...but even from the start it was so painfully cliche and felt like it was trying to emanate ""sex and the city"" but didn't get there...As I read further, I realized the storyline jumped about, made no sense (one moment she is going to London, next chapter it was meant to be Paris) she's happily running around after 2 days in hospital from unexpected life saving surgery for her cancer, is pregnant and doesn't drink but next page she is out getting wasted on cocktails, and somehow every character turns out to secretly be some other character's sister, mother, lover etc. Not only is it not remotely believable, but its also hard to follow the storyline- less drama and more focus would of maybe made a more readable book! I wasn't even bothered by the unfinished ending...just happy that the book was over! Oh, and it still needs lots of editing and typo corrections!",158,138
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,"Okay i thought this story had a great premise and the two main characters sounded interesting but then it started to get seriously insulting.  The plot is trying way too hard to go in twenty directions, nothing is resolved.  Spoiler alert ! For instance what happened to the pregnancy?  And then cancer?  Really should we just throw things and see what sticks?  And that is just one character!  Very dissappointing.",70,139
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"I downloaded this boom because it was free. After only 9 pages into it, I realized its a rip off of Gemma Holliday's 'High Heels Mysteries.'  So far same plot and same type if character, down to Melissa's job.",39,140
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,"I CHOOSE THE rating because the story line had more twist than a fun park. Ride. I DIDN'T like how the book just leave a reader hanging, I not sure if this is because it's on line .Might recommend this book to a friend.",44,141
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,Crazy story line that was very poorly written. I was relieved when it ended. Calling it chick lit with anything is a true disgrace to real chick lit.,28,142
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,"but what is book 2!!!????? really leaves you hanging... but it was a good story, it was really easy, and i wish it would have stuck to a few less BIG advents... it seems like way to much is happening. but I will read the next one once i find out what it is.",54,143
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,"Fun, very easy read. Wondering if I'll pay the money for book 2- wondering what's gonna happen to all the girls that's for sure! Good/bad cliff hanger lol",28,144
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"Great concept for a story but too much jumping around , dropping situations and way too rushed. Maybe slow down and focus on a storyline and not jump between 5",30,145
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"So many times I get the free books, and many times the cover looks promising as this one did. However, aside from the usual typos and misspellings this book skipped entire key parts of its supposed storyline. It also never came to any conclusions. Character development was disappointing as well. Sorry, A.V. Scott, I won't be reading further.",58,146
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"Many typos, scattered story line, and no ending.

This could have been a decent story had there been character development and a conclusion to the plot.",26,147
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,"Good
But what happened  what is the next book.  Who did it should not  end a book that way.  Mjunc2345@aol",20,148
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,"Ok so a good read those of u who know me know that I need an ending even in a series so the down fall is a cliff hanger which was great but didn't leave me rushing to buy part two
To be 100% honest I accidentally clicked on buying this book yep I paid for it and I always read free unless series captivates me so I guess that was stoke one two was the non ending glad there wasn't a three I will try and read the next oneday",91,149
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,Keeps you paging. Ends too soon.  It leaves you with just enough to want to know more? Waiting to see who did it,23,150
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,"I was very impressed by the amount of drama, mystery and intrigue this book had!  I about died when it ended as it did and can't wait for book two!  Keep'em coming Ms. Scott!",34,151
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,5.0,positive,"I really liked this book. It's a quick, easy, enjoyable read. I thought the characters were very likeable and I couldn't put it down. I had to know what was going to happen next! My only real complaint is that it ended right on a cliffhanger and now I'm forced to wait for the next one before I can find out what happens!",63,152
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,3.0,neutral,It was pretty good but the ending should have been different.  One part begin to talk about another person that wasn't even a character in the book. That was confusing.,30,153
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,Too many typos coupled with a rushed ending.  I really wanted to like it this book but it just fell flat.,21,154
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,4.0,positive,"The book has a great story to tell.  The author does need to do some editing, a little confusing in some chapters.  I do see however that the author is rewriting to correct some inconsistancies.  Looking forward to rereading!!",39,155
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,"To short feels unfinished wish it went more in depth
Like many more people have said the ending left so much unsaid",22,156
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,1.0,negative,"This book features two shallow friends who wish only fame, fortune, money and recognition.  The original premise is somewhat interesting, if not original:  An unplanned pregnancy discovered as a relationship ends.  The best friend is an aging Hollywood star/diva.  The heroine is self-absorbed, money-seeking female.  The friend is a nympho with commitment issues.  There is some potential, but this book sadly lacks anyone that the reader cares about.  This is a waste of time, and if you buy or bought it, a waste of money.",85,157
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,"The story line is decent but I hate the inconsistancies...first chapter, she is looking at the gown tempted to put it on and next paragraph is removing the gown, the lunch is, in the first part, a monthly meeting but in the next part is a weekly meeting.....very irritating feels as though the author wrote in a hurry and did not check her work, why her publishing group did not catch these errors?????? Not well written.",76,158
Kindle_Store,B00DG7W93K,2.0,negative,"I thought this was going to be a quick, fun and easy read. It was not. There were plenty of changes from past to present tense, some of the characters names changed mysteriously then changed back and some of the storylines were well...underdeveloped. This was a decent draft but needs much more editing for consistency, continuity and character development. Overall though this book's main focus seems to be on the fabulous life of the heroine and her best friend. I mean you're crying b/c you can't wear heels...seriously?
Not very good, wouldn't suggest to anyone.",95,159
