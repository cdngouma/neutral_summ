Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"Great case as far as fit and finish.  Mine came with a slight imperfection on the side but not worth the trouble of exchanging. Seems solid and durable.  Nice soft touch.  Highly recommended, and I am very picky with my cases.",41,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,Had this case for 3 days and the kickback broke DO NOT BUY THIS CASE NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALLLL,21,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"This is a nice and solid iphone case. It fits my iphone 4 perfectly and I really like the kickstand. Only complaint I have is that the kickstand looks metal in the photos, but it is actually made of plastic and feels like it will break easily with much use. The case itself, however, feels sturdy and protects my iphone well.",61,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,I'm very happy with this new case for my iphone 4G.  The product is exactly the same as it is described by the seller.  Very light and beautiful!!! I like it a lot and I will definitely recommend this case to everyone!,42,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,I've tried/ own several different cases since buying my iPhone 4 last year... For the money this one by far is my favorite... It's not ill fitting or heavy. Whether in a belt holster or pants pocket its easy to carry and feels as solid as the phone itself. It looks and feels nice to handle and the built in kickstand is an added bonus for watching videos or using other apps in Landscape mode.,75,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,the case fits great and doesn't add bulk to my pocket. this case also stands on its side so i can use it for you tube videos.,27,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,It def looks a lot better on amazon. Feels and looks kind cheap but for the price what do you expect,21,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,I bought this for my iPhone 4 and it fits perfect on it. It's really nice the change of look and the phone looks very resistent. Thank you very much. Totally recommended.,32,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"The stand just a piece of plastic on a hinge, but it serves its purpose, especially considering the price tag on this item.

The case itself can be hard to snap together (or was for me, at least) so don't plan on using it if you are going to be taking it on and off frequently.

That being said, it's a wonderful, compact case that serves its purpose.",68,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,Awful case. Made of cheap plastic that snapped while I was putting it on. The kickstand is a little piece of plastic that's glued to the back. Don't buy this case! Mine was in the trash in minutes.,38,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,"this case was excellent for the price and was very solid, it did interfere with the screen cover however on the rim.  I felt my phone was safe and protected in this case....",33,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,It's not worth it.  Does not do what it is intended to do.  I would return it but not worth the postage.  They got me.,25,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,"This case was good, but the little kickstand to watch movies on it was really difficult to pop out. I think I broke my nail every time I tried to use it. Not bad for price.",36,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,"This is a decent cover for the price I paid.  The kickstand broke off the second day i had the cover, but you get what you pay for.  Other than that, it protects the phone fine and the charger fits without having to remove it.",45,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,This is a useless product made of cheap plastic. The kick stand never came out and is just a bad product.,21,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,received broken case i won't buy it again looks very cheap product i will get from some where else .,20,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,"Don't wast your money.  This kickstand case only allows yoy one way to stand your phone up which covers the volume.  After 2 days of use, case started pealing this plastic celophane type material.",34,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"Actually the fact that the stand is out of plastic but looks like shiny metal is excellent, I read other reviews of how the metal interferes with reception. I had metal cases too and, while they looked nice, they messed up the voice reception on the phone.. Had it for 6 months now..  beautiful case, compact and sleek with a rim around the screen so the screen is protected. .. It really looks costly and even nicer than some of the very expensive ones out there.. I say buy ... no brainer.. I'm back to buy the white one..",99,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"The case itself is made well, I would say.  I feel my phone is protected well. I love the stand, it works well! I bought it because I constantly watch Netflix on my phone. I am a little afraid every time I stand up my phone that the stand is going to break, but it hasn't yet! The plastic doesn't seem like it can hold the weight of the phone... But i'm not going to doubt it, just yet.",79,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,"The case works fine, looks fine and seems to protect the phone for the most part. But when I took it off to switch cases I found that i scratched my iphone ALOT!!! the whole metal platting around the iphone is sctrached, for this the case gets only 1 star, A case should protect your phone not ruin it!!",59,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,Love the case but cannot charge with a standard iPhone wall charger. It will not fit between the case edges.,20,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,It's nice but... it's cheap plastic. When I first got it I almost pulled off the silver-looking kick stand. It'll work as a case if you need something like that. Just be wary.,33,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,"Overall this was a good case, kickstand feature was incredible and very useful. Although within a few days the coating on the cover began to peel and it looked like I'd had it for years by the time the first week was over. I had to buy a regular non exciting speck case to replace it. I kept the case for plane rides and trips. You cant go wrong for the price, but you get what you pay for.",79,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,"This product never ever came. I was so disappointed because I thought this case was very sharp and professional. As I type...... No case, still",25,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"Nice solid case nice kickstand, just doesnt stay on when you have aux cord in. Fits me perfect, its or maybe i need a skinny aux cord.",27,24
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"This cover is the most practical of covers...protects, is easy to hold onto even for smaller hands, and is posionable for watching or listening.",24,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,2.0,negative,"The item arrived in good condition but after a few days of use the satin coating on the black plastic started to peel off at the edges as I slid the phone in a nd out of my pocket. Now, after just one month this looks like a very old and ruggedly used item, when all it has gotten in gentle handling. This is a very bad product for its coating, although I still like the kickstand feature. If I can find the kickstand feature with a better finished product this one is history. I just wish the coating was a LOT more durable. If you like carrying around an iphone with peeling coating (like a snake shedding its skin) then this product is for you.",126,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"nice case for iphone! especially for the price! only reason i did not rate it a five star is because of the flimsy plastic stand that comes with it. Not the sellers fault, I rate the seller a five. great place to shop and do business with. I highly recommend buying from this seller!",54,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"I'm very please with this case(I have an IPhone 4s). It came just as advertised. Works Great, very sturdy; Love the Kickstand while browsing the web, viewing video/TV. Delivery was just as promised. I put it together easily, and within minutes. I went to the Apple store to find a case, and they were $30.00-$50.00...What? And they were half the case as this. Protect your $300 phone with this sturdy, functional IPhone 4s case.  Love it!~",76,28
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,It's a very bulky case and the stand is not that sturdy. It did interfere with my phone signal so I had to buy a new case after only using it for a day. I wouldn't recommend this case.,39,29
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,2.0,negative,"Bought this case for my nephews new iPhone, and it's a tad bit cheapy looking. I would not buy it.",20,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"Nice product and does exactly as described, protects the phone and allows access to all buttons, speakers, microphone, and cameras. I have the 4GS. The finish is not the best; it appears to be chipping like paint does after only two weeks. So, do not expect it to be pretty, although they did try with the chrome and apple window. The kickstand works, but is apparently delicate.",67,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,Falling apart after a few days... Looks like crap after 1 week!  You get what you pay for.  Keep looking!!!,20,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,"plastic kickstand is tough to open and broke 2nd time used, spend more on a kickstand that is made from a stronger material.  Other then that, the case is fine.",30,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"This case is a solid build with the exception of the kickstand.
I haven't (intentionally or not) dropped my phone but I am confident
that it will protect it from most impact. I paid less than $9 from
Empire Accessories which goes by CNC Imports LLC with Amazon.
For that amount, I feel like I came away with nice product.
It comes with a screen guard as well. I would give it a five
out of five but like most people already pointed out, the kickstand
is flimsy. Handle that with care because the kickstand and the
price was a deal maker for me upon purchase.
-------------------------------------------------
This is a one month update.
It's true about the peeling.
So as long as you know you are getting $9 quality.
But I still stand firm on protection. At least the phone
fits snug and I feel secure that it will resist most falls
on impact.",154,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"Great cover, nice fit, no gaps, good feel. Two piece snap together design protects iPhone 4s without a lot of bulk.",21,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,this case it s awsome it work very well no matter that the stand it s plastic and no metal like i thought before i order and them read the reviews. The only thong i don't give five star is because it result a king of hard to fit to my iphone 4s i though that it going to scrath but its not. It fit very welll and work nice.,70,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,3.0,neutral,"I like the way this case looks.  I like the color contrast; the black with the chrome (color), and the window in the back that highlights the Apple logo.  The case has a soft feel, and fits the iPhone 4 perfectly.  The chrome kickstand is made of plastic, but a nice chrome color.  I wish that mine would have been made of metal, but it serves it's purpose as a kickstand.  I wouldn't rely on the kickstand lasting very long. The case will protect your iPhone, but I'd be afraid if I dropped my phone in this case.  It seems to protect the sides, but the front of the phone is not protected.  Right now I'm using this case on my phone, and I carry this case in a leather pouch that I used for my BlackBerry.  Overall this is a great starter case, and Amazon sells it for a really good price, but I'm buying another case so that my iPhone will be protected all around.",167,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,1.0,negative,"I bought this case during Cyber Monday, so I thought that explained the huge price drop (marked down from $49).  In truth this is just a cheap knock off case that looks good in pictures only.  The construction is flimsy, the ""kickstand"" is a slight breeze away from snapping off and when you put the case on you phone you lose 2 bars of reception.  For $9 bucks it is not worth the effort to return then darn thing, but please DO NOT think you are getting a $49 quality case. This is straight off Canal street junk. Avoid.",99,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,This case was just what I was looking for. It is sleek and professional in appearance. I woul recommend this case.,21,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"At first glance the case is very sharp looking, even feels nice in your hand. Decent fit and finish. 2 piece snap on case that fits well together, no squeaks and keeps phone secure. The chrome look stand and logo hole are plastic and scratch very easily and the stand is super flimsy. I'm very careful with mine and I believe that's the only reason it hasn't snapped off yet. If that piece was better made and the chrome was more durable I'd give it 5 stars.",87,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,4.0,positive,"I bought this case for my sprint iPhone 4s. I spent about two days researching cases and finally settled on this one for two reasons. One it looked good (which it does look great on the phone), and two it looked like it would provide decent protection for not just the back but also the front of the phone with the raised lip on the cover so the screen actually has a bumper. The kickstand was just an added bonus that I thought would be cool on an other whys great looking case. The kickstand does work but when I first got it I thought I was going to break it off. After having it for about 4 days now the kickstand is still intact and I have gotten use to how to carefully use the kickstand when I want it. Overall it's a great case with a great price, while i was at the sprint store they were selling complete garbage not even close to being as nice as this one for 25-35 dollars. I would recommend this case and would by another one even if the kickstand breaks off this one.",193,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"great quality for the any price..It fits well and allows easy operation. also prevents accidental button pushing as well.  I really like it a lot.  do not fret, buy it...rest are way over priced.",34,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055LZ1YE,5.0,positive,"I ordered this case for my new Iphone 4, and I have been completely satisified ever since.  The product is made of sturdy materials, and it has a nice kickstand on the back that is made of chrome.  I have dropped my phone several times since I purchased the case, and it protected my Iphone.  I am completely satisifed with the performance of this phone case.",66,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,I ordered this case with the assumption that it would actually FIT my iPhone 4S by Verizon. Boy was I surprised. When I got it in the mail I took it out of the packaging and tried to put it on my phone and it seemed like it was made for a completely different phone. I was extremely disappointed.,59,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,"doesnt really look nice either...cheap, but at this price, its what you expect...if you dangle the phone a bit while holding the case by just the sides, the phone falls out...but I gave it two stars, because it looks really nice ....when laying on a table...in the dark.",48,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,"this came in pretty decent time and it looks god and fits my iphone 4s good, your getting exactly what you are seeing.",23,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,"It looked so simple and pretty in the picture that when I got it I was highly disappointed. The plastic wasn't molded correctly so it's deformed around the edges, and it doesn't fit the phone snuggly, so when i remove it there's a bunch of random debris and dust trapped in the back. Doesn't protect the phone, too cheap to look pretty. Wouldn't recommend... I've been looking for a new one already.",72,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,This case was great and has protected my phone through many falls! It is sturdy and way more than I expected for such a great price!,26,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,I liked the case a lot. It is cute and handles well. It does feel a little tight around the corners. I'd like it to fit a little better there.,30,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,The case was just okay. It looked cheap when I got it and the sparkles came off all the time.,20,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,"It's ok, I didn't really like the way it fit on my iphone nor the texture of the case .",20,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,"This product took a little while to be delivered because it came from Hong Kong and I am in the US. But it was worth the wait. It's very nice looking (very sparkly) and works very well with the iPhone 4. Extremely cheaper than the ones in any department, drug, or electronic store.",53,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,this pink sparles case was cheaply made it looks better in the picture than it does in person. I did not like this at all,25,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,I got this case to match a pair of sperry's I have and lots of people noticed and complimented me!! I love this case very cute!!! GREAT QUALITY,28,10
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,Cute sparkly iPhone case!  It's worth the price so I wasn't expecting anything designer.  I have a lot of these types of cases so I can change them out whenever I want and not feel bad about spending a lot of money on one case.,45,11
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,It's a cute case but that's really all it has goin for it. It provides no protection for the phone and the glitter did come off rather easily.,28,12
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,You get what you pay for and that is true in this situation too. I used it a few times and then threw it away because it was getting discolored and the coating was peeling off the hard plastic case. Oh we'll.,42,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,Loose at corner and seems cheap.  The color is ok and the sparkles as well.  I expected something a bit stronger.,21,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,i thought the case would be a little more sturdy...its very thin plastic and the glitter falls off everywhere!! but i guess i got what i paid for.,28,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,"This is a super cute case I like it a lot especially if your a girl who loves pink, fits my iPhone 4 perfectly and it's easy to take off",30,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,"This product is really good, and very cute. However, the sparkles/sequins start coming off and leaving little tears in the back of the case. It's really annoying and can get caught on hoodies and such.",35,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,"I think that this phone case is cute. Looks much different in person, but its not bad at all...I am giving this a two star because it smells like chemicals. VERY strong smell to it. Gives me a slight headache. So instead of wasting my time sending it back. I will just re-gift this item.",55,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,The case does not offer any protection for the phone it is purely for looks. When it arrived it smelled weird and sparkles started coming off immediately. I have only had it for a week and it already looks worn and dirty just from being in my purse. Next time I would splurge for a more expensive case for better quality.,61,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,My princess loves her girly cases and this is one of her favorites - will be purchasing more cases like this one.,22,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,"I really love how the pink spark case looks on my iphone 4, but I don't like what the glitter feels like to the touch.",25,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,"It's ok, only because it's a little flimsy.  I paid the same price for a similar one in green, and it actually had a harder outser shell.  Look for something a little studier in case you actually drop your phone hard.",41,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,"Like color has great piazza for the my phone!
Sparkles fall off. Have yellow now and they loose the glitter.

I recommend it though, cute",28,23

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,"Picture doesn't look anything like it does in person. The corners were oddly shaped and turn blue if you put your phone in a jean pocket and also, the sparkles fall off. I gave it 2 stars because when it comes to plain snap on case, I guess it does it's job, but overall look and build is crap.",59,30
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,It is a very pretty case. Has lots of sparkles. Great price and a wonderful way to match your phone with your outfit.,23,31

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,"This phone case was already way to difficult to ""slip on"" and off as it is but to add to the dissatisfaction it fell apart way to quickly. I got another phone case for my wife that was the same price at the same time and she loves it twice as much and actually took this one off immediately! Also it's material is quick to get grimy and gross so it's overall just not a good buy even for the cheap price.",82,33

But it's ok",35,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,This is a very pretty case.  The picture on Amazon actually reflects what it will look like (the color) in person.  It is very shimmery & I get a lot of compliments on it when I use it.  The price is great.  I would recommend this case to others.,49,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,its pretty just really cheap plastic case and does not look like quality. Hey what did i expect for such a cheap price. you get what you pay for.,29,37

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,"I ordered this case for my friend and I thought it was really cute! And it is. When she opened it she was really happy! The only thing is, is that it's scratchy and glitter falls off easily. Also the color of jeans sticks to the sides of the rubber part of the case. If you want a cheap case then I suggest this one it's cute and simple.",69,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,"Nice shiny case, very cheap, fast shipping, and most important, the wife was happy with it. Can't go wrong for 3 bucks. Worth the price.",25,41

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,i hate this case because it doesn't protect the phone at all not even a little and it feels like card board and it doesn't sit even on the phone so it is lopsided. i don't recommend this to anyone!,40,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,You get what you pay for in this case.  It feels like you are holding sand paper.  I kept it on for a few hours and am trying to pawn it off on a teenager who might like it.,39,44

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,2.0,negative,This case took a very long time to arrive and it wasn't exactly like the picture. The case itself looks a little different. It almost looks like glitter was glued onto a regular case,34,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,5.0,positive,"I love this cover. The picture looks different than the actual cover, but that is far from a negative. It is actually a textured case so the glitter does not fall off too easy.",34,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,3.0,neutral,didnt care much for the glitter and it made the phone feel a lot heavier than what it actually is,20,49

Covering the sides just enough so if dropped it would still be protected yet cute. The only negative thing about this case is the sparkles catch things and snag them.

Like the description says the case only covers the back and some of the sides (Keep in mind this is Not a protective case at all). For what I payed for, didn't expect much but when I received it it was good enough. I was looking for something sparkly/glittery, and also got a lot of compliments from my friends. It gets dirty quick because the color is so light and sometimes when I slip it into my jeans pocket the blue denim rubs off onto the edges after some of the sparkles had eventually rubbed off from normal wear and tear. All in all, I was satisfied but decided to order the black sparkle case color at a later time because I liked the case, just not the dinge it got after awhile.",159,55

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,4.0,positive,"Product arrived earlier than expected, and fits its description well. The one thing I that threw me off slightly was its a baby pastel pink (almost white) glitter sparkle instead of the light bubble gum pink sparkle. However, it was a gift for a friend and she LOVES it. When it first came in I was afraid the glitter would get everywhere, however she has had it for a week now and not even a speck of glitter has rubbed off. Very Happy!",83,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0055S1U1K,1.0,negative,"I typically will read the reviews before buying any product so in a way it's my fault. I was blinded by the sparkles, I suppose.  The case actually fits my 4s Sprint phone perfectly fine, but in the pictures it looks like it goes all the way around the phone and covers the front.  Unfortunately it only covers the back, so there is absolutely no protection for the phone.  I won't be able to use it at all, as the only way my phone has survived several falls is because the case has broken and left the phone intact. My phone would be sacrificed if using this case. So, even though it looks like the  case goes all the way around the bottom, there is no bottom, the side is non-existent where the buttons are and the top is also non-existent.  I suggest this seller put a picture that acurately portrays their product. I am not at all happy with this purchase.",162,62

I didn't want a lot of bells and whistles but nothing to plain either.  This handles both worlds.  Easy to understand, feels well made and I like the Blackberry look.  Just starting to see what this phone can do, but I can tell you this...I'm never going back to a contract!",69,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,4.0,positive,"I bought my phone at Target but I still wanted to leave a review. I am sure there are others who use amazon reviews for new products whether they purchase through amazon or not.

I have had this phone for about 2 weeks now and I am pretty happy with it so far. I downgraded a little. I was first using a Samsung Gravity Touch and then a HTC HD2 (which is what I was using when I ditched the contract and got the Theory). I thought I would miss the features of my touch screen phone but I actually don't. I am personally happy to leave the pressure of using an advanced, trendy phone behind and to go back to something basic.

This phone has no music player feature which is ok with me. I carry a mp3 player with me all the time anyway. But the camera is POOR. I like to take a lot of pictures and upload them to Facebook so this is a bit of a set back. I know have to carry my camera with me if I want decent pictures.

Also...although I can text easily (even with having large hands and fingers), I can't text much in one text. Maybe there is a way to get around this but each text only allows 160 characters which limits you if you tend to send long thoughts in a text as I do.

Other than that, I am pleased with the phone. The browser was not that great either but I download Opera Mini and it has improved.",263,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,4.0,positive,"Works well as a modern phone without all the bells and whistles of an iPhone or droid phone.  You can't play music on it, but if you go online and download Opera Mini you can use your Boost Unlimited Internet on it and it functions and looks just like a regular computer.  Opera Mini is also about a thousand times faster (literally) than the browser that comes with the phone.  Great value for what you pay.  It is way more cost effective than a smart phone.",86,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,3.0,neutral,"If I could, I would have rated it 3.5.  The Theory is an impressive looking phone with a nice screen and an easy-to-use QWERTY keyboard, although the Call and End keys are awkwardly placed and sized.  Calls are nice and clear, and my reception and data speeds (2.5G) are pretty good considering I'm on the very edge of Boost's coverage.  Battery life is better than I expected too.  However, there are several drawbacks.  The web browser is bad.  It's ugly, every page you view has a heavily pixelated advertisement at the top, and you get a bare-bones rendering of any website you go to.  I would highly recommend downloading Opera Mini and using that as your browser instead.  The camera also leaves much to be desired.  Even at the Theory's highest resolution, photos are small and of poor quality when you get them onto a computer (USB cable is not supplied); I frequently have to override the white balance ""auto"" setting to get proper color correction; photos are often overexposed--even indoors with the exposure at -2--and there's no flash.  Without a video camera and music player, this is a poor multimedia phone.  If you just want to text/talk/surf (through Mini) on a phone that has that Blackberry style, it's a worthwhile buy, but only through Boost: the Theory is definitely not a phone you would want to get locked into a contract for, unless you were getting it for free.",240,5

The web browser is much better and the over all phone looks nice and sleek, and it's very light.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0057BE9PO,3.0,neutral,"The Theory itself is a great phone....the one I had originally was perfect with no problems! This one has a few quirks, such as after relatively few text messages are sent, I receive a message saying my text somethin somethin is 80% full. I never got that message before and did thousands of texts. So I have to go in and delete all conversations to get it cleared.

Also several times when I've had a call come in, I can't take it just by pressing the green button, I have to press the up, down and middle buttons on the main center area then go to the green and take the call. I think it's refurbished or something else is wrong. I'm not happy about that cause I won't take the time or aggrivation to send it back and get another one or a refund. I don't have the time.

Eventually, the signal died completely in my area making the phone useless. I ended up having to go to another phone, and a contract once again.  For some reason, I've not had the best of luck with Motorola. I'm not sure if it's just getting the occasional ""lemon"",  or what.  On this occasion, the phone didn't do what I expected of it.

-You can only text 160 characters at a time.

-Then you also recieve texts 160 characters at a time so I text may come in as 3 or 4 texts but the worst part is they often come out of order so you have to piece it together.

-The default text setting seems to be abc rather than Abc so I text in all lower case rather than starting sentences with a capital and I can't figure out how to change it.

-When I recieve a picture text the picture is so small that I can't usually tell what it is and there is no way to make it bigger.

-Internet won't conect at all. This was to be my 1st 'smart phone' and it does nothing a smart phone should.

-Randomly shuts down and restarts at weird times.

-Randomly loses service in places where my hubby's Prevail (also with Boost) has great service.

One of them fit perfectly, and she loves it.  This one, however, refuses to snap together in all six places, so it simply can't stay on the phone.  Too bad, because she loves the color, and it would have been nice if it worked.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0058WQ7Z2,4.0,positive,"At this price point, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality, but the the surprise is that it's pretty darn good.  The case comes in two pieces which snap together around the phone, but not very tightly.  I am guessing if dropped, the case might pop apart which could undermine the reason for the case in the first place.  However the case fits my Torch exactly with a small ""cushion"" of air between it and the phone that should protect it if it is dropped (but I sure wouldn't test it).

The front is raised slightly higher than the face of the phone which helps prevent screen scratches.  The case is hard plastic, but is covered with a rubberized material that seems to be making its way onto alot of electronic products these days.

My only beef is the shipped product is not exactly as pictured on Amazon.  The pictured product shows a window on the back that surrounds the BlackBerry logo (similar to iPhone cases which show the Apple logo).  The case I received doesn't have that.  I chose this case for this very reason because I wanted to 'flash' that I have a BlackBerry instead of an iPhone.",202,3

I rated this a 4 star because the only way to use it with my iPhone 4 was to modify the stick on ring.  The ring covers the flash if you want the ring in the middle so the lens is centered.
I ended up taking a pair of side cutters and cutting a small section out of the ring.  I stuck it on and it works great and does not impede the flash.
Just keep in mind that the flash is still blocked when you use the lens but will not be blocked without the lens.  I use my phone's flash a lot for a flashlight so it was important that it was not blocked.

PROBLEMS: Even though the kit comes with adhesive stickers to attach the magnets to the Iphone case, they don't work well. I had to use super glue to keep the magnets on.  Also, the Telephoto lens looked liked serious fun until I realized I had to focus both the Iphone and the Telephoto at the same time to achieve the best clarity.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005CERU0M,2.0,negative,"This looked like a great inexpensive addition to my new IPhone 4. My wife had a couple of lenses for her phone (fisheye and macro)  that were fun. The kit came with no instructions. The fisheye, macro and wide angle lenses are magnetic and there is a small metal ring that mounts to the phone with adhesive (peel and stick) I first put the ring on the phone, then the added the case and the magnets weren't strong enough to hold the lens on - the slightest jostle and they fell off. So I removed the ring and put it on the case rather than the phone and they stayed on better, tho I had to super glue the ring to get it to stay put. Then I discovered that if I used the flash on the phone camera it reflected a white fog onto half the photo. I thought it was reflecting on the ring and filed it down and it improved some but there was still a haze on a good part of the photo. Then I realized the flash was reflecting on the case itself. Not good! A large part of the reason I had upgraded my phone was because the camera technology was so much better on the Iphone 4 and 5 so I was not interested in a case that would not allow use of the flash. I bought a different case and a different version of a fisheye lens that clips on over the case and solved the flash problem, but there is no way to secure that cool telephoto lens without the case...",270,28

For the price you can't buy even one regular lens. It's like a set of starter lenses. They are cheap but work really well. You can't expect professional quality for this price.

-Cost
-Light Weight
-Easy to Assemble/ set up
-Don't take up a lot of space
-Fun to use
-Decent lenses for what you pay
-Easy to set up tripod
-Great way to find out if you like iPhone attachments

CONS:
-They Can be a little finicky. You have to adjust them just right so that you can get the whole picture.
-Almost need another bag for the lenses
-You have to glue something to your iPhone.. I just placed a screen protector over the back of the phone before I applied the washer.

I've asked for some people and all them has the same opinion, so this is our feedback, not only mine.
Another point that the ad isn't saying explicitly is that the metal ring must be stuck at the iPhone and is not a simple magnetic link between phone and lens.
I don't recommend it for anyone. Don't buy.",144,57

They give you little metal rings to stick to the phone, but the sticky stuff they give you does not work well. It all comes apart when you knock it.

On the other hand, the tripod is brilliant. There are so many other things you could use it for. It's not really robust and could break, but it IS an inexpensive product! My husband took it into work and all his co-workers wanted one.

Secondly, if you have an iPhone 4S, this case/lens set does work and fits with too.

Now with that out of the way, this Lens set is GREAT!
I was skeptical at first, but was glad to be reassured that this is a quality purchase.

I don't know why all the other reviews are so low.  This item is perfect, especially for what it offers.
- a 8x Telephoto Lens
- a Macro Lens/Wide Angle Lens
- a Fisheye lens

...plus...
- lens covers for all the lens listed above
- a custom case
- a mini iPhone bag
- a cloth wipe
- a tripod adapter
- and a mini tripod!

If anyone has been looking, all the other lenses available are so expensive considering this is just for an iPhone camera.

I've very satisfied with the package.  I'm thinking the low ratings have to be from other competitors who don't want you to buy this set, because they want you to buy the OlloClip ($70) or the iPro Lens ($200) or Photo Jojos ($20 each lens).

Now, if anyone encounters a problem with the magnets and the metal rings not sticking as I did, just follow the advice of "" ""JohnnyV"" entitled:  Very satisfied after a little modification., February 22, 2012. ""

By far my favorite is the fisheye lens. (If I had it to do all over again I'd purchase the 3-in-1 lens kit because I'm not sure how much value I'll get out of the telephoto lens or the tripod.

* The metal ring covers the flash on the iPhone 4 and newer models - If you use the ring with the notch cut out of it, it will not cover the flash.
* The ring won't stick to the phone - I used a very strong glue (Gorilla glue) to glue the ring to the plastic case that the Black Telephoto Lens attaches to.  This way you do not mess with the finish of your iPhone and the ring glued to the Telephoto case does not interfere with the use of the telephoto lens.
* I only got 3 lenses, not 4! - HINT, the Wide Angle lens UNSCREWS and the smaller lens is your MACRO LENS, now you have 4 lenses!
* Completely useless - well as they say about some people, you can't fix stupid.

I am giving this product only 4 stars because of the issue of the rings not sticking to the phone as well as they should.  They should have been glued into the Telephoto Lens case originally.",213,80

Only 3 of the 4 lenses came, and the only option provided to me is to send back and reorder and hope for better outcome, but based upon other reviews this seems a chronic problem, so next I could get fewer or damaged lenses.  The lenses look fun, but they are very cheaply made, the rings don't stick well, and you also have to turn your flash off in order get a picture that is not destroyed by the flash.  My biggest complaint is NOT having gotten all 4 lenses and being in a growing list of customers with the same complaint.  If your thinking about buying this item...BEWARE!!!!",128,81

The wide angle, fisheye, and macro lens work great. Better quality than I expected for the price. The kit came with several metal rings to attach the magnetic lenses to, about half had cut outs to accomodate the iPhone flash. The metal ring fits fine on my phone case.
The magnetic lenses hold fairly firmly to the ring, but I would not shake or jostle the phone too hard or the lens my come off.

The telephoto zooms in about as much as my iPhone's digital zoom, but using the telephoto with the iPhone zoomed all the way out provides a better image. It is the cheapest built lens of the group, but works pretty good.

The phone tripod mount is simple and versatile.  The tripod is tiny and may tilt over with the telephoto lens attached, but it did not in my quick test.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005D7HBFW,1.0,negative,"UPDATE:  Initially, I wrote a great review for this product and referred it to many friends.  However, after a few months of very careful use, the plastic around the cables broke leaving the wires exposed.  Not only does this not look good, it's dangerous.  Unfortunately, Phonesuit doesn't stand behind it's products AT ALL.

A great product at first, but poorly made.  I assume that one of the reasons the price keeps dropping is that they know about the problem and are making no effort to fix it.

I've had this for about four months and it has performed like a champ.  It has charged everything I travel with - Surface, iPhone 6s, iPad, iPad keyboard, bluetooth headset.  I usually bring a couple of spare cable so that I can charge three devices at once overnight, but I can also walk out the door with just this and my phone and know that I have a great all in one charging solution.

I especially like that the lightning and micro usb plugs are designed to fit very snug.  I can, in a pinch, actually plug the charger into the wall and the lightning connector into my iPhone at the same time.  Although the cable is not very long, my iPhone will stay in securely even if it can't reach the desk or the floor.  I don't recommend this, but I've done in numerous times and it has once fallen off.

It's especially great when headed out for the night with a low battery, since you can slip it in your pocket and know that you can recharge your devices no matter where you are.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005IT0J22,2.0,negative,The case doesn't fit on the phone correctly. Part of the case covers up the phone sensors and the phone will not light back up until you take the case off. I ended up just cutting the piece of the case with scissors so that it would not affect the sensors. Overall I was not satisfied due to the fact that the case does not fit all the way and the two components don't fit with each other as well as I thought they would.,85,33

At first I loved the case - it fit perfectly. But after time I guess it started to stretch out or something. It constantly falls off and is more annoying than helpful. My hubby bought himself the black version of this case and it's still perfectly snug! Also, since it's silicone, it gets stuck on everything (which I knew would happen) but if you like to put your phone in your pocket or tight pocket in your purse, you won't be able to get it out quickly.

Absolutely met my expectations (a lightweight, comfortable, over-the-head headset that would me workout without having to tote my iPhone around with me).  The set sounds good, had great range (roughly 100 feet), and connects easily.  It's also nicely solid feeling.  Sometimes with headsets, in an effort to go for lightweight, manufacturers have created flimsy feeling headsets.  Not this one.  It's solid feeling, substantial.  It doesn't feel like it's going to break the first time you use it.  Yet, it's not overly heavy either.  Basically, it's a great headset that does exactly what it advertises.

Looked for quite a while for this type of wireless over-the-head headset after I was disappointed with many flimsy ones that hang free off the ears and never quite hold tight as promised.  The sound quality is not perfect but good enough for exercise both outdoor and gym. Would not use it for airplane or chilling out on the couch. The only major disappointment is battery. Ideally they should have used the top area of the arc and place additional fitted battery to increase the time. Also the materials are not top notch, but good investment for the money overall.",111,18

I still use the first pair (sold as Scosche HZ-8) and bought this pair as a spare and for the very handy case.  The configuration of the speakers directs the sound to my ear canals, rather than against my ear as with many earphones.  The pair is lightweight, and if adjusted correctly they are very comfortable to wear.  I detest headphones with wires and found these to pair easily with my computers or iPhone and iPad.",87,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,5.0,positive,Great running headphones I have used Bluetooth running headphones for years and these have to be the best they are comfortable and easy to use and loud for running outside and overall retain a good charge and deliver many hours of music before recharging.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,4.0,positive,"I really like this headset. Light weight, decent audio quality. Recharges via USB.

One small problem: there seem to be a bit of a manufacturing control issue on the ear pieces. The edge of the earpieces is fairly sharp plastic -- it dug into my ear and became very uncomfortable. A minute or so with an emery board fixed it.",60,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,3.0,neutral,"The sound is good on this headset.  I bought to use while working out and running.  I've not had any of the issues other purchasers have listed with the exception of it making my ear canal sensitive if I wear it for long periods of time.  I use it at work to listen to music and walk around my office and away from my phone without any issues.  I would recommend this device and would buy another one.

I have an update to my review 3/11/14.  I am finally able to run outside and unfortunately, the other reviews I've read about it not working well if in a running belt are correct.  It's like you're listening to a skipping record.  If I take my phone out of the belt and carry it, it's better.  I'm not sure why motion effects the headset, but my next try will be to put my phone in an armband.  So for now, I'm reducing my review star from a 4 to a 3.",169,28

I absolutely love the size, volume, quality of calls, and fit. The unit itself looks very durable and well made. The first 30 days of using this headset, was GREAT and I was giving them a 5 out of 5. During the second 30 days, switching between music and calls became sporadic, and turning the unit on was taking increasingly longer. Today, I'm less than 90 days in, and it took close to 5 minutes to turn the unit on.

Matter of fact I forgot my IPhone at a tread mill wondering across the gym to another machine before I realized it. I really enjoy the no wires while working out and listening to music and movies on my IPad while on an airplane. The only issue was there was a plastic bur around the ear bud left by manufacturing. I took an emery board and lightly sanded down the rough edge and all is good. Not to mention if I didn't like them Amazons return policy is too generous making it very easy to shop with no concerns.

As such, I called it quits and returned the 2nd set for a refund.

It pretty much got to the point that in order to to get anywhere near 45 minutes out of them i had to charge them immediatley before use.  If you expect to charge them Thursday night and use them Saturday morning, don't expect more than maybe 20-30 mins.  At this rate, I am guessing within a few months they won't even hold a charge.",113,44

3.)  They stay on the head while working out
4.)  They are comfy

These are OK on all but number 4.  They put this effort into a good set of headphones, yet use hard plastic earbuds that kill the ears! Do they even try the products they design?  If they only used a in the eary soft bud, these would be great.  This is my sixth pair of bluetooth headphones I must return. This is getting ridiculous. Any suggestions?

I'm impressed. Great product.",63,47
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LL8IFM,2.0,negative,"I really liked this headset and wanted to give it a 5 star, but.....they don't hold up to heavy sweating. Very comfortable fit and on a scale of 1-10 the sound quality was a 7. It could use a little more volume. Battery life was so so. I went through 2 pairs of these and each one failed after 3 work outs. I am speculating it was sweat that got them. They would just quit working. Sometime they would start working again after a few days but were very intermittent after the first failure. If they had held up to the sweat I would be using them now. If you are not a heavy sweater then they may work fine for you.
I have been using the Jaybird JF3MB Freedom Bluetooth Buds for over 2 months now and they have not failed me yet. And their sound quality is a 10 on a scale of 1-10.",156,48

That part is fine. What hasn't been fine is how the sound varies every time I put them on, based on how it's fitting into my ears. Sometimes the sound is fine, sometimes it's muffled, and I haven't yet found any way of getting that to be consistently good. Most bluetooth headsets have some options that allow adjustment in fit, but that isn't true for this unit. It may work very well for some, but unfortunately not for me.",102,49

I just purchased an ASUS Transformer 3 (which is great) and figured I could use the headsets with it.  Nope.  I get an ""invalid passcode"" error when I try to pair it.  I can't find any manuals online or anything helpful at all from the manufacturer.  Would be great to have some support.

This little wonder makes it so much easier to send texts on my Droid X2. The instructions need to be
improved. A simple 1,2,3,4 set of instructions would be a great help. Once it is set up the connection stays and you do not have to re-set unless you turn of the cell or for some reason you lose the electronic leash.

Setting up and Re-seting is easy if you follow the info below. The keyboard battery is charged by connecting the provided cable to USB port on computer. Just remember to keep it charged.

Once I actually plugged it in to use it, I noticed that there was a very minor buckle in the silicone where it is attached to the battery. It made typing nearly impossible.

This will make it much easier to use the phone, even though the phone has its own keyboard - which is just too small for anything but a quick note.

The instructions that came with the keyboard are less than detailed but it does work. The only thing I'm not clear on right now is the battery - leaving the USB connection plugged in for a few hours apparently charged the battery as the LED went out - maybe that means it's fully charged? - the instructions don't say - but it works right now so I'll just see how long it works.

I opened the package to see it contained a rubberized bluetooth keyboard and about 4 pages of instructions.  I opened the package and found no USB-> mini-USB charge cord for the keyboard.  Luckily I had a spare laying around the house.  Once charged (admittedly for only approximately a half hour) I turned on the keyboard.  The keyboard was recognized by my Samsung Galaxy S II phone and pairing was as simple as following the onscreen instructions and inputting the 6 digit password.  Here is where things went awry.

The product is small as warned by previous reviewers; however, I could have been able to work around that.  I immediately opened Quickoffice and created a new word document.  The bluetooth keyboard only picked up intermittent keystrokes.  Sometimes it would pick up the wrong key entirely.  I though this may be a problem with Quickoffice, but when I tried it in a simple text window I had the same results.  I thought it may have been the result of a low battery, so I allowed the keyboard to charge for 4 more hours.  To my dismay, I yielded the same results.

I am returning this product as defective/not working as advertised.  It did not work with my Samsung Galaxy S II as a previous commenter has noted.  Better luck to anyone who takes a chance on this keyboard... I do not recommend this product.",272,37

The instruction on the 4-page manual didn't help, instructions are almost not related to the product, it is does not give proper instructions and there's no helpdesk number to call for assistance.

Even if I do nothing on the phone, it still needs recharging at the end of the day. This is after I have taken all the recommended suggestions for minimising power usage. Seriously, it should last at least a couple of days on one charge with minimal usage. Also, it takes an eternity to recharge.

I find this phone really annoying, because it promises so much, yet the rubbish battery puts a big dent in my overall opinion. I've checked on some replacement batteries - Mugen looks super powerful but too bulky, Anker looks like a bit of a boost for a reasonably fair outlay.

I agree with the other reviewer about removing the back case - wow, is that hard! I'm scared I'll break the thing. Also, USB connector to the phone is very difficult to fit in the socket.

I'm surprised at the high ratings - is battery life not so important? Do you all really think it's acceptable to need a recharge every day with minimal usage? I'd hate to be an avid Youtube viewer or music listener - the power would be out before the end of the day. Although I've put three stars, I'll give it a rating of 2 1/2.",223,10

PROS
-It has dual core, 1.5Ghz processor ,there is no lag and I have been on flash heavy sites, been playing lots of different games which demand alot from the processor .
-The display is very crisp. Colors are sharp and very nice.
-Audio quality is very good. The beats setting gives you more bass which I like.
-Its metallic finish is simply perfection.
-Photos are amazing.

CONS
- I did not receive any beats audio headphones when I bought this product. I emailed the seller and I even emailed HTC themselves, but didn't get much help. They both said that it was shipped in the box, however I just got the standard headset. I have nothing to disprove them,  felt as tho I was robbed,, its nonsense cause I didn't get what I had paid for. The seller wanted to give me a $20 refund to compensate for the ""lost"" headphones, but that won't replace it, nor would it be able to buy a pair of beats audio in-ear headphones. Obviously I was very disappointed.

Pros:
- Phone goes on very easily using only one hand to mount.
- Supports phone both with and without a case.
- Includes USB cable.
- Charges and syncs just as advertised with a single cable.
- Sharp Looking

Cons:
- Small lightweight base allows it to slide around on desk when pushing/swiping screen.
- Cable takes a little work to mount into cradle when you first set it up.
- Difficult to remove phone from cradle with just 1 hand.
- Phone is a little wobbly/top heavy.  again because of the small lightweight base)

-USB cable is WAY too short

My S3 has a typical snap on case from Zazzle.  The connector is too short, it will not charge my phone unless I remove the case.  If you have anything other than a basic bumper case, it will not work.  If you have something like an Otter Box, don't even waster your time.

I use it now and I love it. Really like that it is so small you can barely tell it is on my nightstand. My only complaint is it can be tricky to get your phone hooked up.

I'm sure it will work fine with no or a thinner case.

I had read reviews complaining if instability but since my main intent was to simply sync and charge my Galaxy S2 I figured this was a good option. I wanted a simple and stylish dock that would fit my phone with a hard case. This ended up not being it. The dock uses an awkward plastic piece that the usb cable fits into. As stated the us cable included is white which clashed with the style of the black station. The little plastic holder snaps into place but is an awkward fit. The little plastic tabs broke right off of it while trying to juggle the piece. This resulted in one cut thumb, a lot of inappropriate language on my part, and an unusable dock. I'm returning it and giving up on finding a dock that will actually fit the phone with it's cover.

When it didn't work with that phone, I tried it with my Galaxy Nexus (with a TPU gel cover on), and it works fine.

Both phones have the same charging cable and wall adapter, so it doesn't really make sense.

I'll keep it for my Nexus, buy something else for the S3. It's an otherwise nice-looking, functional charging dock.

The main complaint I have is that it's just too unstable with your s2 in it.
It's pretty much at risk of being knocked over with any touch, or brushing against the cable etc... honestly.

So if you simply want a nightstand and charger, and you'll never plan on touching it while docked, then go ahead.

As for the design, it is clever in its appearance but really unsuitable for the Nexus Galaxy.

- Only the USB jack holds the phone in place. This means that when you try to interact with the phone while it's docked it wobbles badly. Having so much weight and tension on the mini USB port is a tremendous engineering oversight, and will likely become trouble some day soon.

- The curved design is nice, but it's made from acrylic, so it's exponentially lighter than it should be. This means that when you try to interact with the phone while it's docked it likes to scoot around.

- All models of this phone are black, and the base is black, but for some reason the included proprietary cable is bright white. It's an annoying incongruence.

This allows the phone to tilt left or right.  very unstable.  also the size of this phone for this stand is to big.  It wants to fall over backwards if touched.  This is not worth $20.  $9.99 maybe is a better price for it.  I give it 2 stars because it actually does charge the phone and it will hold the phone in place if you don't touch it.

Since the phone cables do not communicate with my computers (windows 7 & samsung galaxy s2 skyrocket), having them used with your computer is useless.  They should have supplied an ac adapter, and advertised to be used without a computer.  This would have been far more honest and accurate.

And as the others mentioned, why the white cord when the rest is black?

The cable can't be easily swapped out because of the micro USB adapter's unique shape. It's also a white cable, which looks cheezy with all my other black cables.

You have to use your own power adapter because one is not included with the stand. That again makes this product incomplete.

For $50 the better product is the Samsung kickstand for the Galaxy SII. It includes a solid stand, an extra battery and a place to charge the battery while it is not in the phone. It's not perfect either but is a much better value and looks professional.

Pushing on buttons or the screen will just slide the dock around, you almost have to use two hands to perform any actions while the phone is docked.  Due to the design when docked it becomes very top heavy as well.

Also would prefer it used a standard USB cable instead of a proprietary one, which is white (ugh) and very short.

So, not the most stable dock, must use included cable, and you still need a USB Wall Charger if you want to Charge with AC.  Even with all that, it's usable, and works with cases.

However two things that I notice that may be problematic for other people are that the mirror tends to muck up a bit easier than my old screen protector, and it is really difficult to use while outside when it's sunny.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005P2OCDY,4.0,positive,"I love this guy!  This is the perfect accessory for a place like Los Angeles, where looking good is almost as essential as having a cell phone. This really does turn your Samsung into a makeshift mirror - in a pinch, I've used it to put on eyeliner, touch up makeup, gaze at myself when bored, obsess over a budding pimple, etc.

The great thing is, even though you may effectively be walking down the street staring into a hand mirror, no one has to be the wiser.  That is, no-one on the street needs to know you're secretly engrossed in your appearance; to the casual observer, you're simply engrossed in your phone, maybe watching a video, or reading a text message.

For people more concerned with things like ""using your phone"", fear not - this protector is pretty seamless as well. I've never had problems with the touchscreen not registering, etc. I noted other reviews talking about scratches and durability, but I've had this for a while and nothing's really scratched. It does pick up fingerprints like mad, but I'd rather the prints be on the protector than the actual screen itself. That's what you're buying a protector for, right?

I took off one star because the glare can make it difficult to see the screen in bright light. (Still works great as a mirror, though.) That being said, the daylight glare issue is a relative curse affecting nearly every smartphone. Even without the protector I would still have that problem. But I do believe the reflective quality of the mirror accentuates the glare, hence the star knock-off.

I'd still highly recommend this product for those who dream of transforming their phones into a trusty pocket mirror.  Don't be shy - you know who you are!",297,47

They look really cool and I thought the over-ear design would help block out ambient noise to give a fuller auditory experience while jammin' out to my fave tunes.  There's a lot to like, but the one key factor where these fall flat is the overall volume -- it's just way too low.  I boost most of my MP3s by a few decibels to hit the volume I like, but these Halo2s still don't pump anywhere near enough volume.  It you're stuck on Jabra, maybe try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jabra-SPORT/dp/B005FVNHBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jabra SPORT</a>; despite their compact size, mine seemed to go much louder and sound better than these Halo2s.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,I mainly use these with my phone at work to listen to music but I have also used them for making calls just so I don't have to hold the phone or put it on speaker phone.  People on the other end do say it sounds a little more distant than just talking directly into the phone and I'm not entirely sure where the mic(s) are to pick up my voice but other than that they work well and the sound quality is good.  It's nice how they fold up to store them without much space and connecting it to my phone for the first time was very easy so I had no issues using them or figuring things out.  They do kind of fall off my head if I look down rather easy sometimes since they are not super snug (I have a small head though).  I like how they look and feel and have no real complaints other than what others have said about not being able to hear me as well on the other end of the line though.,182,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,3.0,neutral,"The Jabra halo2 is an OK Headset in a world where there is not a lot to choose from. I would be impressed if I had not used a sony stereo bt before.  With the sony I never had connection problems, the range was great and the controls worked flawlessly.

Now the jabra has a cute sleek look, but the functionality and quality is a bit off in my opinion.

1. They  have the same control for changing the song as adjusting the volume so I end up adjusting the volume when I dint want to. You slide your finger up the side to adjust the volume and double tap to change the song. Double tapping is tricky and sometimes have to try several times to get it to change the song. On the sony I had a dedicated button for each and a single clik would restart the current track and double click would change. But on the jabra there is no way to restart the same song and there is no use of the single click function.

2. They have been working hard to increase the base and they suceeded pretty much, but at the expense of treble, so if you like a lot of base and no top end this might for you. You definately need a phone/player with an equalizer to listen music with this thing.

3. Battery life, sony could go a couple days on one charge while jabra plays for about six hours max.

In general its just OK, especially if you have never used a stereo bt headset before and have nothing to compare it to.",273,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,4.0,positive,"I just bought this yesterday so I can't give an expert opinion, only first impressions.

I don't think I'm an audiophile although my friends say that I am. This headset meets my standard of good sound delivery, keeping in mind that it will largely depend on the quality of your music files.

I'm having 3 main issues with the headset so far, and they are not trivial:
First, is the skipping, yes it does skip a lot. Especially when you first connect it through Bluetooth, but also randomly during music play and without an apparent cause. This has not however reached a point of frustration. It mostly runs smooth, but when it starts to happen you sort of want to curse it.

Second, it didn't connect with my PlayStation 4. This was quite disappointing. Apparently the PS4 is unable to recognize its profile or something of that sort. So it's unlikely that there would be a solution.

Third, is the Bluetooth range. You could go no more than I would say 7 meters away from the host device or it would immediately start the skipping thing.

At this price, however, and the sound quality, and the comfort level. I would say I am satisfied. you could be too if keep your expectations proportional to the price.",216,39

1) Even if you are right next to the device emitting the signal there will be gaps in the playback like the audio is struggling to load.

In addition, my other (much cheaper) set of Bluetooth headphones work fine and do not have this problem. This is incredibly infuriating.

2) There is no power button, which is quite annoying, but I knew this when I bought them. I figured that it wouldn't be a problem because you just fold them shut to turn them off. HOWEVER, the construction feels very flimsy and I feel like every time I close them I am within a hair's breadth of breaking them, even when using the utmost caution and care.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,1.0,negative,"Birthday present from my girlfriend 2.5 years ago. I've spent years semi-obsessed with wireless audio having previously bought the massive sennheiser RS120s, which was based on radio frequency, the quality wasn't great, but the range went up to 25 feet.
I've owned a lot of bluetooth earpieces from samsung and all have paired very easily with my iphone.

My initial experiences with this headset included frequent disconnects, constant switching from mono to stereo quality sound, poor and frustrating call quality with my girlfriend, and not the most comfortable thing to wear as it presses tightly against my temple. I mostly have decided to use my 10-15 year old sony walkman (remember portable cd players?) to listen to music on my laptop, and wired earbuds for my phone.

I recently found this old bluetooth headset again while on a teleconference, and was reminded of many of these same problems of connecting to my computer, and loss of stereo quality. With some frequent disconnecting and reconnecting and installing and uninstalling drivers, it works again on my laptop in mono quality. I had bought a pair of kinovo/soundbot bluetooth headphones that are superior in sound quality and reliability for cheaper. Good riddance to old wireless audio technology.

I use the headset in my home office to give me hands free cell phone connection while I do remote service.
The good:
The headset is lightweight and rests lightly on the ears. I can still clearly hear other things going on in the room and my ears don't get too hot.
The microphone seems to perform well also as I never get complaints that my volume is too low or that I sound muffled.
Battery life is pretty long and if it gets low, I can plug the usb power in and continue using it...really nice.
Bluetooth connects and stays connected as expected.

Plus:
Good sound quality

It even works as a USB sound card/headphones with laptops and desktops  (Disables BlueTooth functions)
Can be connected to 2 devices at the same time.  (one devices in Headset mode, and one device in headphone mode)

Minuses
Less than stellar build quality for the price
The soft padding and lining starts wearing off in a couple of weeks

It nice, but if I could wear earbuds I would have gotten a different headset for about the same price that does not have a ""Shedding"" problem.

5-1-2015 I have decided to lower the rating from 3 to 2 stars because of just how poor the build quality is.  I have gotten cheaper headphones that have lasted far longer.  The only reason it has 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the support.  Jabra replaced it 3 times over the warranty period.  The sound quality is good, but the fact that they fall apart is a big issue.  If they were to at least offer replacement ear pads then that would go a long way as they need to be replaced every 2 to 3 months.  (My current set has a tear in them)",225,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,3.0,neutral,"The title speaks for itself. These headphones are low profile and unobtrusive relative to most over the ear style headphones. Unlike many headphones, the bluetooth connection light and battery indicator are inside the headband, so you won't be walking around like an air traffic control tower with a light strobing on your head. The folding mechanism is handy for packing these in a bag or stowing in a jacket pocket, and it doubles as the on / off switch. Given their somewhat diminutive size, the sound quality is surprisingly good. The highs and mids are rich and clear, the bass just deep enough without any distortion. I had no problem pairing with an iPad, an Android phone, an HP Windows laptop and a Macbook.

One major drawback, the sound will frequently drop out if I step more than ten feet away from my phone or computer. Sometimes, if my phone is in my pocket I get the same results. The connection has been best when working at a desk and my phone is sitting two feet away.

She loved mine so much, and replaced her wired headphones with these. I find the sound to be clean and dynamic, and the ""virtual surround"" works pretty well.

PROS:
* The dynamic range of these headphones is pretty broad
* The sound is clear and defined
* Operation is easy - on/off is by unfolding the headset, volume control is by touching the right cover and sliding, and it's easy to find the side with the controls because of the finger dip in the cover.
* Very comfortable and light weight
* long battery life. They say about 8 hours, but I usually get about 3 nights use out of them (I use them when I go to bed, until I wake in the morning)
* Comes with a cord in case you want to physically plug it into your phone or MP3 player (instead of Bluetooth)
* They fold up small

CONS:
* Pairing could be a little easier, as finding the pairing control is not obvious. Once you figure it out, it's fine
* The charger needs to plug into 110v. It would be nice if you could plug it into a USB socket

I have heard of complaints that they are hard to fold/unfold, but I do not find this at all. I just gently bend them at the hinge point, and they close up (or open up) easily.

However, when used Google talk, worked for me little better than streaming music(really worse).

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,3.0,neutral,"....and these didn't quite do it for me.... I'm returning them and have the Harmon BT headset on order...

These didn't do it for me in the sound department. They didn't sound bad, however, they didn't block out conversation in a relatively quiet office space. I was led to believe that there was some sort of active noise cancellation in these... Maybe I read it wrong... I didn't bother trying a phone call with them, however I did an A/B comparison between the headset mic and the mic in my MacBook Pro. It didn't sound horrible, but it wasn't as good as the MBP mic...

ALSO, these were a little uncomfortable due to an abnormally large cranium. Well, I'm in the 95th percentile... This may have effected the sound. My big head made the earpads not sit well on my ears. There was a gap at the bottom. When I held them against my ears (gently) the bass was much more prominent. That pretty much happens with any headset, however, I'm telling you that I pressed them enough to just touch the bottoms of my ears...

That said, they're still really cool... Super light... I probably would have kept them if they fit me good...",205,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,"Like other reviewers, I discovered it is not reliable with my Macbook Pro (sometimes it works, sometimes it sounds like a tin can and often it clicks and goes dead). It also will not connect to my HTC telephone. Surprisingly, it works wonderfully with my iPad, but sadly that wasn't my intended use for the headset.

It looks good and is comfortable. However, the black felt-like fabric picks up hair and dust and after a short time on my head it resembled my dog's bed.",85,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,5.0,positive,"Jabra tricked me. Don't tell anyone but I think they raided the Bose warehouse and stole their headset components:-).  All kidding aside, the Halo2 delivers incredible sound and I cannot believe they did it at such a low price.",39,99
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,2.0,negative,"This works well when listening to music, but any two-way communication leaves a lot to be desired. Using as a gaming headset has your playing partners asking you to repeat stuff, and when using the phone sometimes ghosts out.  Music is great though.  I sometimes take the set off of my head because I think I hear something ""over there"", but then realize it was in the music I was listening to.",72,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PUZO92,3.0,neutral,"The first surprise came when I opened the Amazon shipping box.  My new Jabra HALO2 Headphones were solidly encased in absolutely the worst packaging EVER!! Horrible!! To get inside you need power tools and heavy metal gloves to get past the sharp, dangerous plastic. Not for use by humans.  Us older folk need packages that are a lot easier to open.  But, after much grief and pain, I did get to the product and found, somewhat to my surprise after my initial reactions, that I liked what I found.  The bluetooth synched well with both my iPod Touch and my Nexus 7, it was a ""painless"" experience and all I have to do now is turn on both sides of the stream, and off we go!  Well done.  I now use these headphones every day and enjoy the experience.  The sound quality is good (bluetooth is a ""lossy"" process, not as good as AirPlay - but a lot cheaper) and the 'phones have a reasonable dynamic range without sacrifices at both ends of the tonal scale.  The controls on the right speaker are clever and work as needed, but the one fault I have is that you have to close the phones to turn them off - there is no ""ON-OFF"" switch.  This is annoying and I am just waiting for it to break.  With one or two improvements these could be my go-to speakers and could easily earn another star in my review.",244,101

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,5.0,positive,"These earbuds are for personal listening on portable devices.  They're designed for sports, so they have an around-the-ear loop and a small chest clip for added stabilization.  They also have a slider to adjust the length of separation between the ear pieces.  They come with soft plastic ear plugs, and ship with 8 extra ear plugs, just in case you lose some or wear some out.  Also included in the package is a faux leather carrying case to reduce tangles if you want to carry the earbuds in your pocket, backpack, or purse.  These earbuds are light weight and comfortable, but most importantly, their sound quality is excellent.  Music really comes alive when you're wearing these earbuds!",117,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,"These are pretty decent headphones. I use both Jabra and Sennheiser and I think these are pretty comparable in sound quality. I do prefer Jabra out of all three of the brands though and I think they have the best sound quality and hold up the best. I think these are very durable though. The sound isn't at all tinny and the bass is perfect. I used these mainly while running at home on my elliptical. I can't blast my music because of my neighbors so I tend to just put headphones on and go the safe route. These fit really nicely and have a snug yet comfortable feel to them. They don't seem to irritate my sensitive ears either which is a plus.

I recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for jogging/exercising. These are awesome.",140,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,"Summary: I like these headphones. But I'd be hesistant with the price it asks for, it seems alittle steep for me, as the audio isn't that knock-out quality. But if you cant find something you like that is decent for a lower price range i think you won't regret buying these. I included a picture that hopefully gives you clearer idea of what it looks like/size. If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments.

More details:

Pro's
---------
-Long cord with clip included
-3.5 mm jack (didnt see this mentioned anywhere in the description but that's what it uses)
-Bunch of transparent earbuds included to get your proper fit + a carrying case which closes with an adhesive patch
-The music control works with Android gingerbread (cyanogen mod) with the program specifically used as Winamp. Pressing the button on the control starts and stops the music. If someone calls pressing the button also answered (though you have to press and hold for ~3 seconds to end call)
-No overemphasis on various aspects of sound ( i recently reviewed another headphone that over emphasised the bass for instance)
-The earclip is comfortable (made of soft, bendable plastic of sorts) and doesnt hurt, even with prolonged use.
-Easy to get on

Con's
---------
-Some more static than usual in calls
-Sound is crisp and i am no audiophile but definitely nothing knock-out that deserves the being called ""High-Definition Audio"" in my opinion
-Noise-cancelling could be better

Hope my review gave you some insight into this product. Thanks for reading!",261,2

But let's be honest, like me you will probably buy them anyway because 1) they are cheap, 2) they are Sony, and 3) there really are not many options for over the ear headphones with a mic and pause/play button. And like me you will likely be dissapointed.

Good luck.",96,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,3.0,neutral,I ordered these headphones because my previous pair would eventually stop working from sweat during long runs/workouts. Although the issue of sweat/moisture eventually stopping the headphones from working has been resolved the quality of the headphones is mediocre. The red trim that wraps around the ear fell out within a week or two. I also initially experienced some issues with the jack not sitting flush on my iPhone so the music would go in and out - but it has since occurred less frequently. For the price they're not bad but I wouldn't pay over $20 for them...probably would try another pair before reordering.,104,17

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,3.0,neutral,These headphones are okay. I'm not accustomed to the plug style of headphones and it creates a kind of suction that took me a while to adjust to. The suction does keep the sweat out of my ears. The sound is also pretty good.,44,23
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,5.0,positive,I work in a lab in which I get to keep to myself for most of the work day. I like to put these on an listen to podcasts for hours on end.

As soon as I started to use them in warmer weather where I was sweating, they wouldn't stay in my ear.  They aren't flexible so you can't adjust them to make them fit your ear.  For me, if I put the bud in my ear, they don't sit nicely on top of my ear so they fall out.  If they managed to stay on my ear, the ear bud isn't in my ear canal so I can't hear the music.  The part that goes around the ear needs to be made of a flexible material so that you can change the shape to fit the individuals ear size.  Would not buy again.  Don't use them anymore.",136,27

On the plus side, they do stay on my ears well enough. The ear loop is extra large though to accommodate all ear sizes. Instead of wrapping nicely around the top of my ear is goes an extra centimeter above the top of my ear before coming down again. This is not a deal breaker but it does mean that the fit is suboptimal.",115,37

It works great. However, the design is defected. The headphones have a small red plastics/rubber strip glued into a groove on each side. When the headphones are used, the strips touch the head and are exposed to sweat, which melts the glue. Then, the strips got loose, and stick out, making it uncomfortable to ware. Sooner or later, they will fall off, and sweat may find its way through the grooves into the headsets. Eventually, the headphones may be damaged by sweat.

I only use the headphones when I run. Not a very active runner, I only used the headphones for about 30 times since August, between 30-50 minutes each time.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,4.0,positive,"I picked these up from a local Verizon store, not Amazon (I get a 25% discount from them so it came out to $22 instead of $19.50... Oh well). I didn't notice it until I bought them, call me blind, but the cord comes from the ear loop and not the actual headset part; my old ones had the wire come from the headset piece itself, not the loop. No biggie, just wanted to point that out. At first they hurt my ears, but after about an hour they felt normal. The ear is loop less-rigid than I'm used to. I wouldn't call it flimsy, per se, but it is 'softer' than some of the other headsets with an ear loop. It doesn't make a lick of difference though because they stay in my ears very well; even when you sweat like crazy in the gym, like I do, they don't move.
They have a little microphone, which I've never used since I use these in the gym (I get in my 'Not Now Chief' mode), and a 'playback controller'; thats utter bull s***. All mine does is, aside from allowing me to talk to other people with the microphone, pause/un pause the music; there's no skip track feature which is a huge bummer. I don't want to have to take my phone out of my pocket (my armband hasn't come in the mail yet. When it does, I suspect that it will be less of an issue. But, until then...) to change my music. Other than those gripes, this is a nice piece of equipment so far, and I recommend them to someone looking for their next set of gym headphones.

Well, the earpiece is very comfortable, but not adjustable.  The buds wiggle out of my ear, and eventually fall out even with just moderate movement.  I'm not talking about hanging upside down, jogging,  running, boxing etc. They just don't make good contact with my ears, which are not unusually shaped.  Also, the sound quality is poor.  I have a pair of cheap Motorola earbuds that hang on the ear lobe which have much better depth of sound.

I have bought probably 5 or 6 headsets in the past decade. I've spent from $8 to $99. This was the worst.
Why?
1. Despite all the earpiece attachments, and I spent over 30 minutes testing them all, they don't stay in your ears.
2. The design of the wire that goes around your ear is wrong. It actually forces the earplug OUT of your ear because of the angle Motorola uses.
3. The sound quality sucks.
4. There is a noticeable drop in volume from these headphones to any other.

Frankly, after using them 4 times I was so frustrated I pulled them apart and threw them in the trash, which was pretty dumb since now I can't return them and get my money back.

Returned and reordered a set. Started to work out, 10 minutes in to the workout, one ear started cutting out. This happened for the next 10 minutes until I pulled them out.

+ Sporty design with red accents.
+ S, M, L sized sleeve which also comes with variants that allows external noise to be heard (e.g. road traffic noise).
+ Mic and control is nicely located.

- Average audio quality, especially for those who prefers strong bass.
- The silicon material is a little too stiff to fit nicely in the ear.

I cannot speak for the life of the Motorola SF200 Sports Headphones, as I have only used them for one day. So far, they work well.

PROS:
-Comfortable
-Good sound quality
-Reasonable bass for in-ear headphones
-Rubberized connector and cord will not easily become tangled or knotted
-3.5 mm Audio Jack
-Shirt clip is great when running ( the earbuds won't get pulled out, unlike certain other brand(s) I will not name)
-Will NOT slip off of the ears
-Additional earbuds and Carrying case

CONS:
-In-Line Controls do not seem to exist (unless I don't understand it)
-User Manual NOT helpful (except for an insurance agent, as it discussed damage insurance thouroughly)
-Over-the-ear piece may not fit all ear shapes
-Color of the cord means that it will be visible no matter what you wear (no black/white options, reddish-pink ONLY)

UNTESTED FEATURES:
-Hydrophobic (Water-resistant) ""Mesh"" lining
-In-Line Microphone
-MOTOACTIV connectivity (Do not own one, and do not plan to own one)
-Product Longevity

In conclusion, these are great headphones for the casual listener, and both the weekend-warriors and the fitness gurus. Not to down their products, but these $50 headphones (unless you buy them at Amazon!) blow away any similar Skullcandy product, as are so popular with todays youth. Definitely worth the money. I will try to write a new review in a few weeks, after attempting to test the features I haven't, and talking about product longevity.

This is a set I do not have to stress about using every day. I even use them during light drizzles. I did not have the issues a couple others mentioned about the mic not working.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,2.0,negative,"In the process now of contacting Motorola to get a replacement. My set that came with my Motoactv worked the first day with no problem. I tested all of the features out over the course of an hour and then put the actv away. Today I pulled it out (two days after receiving it) and went to go run but the headphones wouldn't play music. I'd hit play on the actv and it wouldn't play at all. When I went to my FM radio stations I got an error that I needed to plug in my headphones.

Needless to say I had to run with a set of headphones from another player (which by the way sound 10x as loud with more bass). When I got home I plugged them in while the music had just been working in the other headphones and again no music or radio. I could however hear all system beeps as I turned it on and off.

I tried unplugging and plugging it in, and it was seating fine but nothing. Twisting the wire near the plug produced some sound and then it would go off again. Just overall a big disappointment.

I'm going to get these replaced and keep them as a backup. But in no way shape or form are they as good as the competition and definitely don't hold up.",228,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,2.0,negative,"This is the first review I've ever written. These headphones lasted about three weeks before they began to malfunction. I ordered these headphones based on the positive reviews they received. However, the single negative review turned out to be spot on. The build quality is not what one would expect from Motorola. The wires seem too thin/light for a sports headphone and the mic with push-button feels very cheap (fragile). I used these with a Motorola Photon (Android phone) while exercising and working in the yard. I am a heavy sweater, so they get quite drenched. After about three weeks of ownership, while out for a brisk morning walk/run, my phone began dialing the last number I called as if I were pressing a redial button. I can no longer use them with my cell phone, although they still work well as stereo headphones when connected to a mp3 player. I now use the oem headphones with mic that came with my wife's NEXUS S smartphone. Even though I put a headband on to keep them in my ears, they sound great and the sweat hasn't caused them to malfunction. I cannot recommend these sports headphones due to their poor build quality.",202,103

I have average size ears, and by no means have I ever had problems with any other headphones fitting. These are just not meant for a runner or use during exercise. I wish that they would have made them adjustable so that the user could form them to their ear.

There are three choices of plug size. I would guess most people probably use the middle size and those are the ones that work for me.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,5.0,positive,"I go through headphones like no one's business as I wear to work, to the gym, outside when I jog, and when I ride my motorcycle.  While I have yet to try these new Motorola headphones on my motorcycle (something to do with North Dakota winter weather *shrugs*) I have had a chance to subject the SF200 headphones to virtually every other test I could think of and they're not bad.

I usually prefer my Skull Candy Titans, but they never stay on when I jog and they're too big to wear in my motorcycle helmet.  My Denon headphones suffer from similar issues and they're not as good as my Skull Candy so I decided to try something new when given the opportunity.

The SF200 are not too bad in terms of sports headphones.  They have decent sound, stay on my head, and are very durable thus far.  While jogging they don't come out as they wrap around my ears... problem is that they're uncomfortable.  Maybe I have big ears but I felt as though they were scrapping my ear lobes off.  The Ferengi in me disagrees completely.  Perhaps if they were larger they wouldn't be so uncomfortable.

All in all, the SF200 headphones would be great if they were more comfortable otherwise they do everything they set out to do.  In the meantime, I'm going back to my Denon and Skull Candy as they're comfortable and produce a far superior sound quality.",243,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,3.0,neutral,"As a music lover, I was enthusiastic to review Motorola's SF200 Sports Headphones. They were serving as a replacement for my JVC earphones I lost a few weeks ago. There are good and bad things about these sports headphones. The pros with the Motorola SF200 Sports earbuds mainly involve stability while exercising. There is a small clip included on the earphone wire to ensure that the speakers will not jostle about or come loose while someone is running on the treadmill or doing aerobic exercises. The speakers also hook around the ears, making them stable while working out. There are also multiple ear cushions to ensure you get the perfect fit with your earphones.

The cons with this product involve the sound quality and aesthetics of this product. The sound quality (especially the bass) is passable, but not the best you'll get with even $10 headphones/earbuds like JVCs(my second favorite brand) or apple earbuds (my favorite one). Like the recent earbuds, there are adjustable sound volume controls that will work with recent models of Ipods or mp3 players.  The over-the-ear clips didn't fit snugly around my ear.

I was sorely disappointed with the aesthetic appearance of this model. The color scheme won't be a nice, cherry red and black wire design. Instead, you'll be getting a red-orange and black color scheme. It reminds me of red-orange jumping cables used to start up cars. I wish there were different colors available for this product. Even though Apple Earbuds only come in white, it's still pleasing. JVC's make mutiple colors that individuals can choose from (and the sound quality, to me, is superior to Motorola's).

In my opinion, it's sound quality doesn't really compare to Apple's Earbuds which run around the same price. Motorola's product is a tad bit expensive considering the sound and the color scheme.",305,110

They are comfortable to wear and stay in place during a variety of exercise activities.  My only real complaint is that the sound quality is not as good as other ear-bud headphones that I have used.  The sound from my Bose in-ear headphones is clearly superior.  That said, the sound quality trade-off may be acceptable versus the features for sports activities that have been designed into these headphones.  I will continue to use them while exercising but will opt for the Bose in other situations.",104,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005PVXIVM,3.0,neutral,"These earphones come with four different-sized soft shells, but none of them would stay in my ear. The over-the-ear clip was fine, so the earphones stayed near enough to my ear to hear the music, but they needed to be in the ear to get reasonable sound quality. Obviously this wasn't a problem for some other reviewers, so I guess it depends on your ear shape. But I have never had trouble with similar earphones or earbuds before and I do not have unusually large or small ears.

If I held the earphones in my ears, the sound quality was acceptable, but nowhere near as good as other earphones in this price range. The bass was okay, often a problem in earbuds, but there was inadequate dynamic range and the sound was muddy. If you listen mainly to hard rock, you might not mind, but don't buy these for more complicated music.

On the other hand, the over-the-ear clips were comfortable and secure.",163,112

The package includes a small carrying case for the headphones and a variety of interchangeable ear buds to fit various sized ear canals.

The sound is excellent and the microphone quality is good for making calls.

This was my first official non-Tracphone and I got it for my freshman year of college : ) It worked perfectly for me and I had it for about 4 years before I started experiencing problems with it. It seemed like a cord was disconnected or something because it works while closed but stops working when I flip it up. This was fine, I just taped it shut, but then I couldn't text or call numbers I didn't already have in my contacts. I read reviews about this phone and there seemed to be a lot of complaints about the charging part of it, but I decided getting the phone I was familiar with was worth the risk. Long story short I ordered this phone, was super excited that it was new and still in its box, and put my old SIM card in it. This new phone does not charge the batteries. I have used the charger it came with, and 2 of my other chargers and it just does not charge.. it says it is charging but as soon as I unplug it, it goes back to ""low batterie."" It is not the end of the world though, I have been switching out the batteries and charging them with my old phone and then putting them back into the new one. It is a bit of a hassle, especially for long phone calls, but it is worth it too me to have the phone I want.

All other pairs got less then stellar reviews. this pair didn't have that many reviews but I saw some good ones and they were cheap especially with my Discover Card points. Plus im a sucker for the red design.

I got them and I really liked them. They fit well. Charged with the same micro usb I use for my Mophie case on my iPhone 4s. At first I thought they were JUST loud enough in my house listening to music. But after using them in a walk around the neighborhood they are just NOT LOUD ENOUGH. I found myself trying to turn the volume up louder every 2 seconds even tho it was all the way up. I like my headphones loud when I'm working out or doing a physical activity I love music and it keeps me going. However these earbuds are just not loud enough listening to moderately loud songs. If you come across music that hasn't been mastered super loud its practically unlistenable because its so quiet you can barely hear it. I didn't use them on the subway or even on a treadmill but I bet if I did this review would of been 1 star because it would have drove me even crazier.

the bad:
- Deal-breaker: cheap construction. the cheap, flimsy plastic earbud just broke rendering the entire unit useless
- when they did work, the earbuds are a bit bulky and unergonomic. they stick out of your ear way farther than they should, like bolts in Frankenstein's neck.

With light use in a battery saving mode, this battery could probably last me 5 to 6 days without recharging.  Very pleased on that front.

Because the battery is about 2.5 times the size of the stock battery, it ships with another back cover.  As another reviewer says, it actually makes the phone have a better fit in my hand.  The only things I find that could be improved upon are that the kickstand is completely inaccessible to me now.  If you have fingernails, this may not be the case for you, but I have difficulty.  Also, I notice that this backing ""sticks"" a bit more than the stock backing, in that the stock cover is much easier to remove.  I'm a power user, and find myself switching batteries occasionally, and I'm always nervous that I might break this cover while removing it from the phone.  It hasn't happened yet, and I doubt it will since it feels pretty solid, but there's a chance.

Also, the phone itself is having a hard time realizing it has more battery life now.

Twitter and Facebook constantly syncing, Gmail pushing notifications and me playing games (taxing games like GTA or Super Monkey Ball) with sound up to a high level.

After installation I mostly followed the instructions (up to 4 cycles, not the 5 it asked for) not that came with the battery but within about 5 hours I was down to 5% battery life again. I came here to complain originally but decided to wait out the 5 full charge and drain cycles. While doing so I searched the web about this battery and phone and found out that Motorola phones and a few others needed to be calibrated to show an accurate measure of battery life in the status bar. I tested this by turning on every radio leaving the screen on at max. Sure enough, my phone sat at 5% battery life for the remaining hours of the work day before it died.

I have not calibrated it yet, I will either update or comment on this review within a couple of days after I've successfully done so.

The battery itself starts off great and has a long life - I think a lot of the negative reviewers saying it had no effect just didn't recalibrate the battery meter.

Major thing making this a 3 star for me is the cheap crapy new back that is included/required. The reviews I read before purchase warned of this problem so I was careful in putting the new back on, and it was FANTASTIC nice and snug fitting! Unfortunately , less then a week after getting the Hyperion Battery my Photon 4g totally crashed (no surprise! Worst phone ever!!) I had to remove the battery to reboot the phone and now the cover will not go back on correctly! The bottom will not snap back in ! It is extremely frustrating! Now when I hold the phone there is a clicking noise as the bottom moves around!! I really hope that Hyperion/Amazon does something to remedy this situation. I am to the point now that I am going to go back to the lousy stock battery!
Also, I have tried all the tricks mentioned to have my non-rooted photon recognize the new larger battery but have not been able to accomplish it as of this time. Not a real problem though because I have been getting phone to last at full functionality for approximately 3 hours AFTER 5% battery warning! So no harm no foul!
Obviously, the fact you need the new back will render all of your cases for the photon useless and it does make the phone thicker and noticeably heavier. I personally like the ""new"" feel!

I learned that extended batteries sometimes lose ability to make good contact due to the contacts becoming loose.

Cons: you have to let your phone die 5-9 times before it manualy calibrates.
You may get inpatient waiting for it to die over and over and over.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005Z2Y39C,5.0,positive,"During the week, my stock battery would only last 6-7 hours before needing almost a full charge. Part of this maybe due to the fact that I work in a sound booth; my phone probably used a lot of power searching for 3G.

I bought this extended battery pack and on my 4th day am happy to say I have not had to charge my phone at all during the day (I charge overnight, everynight). I have not yet rooted my phone or found a battery monitor to account for the increase in battery capacity so my phone stays at 1% charge for a few hours. It has not yet shut down on me due to a complete drainage.

I am a heavy user checking email, some calls, Facebook, online apps, movies/music over wifi at home, and picture taking/video. I definitely recommend this product if you have a Motorola Photon.

Without the app the phone will only register 1650mAh, the amount of the original battery. So even when the phone says you have 0% you'll really have half the battery left. With judicious phone use this battery will easily last 2 days.

I also liked how the rubbery part of the surround added a bit of grip to my phone.  The stock iPhone 4/4S is way to slippery in my hands, which makes me nervous.

All the buttons line up well and work fine.  The rubber around the headphone jack doesn't work well with all 3.5 mm connectors, but I can live with that.

Unfortunately, this bumper just hasn't held up well over time.  After about 2 months, the rubber surround material started separating from hard plastic core of the bumper.  Additionally, the rubbery portion of the surround attracts grime like a magnet, and it seems hard to clean.

However, I also bought a Distronic TPU case, which is a more durable version of latex pretty much. After trying them both out, I am much more inclined to say that is a better product. It feels better, but additionally, it covers more of the phone. The Incipio case does not wrap around the entire top and bottom chrome portion of the device, leaving it open for damage in case of a fall. Also, it appears that the TPU product will do a better job of protection, as the impact of the fall will be distributed, rather than completely centralized at the point of impact by the Incipio product.

I give it three stars because I think it is a good value. However, I just don't think it's the best option to protect the phone. Just a personal preference, I suppose.",156,5

First of all, it is cute, but it is made of really cheap material. It is definitely not leather and it is very flimsy. However, I sort of expected that based on its price, so that isn't what bothered me.

What bothered me, and why I have to return it, is that the iPhone 4S camera does not work with this case. The hole cut for the camera is not large enough and all pictures have a pinkish hue because the red from the case gets in the way. I tried taking many pictures and it's all the same. There is no way to work around the fact that you will not be able to take a picture with your phone in this case.

I use the camera for different things, so I need a case that does not need to be removed for the camera to work. If you don't use the camera than this case is probably fine for you, but just know that it is a cheap case and it won't last forever.

2 problems though...
Unlike other flip cases which are designed in such a way that allows you to plug in the charger when the case is closed, this one DOES NOT.
The biggest problem with this case is that, when you take a flash photo, the red color of the case floods the photo with red color which makes it worthless if you use your camera in flash mode!  It ruins your photos.

The sleep button fell off a day after I got it; and the port where you plug your phone in to charge was too thick. When you plugged in the cord it would not charge because there was rubber in the way. Also, the plug to listed to headphones was also to thick, you would need a plug that went straight down.",82,2

The buttons and cutouts are exactly where they should be, and work fine. The bumper case allows you to protect the phone while still having a really slim profile. Not only does it protect the edges, but since it's a little wider than the phone, it lifts the face or back of the phone off of the surface they're on, protecting the rest of the phone at the same time. It's definitely worth spending a few bucks on",112,41

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,Apparently 'bumper' means trim for your phone.  The back and front of your iPhone are exposed while you have this 2 cent piece of plastic that lines the edges.  If you want a phone case that is going to actually protect your phone- don't buy this one.,47,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,got this for someone along with a Skinit sticker for an iphone and i loved the idea of it but was disappointed first because it took forever to receive it and then the blue was more of a purple so it didn't even match the Skinit that well. the charger also won't fit in the port with the case on so you have to take it off every time you charge your phone. it is a great idea and a great price but needs to be a little more ideal,90,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,the colors were great because it represented my team but the durability of the product itself wasn't too good. it already started falling apart. i would order another one but it's not worth the time and delievery. it was fun while it lasted,43,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,I was very excited to use this case and when I got it I was pleased. After about three weeks the silver buttons came off but it wasn't a big deal. It was worth the little bit of money I paid.,41,52

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,This case came quickly from hong kong or somewhere over there. Plus it was pretty cheap and does what its made to do for such a cheap case. its the same as an apple brand bumper but a fraction of the price,42,54

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,Well im not the type of guy to write reviews on anything nor do I feel as though what most people write are accurate but in this case it is. The photo makes the case appear to be a nice bright shinny orange and a dark glossy blue however in my case (no pun intended lol) it has a dull orange band and a vilot/pruple rubber edge. Knowing this I probially would have pasted on the case but what do you get for 2$? Also the sleep button is very sloppy and has to be in the correct postion to work or else another oart hold it down and it constantly tries to power down the iphone. Hope this helps,120,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,"Everyone always tells me that my phone looks 10x skinnier, and often get it confused with the iPhone 5. It's definitely a nice case, its well polished and looks exactly like the picture. The shipping was a bit slow, but I was patient and received it when expected so the company is very amazing to work with. The reason why its only about 2 stars less than a 5 is because the case rubber ended up coming off within 2 weeks after using it. I don't mind since I only paid $3, but overall it's an ok purchase. :)",99,67

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,"It does its job but it is very flimsy and isn't a true ""bumper case"". You can't charge your phone with one on due to the fact that it will keep popping out.",33,109

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,Im hard on bumpers and cases.  These are as good as the ones you get from Apple.  I dropped my phone and it landed on a metal corner of a door threshold right on the sleep button.  Put a nice ding right on it.  The case saved the day!!! but the silver plastic button part came off and now its hard to put the phone to sleep.  Ill order another cause they are soooo cheap in price!!  BTW they ship from China so it took about 2 weeks to get to Alabama.,92,113

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,"the colors are exactly as they appear online which is great. The bumper fits great. A huge plus for me is the the buttons are plastic and not the same rubber material as the bumper so it isn't difficult to press the buttons. It does prevent damage from minor falls. The only drawback is the charger won't plug in with it on, but the bumper is easy to take on and off so that isn't a big problem. I'd buy another one.",82,117

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,"This met our expectations.  It is exactly what we wanted. I am a bit concerned that it doesn't offer the protection an iphone needs, but it is exactly what we thought it would be.",34,130
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,The bumper is better than a thick phone cover however the blue is more of a purple then blue. I would recommend this to anyone.,25,131

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,"I was thrilled when I finally got this. I am a Gator fan and most colors are way off. This is perfect. Fits into my pocket with ease and I still feel like it's protected to a degree. And for the money, I'm thrilled!!",44,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,"This is a generic bumper for the iPhone 4s but unlike the products sold by Apple, the price tag is dramatically lower. Fits the 4s really well and the colors are as pictured.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,Very happy with my product it came when it said it would and it was very thing I expected! Will use again!,22,140
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,I received my product and it was in perfect condition! Love the iPhone 4/4s bumper. Only reason this isn't 3 stars is because I thought it was blue but it's more of a purple but that can't be blamed on seller it's computer discoloration. Thanks!,45,141
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,This product was worth me purchasing it makes my phone look the size it is other than the heavy ones you should get it,24,142

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,1.0,negative,"This product says it's orange and blue and it's not. It's orange and purple!! I hate it and would not recommend it to anyone.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,"I was SOO excited to get this. It took sooo long to ship. And when I got it, it wasn't really what I was expecting. Its not blue and orange...its more of a purple and orange. And the ""Blue"" part of it started peeling a couple days after I got it. Also the way it fits the phone, if you have a screen cover/back cover, it kinda peels that off also. Not a big fan of this Bumper.",78,147
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,Bumper was not blue and orange. The part that was supposed to be blue was more of a purple. This is annoying because I got it to support the Gators.,30,148
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,My bf liked it a lot. Was very happy that I got it and it came quick And right in time,21,149
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,"pretty neat
does not become loose over time it goes well with the iphone

i have a white one and it looks better on the white then the black",33,150
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,"Physically there is nothing wrong with this item.  However, it claimed to be Orange & Blue... it's not!  It is Orange & Purple.  It is less than $3, so it's not like it was a big waste of money, but I would not have purchased it.",46,151
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,Great little thing fun to buy a bunch and switch them out every couple of weeks. I received them earlier than expected and will continue to buy them,28,152
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,"I bought this case specifically because the title said ""Orange and blue"". I went to Auburn so I like sporting my alumni colors. However in reality I'd say it's purple, not blue. So now I have a phone case that looks more like it supports Clemson than Auburn. While some people may think this is no big deal, I'm a little annoyed because that's specifically why I bought it - I wanted blue.

The case itself is a great case, built well. I would recommend a bumper case to anyone, but I wouldn't recommend this one to my friends who want blue & orange, since it is purple & orange instead.",111,153
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,"The original item description said orange and blue, but the item was actually orange and purple. I'm a huge Gator fan, and was looking forward to orange and blue case, but even still it is a great case.",38,154
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,Good bumper case with excellent fit and finish.  Protects as well as can be expected and looks exactly like the product that is advertised.,24,155
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,I just recived this product about a week ago. Although I ordered a blue and orange case i recived a case which is very much purple and orange. But it is still a nice case I have recieve many compliments on it.,42,156
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,4.0,positive,I was a little skeptical when purchasing this case because the last bumper I bought did not fit the Verizon 4S. This case fits perfectly. The only thing that was different is the colors. The orange is lighter and so is the blue. It doesn't look bad. It's just not the same as the picture.,55,157
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,"I got this knowing it was a ripoff of the original Apple bumper but I liked the colors. I'm a University of Virginia fan so the dark blue and orange would look great on my white iPhone 4S. When I got the bumper I was immediately disappointed because what I thought was royal blue is a light, sky blue.

When I took it out of the case I was further let down because the edges were very sharp and not smooth. The outer color is a rubber like material and the inner ""ring"" is hard plastic. The plastic had rough edges that made it annoying to hold. This was also the issue in the corners where the injection mold came together. I got out my wife's fingernail file and smoothed everything down. It is much more pleasant to hold now.

The area around the headphone jack is a bit too thick. I really have to mash the headphone plug down to get it to stay in, or I just remove the bumper. The bottom piece is recessed enough so this isn't an issue with the charger port.

If it was any more than the $3 I paid I would have to give it one star. Since it was only $3 and the official Apple ones are $30, I didn't mind sanding the edges down a little bit. I will say the major reason I only give it three stars is because the colors in the picture are misleading.",248,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,5.0,positive,it is a great cases and really fast service. it is the coolest phone cases i had ever seen. Thanks,20,159

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,2.0,negative,The on off button could not raise back up and did not work. I have to tape a piece of cardboard under the case for it to work.,28,162
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006G3C8SW,3.0,neutral,"My son wanted these colors because University of FL are these colors. It works fine but it is only the sides, it does not cover the front. I wish it did and I think my son does too.",38,163
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"I had many SPECK cases, I love them all, they are the best cases made for iPhone!!
About this case, it's new nice style, nice finishing, provide good protection ..
The ON/OFF button hard to press, but it's not a major issue for me.
I'm happy with this case.

### Update Aug 29th 2012 ###

After 7 months using, the sides started to peel-off!!
Consider that I have other cases I switch between..
So I had this case for a 7 months but use it occasionally.

It seems to me the new ""SPECK""'s cases are low quality, I had many of there cases but the last 3 models were bad quality.",111,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"Goes right on the phone, and protects it.  Does the job, and the quality is AMAZING. My friend thought it was a $60-70 case.

Amazing buy, trust me! :)",29,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,My son really wanted this.  Gave it to him for Christmas and by that night it was already starting to rip (the material away from the plastic case).  My husband glued it ... hopefully it will last a little longer!!,40,2

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"This case is poorly constructed.  The matte coating on it quickly started peeling off the case, revealing a shiny layer below.  Unfortunately, the peeling wasn't uniform, leaving the case looking like it was peeling skin after a bad sunburn.  The cloth layer on it quickly attracts dirt as well.  The worst thing about this case is that it also broke after dropping it just once.  Don't buy this case, unless your goal is to look like a ragamuffin.",78,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,Horrible. It fell apart after a month of having it. The fabric started peeling away from the case and was gross.,21,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,Great for protecting iPhone but the fabric pieces get frayed around the edges and peel back easily. My daughter carries it in her pocket everywhere.,25,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"This case has worked very well for me. Unlike the CandyShell, the FabShell has a sturdy bumper, especially by the adapter. I was displeased, however, when the fabric came off. It is almost as if the glue melted and just would not hold on after that. It was in my pocket, so it wasn't as if I left it in extreme heat. I repainted the outside and my phone is still well protected.",73,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"The digital pattern is really cool and different, but the panels are made of fabric. This attribute is really nice at first, but the adhesive wears off after a while causing the panels to fall off.",36,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"This was super cute at first. It fit great, wasn't too bulky, wasn't too thin.  But then the fabric started peeling off the side.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,I bought this for my son..he absolutely loved it and I loved the price.  I will recommend my friends buy this product.,22,13
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"The reason I only gave this product 3 stars is because the power button is very difficult to push. The cover is cute, and it does feel like my phone is well protected with this case on. But the power button issue was enough for me to find a different case. I use the power button too much to have so much difficulty to push it.",66,14
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"My daughter bought one and it fell apart (I wrote to the company, no answer).
Mine lasted 6 months before the bumper edge started coming away around

Won't buy a Speck product again. They last less than 6 months.",44,15
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"Nice case! Fits well, easy on and off. Great colors and nice feel in your hand. I highly recommend it.",20,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"This case fits my iPhone 4S perfectly well and looks great too. The buttons (volume and screen-off) take a little breaking-into as they are stiff when you first get them, but this occurs relatively quickly. The case is a tight-fit so there is no fear of it falling off. However, this makes it a little hard to get off. As far as protection quality goes, its probably not the most ideal case but it does the job for the most part. It looks great and I'm pretty careful with my phone so this case worked perfectly for me.",98,17
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"The product I purchased was labelled as 'Like New', and I received it quickly enough, but the package was extremely dirty, and quite obviously stuffed back into the packaging it came in (which was taped up with clear scotch tape). The case itself was in poor shape. The fabric that the design was on was beginning to come off on the bottom and back, and after a couple weeks of continued use, eventually fell off completely. I tried super gluing it, but it just looked awful.

Loved the case, wish it was the quality I paid for.",97,18
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,My husband picked this out for me because it offers great protection for my phone (his must) and looks cute (my must).  I loved it!  That is until the fabric started peeling off of the sides within a week of putting it on my phone.  I tried gluing it back on....which I shouldn't have to do....but that didn't last.  Sadly shopping for a new case...,65,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"I originally purchased this case at a Best Buy. It worked fine for about 3 months. Then the fabric sticker on the side of the case began peeling off. I had to PULL TEETH to get Speck to replace the case with a new one. 3 months later - same issue. They said that this type of problem is from different lotions on my hands, or environmental issues like humidity. I'm a guy. I don't use hand lotions. I live in Southern California - it's warm and dry.

Speck fails to recognize that they've put out a SUB-STANDARD product to their consumer base. This case is not worth your time. The fabric sticker will start to peel with normal use. It's cheaply made JUNK.

Oh, and for all my troubles with them - they offered me a 20% discount on another JUNK case they make. No thanks Speck. I will NEVER buy another of your products again and I hope consumers at Amazon read this and see how poor quality their products are.",173,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"I'm not sure what all these negative reviews are about, I think they're just not sure how to put on a phone case. I've heard that the case is too tight and hard to get off? Well it is tight on your phone, but isn't that what you want? I've heard it's too big and the phone slides around, but it fits my iPhone 4s perfectly. All my cords fit fine, and there's plenty of room, even for my aux jack in my car. The volume buttons and off button are kind of hard to use AT FIRST, but I got used to it within a day of using it and now I don't even notice. So far the fabric is clean and not frayed or anything, but I assume over time it'll get dirty, no big deal though, it's what to expect with fabric. If you're really annoyed by that possibility then just get some spray that people put on shoes or something and that should help, or just get a phone case that isn't made of fabric. I would probably suggest buying a new one rather than a used one if you want it to look perfect and not dirty or damaged. If you don't really care and just want protection I'd say go for whatever you want! Love this case, the colors are awesome!",227,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"Bought this case for the wife's iPhone 4S after seeing it in the apple Store in NY. Shipping was prompt from Amazon as usual. The case fits very well, with the volume mute button easily accessible. However 2 weeks ago, the coloured fabric has started to strip from one of the sides requiring me to glue it back on. Not acceptable. I am not sure if I got a bad one .. but I took off 3 stars as a result.",81,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"This is my 3d iPhone and about my 6th Speck case. I love the Speck FabShell Fabric Hard Shell cases. They have fun colors and designs plus they really protect the phone. I've accidentally dropped my phone face down outside on the pavement. I picked it up - no damage to the phone. None at all. The case is secure and wraps all the way around with a raised beveled edge around the screen. The cut-outs are large enough not to cause problems (especially on the camera cut-out) while still protecting the camera lens and the plugs. I've never had a problem with the press-thru buttons for the volume and on buttons. I click the up volume and the volume instantly gets louder. When the fabric starts to show some dirt, I simply remove the phone, then use a mild soap to wash it. Let it dry completely and it looks brand new. The only reason I've bought so many is I like to switch it up once in a while with a new color/pattern. But I always get another Speck and am a loyal Speck iPhone case user.",189,23

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,No because as soon as I started to use the case the fabric began to peel off. There needs to be a better design.,24,25
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"First of all this case is very protective I've dropped my phone multiple times and it's fine, although the fabric gets discolored and stained, and starts pealing of the base of the case after like 2 weeks it's a big let down because now I have to purchase a new case because this looks terrible",55,26
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,While this is a very attractive case and very protective the fabric on the outside does get dull and in some places comes unglued.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,This case lasted about 3 months before it took a free ride to the landfill. The stripes are a glued on fabric that starts to peel off with normal use of the phone. Save your money and buy something else.,40,29

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"I really liked the look of this product and when I got it, it was perfect. But within a week, it was already tearing on the sides and just doesn't last at all.",33,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"To start off with, I have a tendency of taking most reviews with a grain of salt.  The whole ""OMG this is great, bla bla"" or ""WTF da suq"" is what many reviews end up being.  I decided to give this a shot because it was right in the middle and I really liked the pixelated look on of the sides and back.

I could not have been more wrong.

The first one I ordered, had the fabric coming unglued at the bottom of the case near where the 30 pin connector would go within a week of getting it.  I contacted Amazon and they generously sent me out another.  I thought I might have been a fluke, mail back the original and used the new.

Fast forward a week and half after it is out of return status from Amazon and it's doing the same exact thing again.

I tried to contact Specks for help, but never got a response, I left a message on their voicemail system but to no avail, and the company is absolutely worthless with their online chat.

What ever you do, don't get this case.  You will end up regretting it later on down the road.",202,32
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"This case is nice for awhile.  After about 6 months, the fabric started to separate from the plastic.  This wasn't too big of a deal since by then it was all wore out and needed to be replaced anyways.",39,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"Took something like 6 months of use, but the fabric eventually started peeling away off of the case. The fabric will also get dirty, you'll have to clean it. I wasn't fond of the ""lip"" around the front, makes it difficult to swipe all the way sometimes. I still liked the case though, and would still recommend.",57,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"We bought two of these. The first one we bought, the fabric material started coming off about a month into getting it. We thought we got a bad one. So we ordered another one. It took a couple of months but the material started coming off again. The residue is so sticky, it makes it very uncomfortable to use without the fabric.  Will not buy again.",66,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"great case, was looking for a case that didn't double the size of my phone all together. only reason that i didn't give it 5 stars is that it is difficult to get off.",34,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"On a whim I had picked up one of Speck's other fabric shells some time ago and I loved it.  Colorful, durable, but after a while the glue used to fasten the fabric to the plastic shell started coming undone.  So I came to Amazon to find a replacement.

The SPK-A1009 I received was put together poorly.  The fabric pieces had not been lined up properly on the plastic shell and so the fabric sticks out over the lip along the bottom of the case.  Also the fabric piece that runs the along the side with the volume buttons is somewhat frayed toward the bottom.  I fear this case won't last half as long as the original I picked up.",120,37
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"I had previously ordered a SPECK iphone 4s case and really liked the quality of the case and the protection it offered, and so I thought to order a different color scheme. When i came across this pixelated looking print I thought it would be a great purchase- different from what others might have. When it arrived, i was immediately disappointed. The printed material on the back is essentially a glued on piece of fabric, which showed signs of peeling already when I received it. Needless to say, the fabric began peeling off from the corners soon after. Definitely cheaply made and would not recommend this to others.",108,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,I love the FabShell Fabric Hard Shell Speck Case is a fabulous product. It's very protective and it's the perfect pattern! I hightly recommend it!,25,39
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"Do NOT buy this case.  While it does provide protection, it frays at the edges quickly after you begin using it.",21,40
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,I bought this cover and it lasted me about a month. I'm a medicine student so it's not like my phone was exposed to harsh conditions. The speck letters completely came off and the two lateral sides. These fabric hard cases look nice but they won't last long.,48,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"I've owned two of these cases now. They're very attractive, They protect the phone. But the quality is pretty awful. The first one fell apart in 6 months. The second one had the fabric separating from the case in 3 months. The holes in the second case also didn't match up with the ports on the phone.

Really, this case looks nice, but the quality is awful.",67,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,I love the fit and protection as well as the fun design. The cons are the difficulty getting the case off when needed and the fabric on the case is fraying and coming unglued from the side. I would not choose the fabric version in the future. Otherwise great case!,50,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,Bought my Fiance this case less than 2 months ago.  The cloth comes apart and frays very easily.  The glue used seems to be weak and wear out causing the cloth to seperate from the plastic portion of the case.  For the money should last a bit longer.,48,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"I purchased this case and after using for about 3 months it started to tear at the edges.  The fabric is not glued on well enough.  I sent it back to Speck since there is a year warranty, but because I purchased from an 'illegal' seller Fangfang He on Amazon who apparently was selling counterfeit cases I don't get a replacement case from Speck.  It was pretty disappointing.  Only buy directly from Speck!",73,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"I get compliments on this case all the time.  The design is solid, and my iPhone remains in perfect condition after a few drops.  However, after 2 months the cloth became very dirty and faded.  Now the cloth is coming unglued from the case.",44,46

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"I originally had the candy shell case and I loved it!!  I had it for a few months before I dropped it and broke the bottom.  I loved the colors on this case so I thought I would give it a shot.  Within 3 days of use, the fabric had started to fray on the bottom corners.  I have had it a month now and the fabric has frayed on each edge of the phone now.  I have tried glue and clear fingernail polish and it just looks tacky so I am now going to trash it and buy another candy shell one.",103,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"The case is excellent, I dropped my phone on concrete, face down, and not a scratch on it. Unfortunately the fabric started peeling fairly soon after purchase, just superglued it back down. Also, the fabric gets dirty, not easy to clean. I like the color and pattern, but too hard to care for.",53,49
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"The  fabric covering the plastic started peeling off after 2 days. Had to discard the item, it's useless. Would not recommend.",21,50
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"This is a great little case, fits well, nice colors. I like the protection, I've dropped my iPhone 4 several times with nary a scratch. However, be warned that the color areas are done in a thin cloth which picks up dirt, dust, coffee etc. and within a week the colors are already stained and faded. Washing with a cloth does not seem to help. I love this case but had not expected the colors to be damageable cloth.

UPDATE 11/13/12: I've had this case for a few months now and it continues to provide good protection, but the colors have become so dirty and stained just by normal use that it now looks grimy and disgusting and I'm going to have to buy another.  I will NOT be buying one with a cloth covering.",135,51
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"This case is really beautiful.  I love the colors & it fits the phone perfectly.  However, some of the edges of the fabric started to fray almost immediately as some other people shared.  However, I don't think that its really that noticeable as long as it doesn't continue to get worse.  Its a unique case and I would still recommend it.  Seller promptly sent the item and it arrived exactly as described.",72,52
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"When I ordered this case I was worried it would be cheap or break easily. It arrived and I was happily surprised to see that: A. It was just as cute as it looked online, B. It seemed durable, and C. it fit my phone (iphone 4, not 4s)perfectly. I was happy for a few months with this product, until I tried to dock it.

The bottom of this case is really thick so the only way to dock the phone on an iHome or any similar device, is to remove it from the case. This would not be a big deal except that the case is a PAIN to take on and off. I really thought I was going to snap my phone in half the first time I tried to take the case off. I am hunting around again for a different case because I need to take this one off at least twice a day and its just not worth it.",164,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"Compared to other SPECK cases, I am more comfortable with this ""one piece"" design. Previously I had a ""two piece"" SPECK case and it lasted for one or two drops (depending on impact) before a corner broke apart, leaving the case useless (which is better than a broken screen, IMO).

I've had this for a month or so, and have no issues with the fit of the case. The bottom fit is a little loose, but my phone doesn't slide around in the case, only the bottom lip have a little bit of give. All in all, for the price this is good and has met my expectations.",108,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"I bought this case because 1. it looks really nice and I love the colors and 2. I heard Speck was a good brand.  Even though I liked the case, I returned it since I wasn't able to use my AUX cord in my car to play music. If you have a standard AUX cord, it will not plug in the whole way.  That was a deal breaker for me.  Also, the material is like a fabric so the white part would have gotten dingy quickly.",86,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,2.0,negative,"I purchased this product and after about a week on the phone, the side striping started to peel off.  I am not a hard user of my phone, so the reason this occurred is not because of misuse.  I contacted Speck to see if I could take advantage of the warranty since it has started to deteriorate, but they have informed me that they don't recognize this retailer and that they won't honor any warranty because it is not an authorized retailer.  I'm not out of the money it cost and I won't buy from this person again.  Speck suggested this may be a 'fake' case since it has fallen apart so quickly.",113,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,3.0,neutral,"This is a really stiff case. Which is great for protect the phone and looking good. However if say you want to switch the case or trying to use a headphone that can't into the jack because of the case, then you'll run into difficulty trying to take it off.",50,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,Received this case in dirty condition. It wa brand new but very poorly made. Fits terrible. I'll never buy a speck product again,23,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"Fit perfectly, sturdy and seems to provide a great degree of protection. Allows the use of back camera and can be changed in a snap.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"I was so excited to receive this product. The colors
look exactly like the photo and the case is very hard
and offers excellent protection. One minor thing to add
is that its a little difficult to remove at times.
I know some people are saying it gets dirty quickly and
this is true. When my case first got dirty, i put it inside
a pair of gym short pockets dropped it in the washer on delicate
looked brand new! Let it air dry.",84,60

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"I LOVE this case!  I get asked about it almost every time I use my phone.  It isn't too bulky, yet seems to protect the phone just fine (although I haven't dropped it).  At first I wasn't pleased because it seemed to get dirty quickly, but a Tide stain sick took out the stains and then I Scotchguarded it.  I haven't had any other problems!",65,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"Speck usually makes great cases, but this one was an absolute piece of garbage.

-It offers no protection, which is what I expected (and so should you with any case this low profile) but still something to note.

-The fabric is CHEAP and was poorly attached, was already coming off right out of the packaging.

-The case doesn't even fit the phone correctly and there was a large amount of room for the phone to slide back and forth... unacceptable.

I had this case on my phone for maybe 2 hours before printing the return shipping labels, please do not waste your time, money, or energy with this awful product.",110,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"I bought this case almost 15 days ago and now I have the bottom part broken; is material but is unglueing it self. Hate this case and ""Speck"" mark",29,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,5.0,positive,"I was a little hesitant to buy this with some of the reviews but I found a solution for the problem.  A lot of people complain about how this case gets dirty really fast.  My sister works for payless and they sell this spray that helps protect your shoes from dirt and mud, so I decided I would spray that on the case before I used it and it has worked really well!! After about 3 weeks I had a few small smudges, so I cleaned them off and resprayed the case and now it's back to repelling dirt again.  So just reapply every few weeks to keep it clean!

It is a little hard to get your phone out of the case, so if you change the case a lot you will be frustrated with this one.",138,65

Still love it, though!",49,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,1.0,negative,"All the other reviews led me to buy this case, but it doesn't even fit my iPhone 4 right. The sides are to wide on the lower half, so my iPhone has room to slide around. All though this case has style, I'm dissatisfied, and i wouldn't recommend this case. I looked at the packaging more closely, and it was in a fabshell burton packaging (and this case sing in the burton category). The packaging was already taped and ripped. This is probably counterfeit or already returned.",87,67

I have dropped my phone twice and this case protected it so well that there is not even a scratch on my phone. It's nice because it's a sturdy hard plastic material. The blue bars of color are fun too! Overall great purchase. It's definitely worth the investment!

The only thing I don't like about this case is that the buttons over the hold button and the volume buttons are sort of hard to press. Aside from that, it's an awesome case!",104,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006GK5BUW,4.0,positive,"I orginally wanted the Burton Fabshell, but did not find any on amazon, so I bought this one instead. Love the color scheme of this case and the feeling of it. Like many people say, this case is sort of like a combination of the candyshell and speck fitted case. I own the candyshell case, but found it sometimes too bluky when I put it in my jean pocket. I also didn't like that the fitted cases didn't cover the volume and sleep buttons. So I find that th fabshell cases are a perfect mix between those two cases.  It's not bulky and it has the design of the fitted case.

However some cons includes: the cloth may get dirty over time depending on your lifestyle of course (for me I use my phone all the time, I bring it everywhere - the gym, park, etc) Also I feel like the bottom part of the  case below the home button may eventually begin to sag -depending on how you treat your case. I've been using this case for a little over a month now and it's still in good shape. I also found that the sleep button takes a bit of pressure to press with the case on.",208,71

The color is not as bright as the picture but a more subtle mauve. It's not a great protector case if you ever drop it from the front however because there is absolutely no coverage of your screen. HOWEVER it makes up for all that in look. It's super cute and i would recommend it to anyone looking for something iconic yet different. :3,81,95

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,3.0,neutral,"It took long to come, which I expected. Yet when I recieved the case it was silicone! It was supposed to be a hard case.

It does not look like the photo, it looks like the boy stitch, just pink no lashes no different color nose, nothing. It's very bulky also, I couldn't deal with it and had to take it off after 2 days.",92,104

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,2.0,negative,"This product was so cute to look at. I was so excited that the price was affordable and what not. However the material it was made in is VERY unforgiving to any fall or mishap. I dropped it once ,at a small distance, and it shattered completely. It also was very bulky and much larger than expected in the picture. So basically it's cute, cheap and unique. On the flip side though the flaws in functionality do not compensate for the positive aspects.",83,110

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,"It was really cute when I got it, it's the first iphone case that I got for myself. No technical problems at all, except that the colors of the ears were not tan, they were actually the same color as the body itself. The nose was not purple, but red. The toes got dirty really easily, and some of the material on the toes got scrapped off. As long as you don't drop it, it should last for awhile. In case you do drop it, its okay. I dropped mine after 2 weeks, it sliced open and all the buttons on the side popped off. BUT, i was able to fix it easily by putting in back the buttons and just super gluing the sides back together.  People say its big, but its actually not, it fits my back pocket just perfect with its head peeking out. I give this item an overall 4 because although its not exactly like the picture, its close,  cheap, cute, and very fixable. What i do recommended if you get this item is to keep the ears closed at most times. Not only do keeping the ears in will keep your screen untouched from a table's surface but it will keep it from breaking.",210,152

Also, the ears come hidden so you get to push a button on the top of the head to ""pop"" the ears out to their shown position.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006NMV59E,4.0,positive,"WARNING: it is NOT the same stitch as shown in the picture. If you look at the other pink stitches sold by other Amazon sellers, that's what it looks like, Ears are pink, there is no purple heart nose. I chose this one because it looked different from the rest, but guess not.

BESIDES THAT, it's ADORABLE STILL, of course. It came in 4 weeks. I wish it would've come sooner, but they it's from China (airmail), so I can't be too stingy there. I bought a used one, and it doesn't look used at all (unlike the Blue stitch i ordered) Hopefully the ears won't break like my blue one did as well. It didn't come in a nice packaged box, but it wasn't broken, there was no damage. It just came in a plastic seal with a screen protector :) The nose is beautiful velvet red and it's sweet and feminine. The buttons match fine with my Iphone 4S. You have to take the head off to turn it on silent which I personally don't give a shist about. I'd recommend it, just keep in mind it's not the one shown in the picture. that is all. Over and Out :)
Another thing is that when the ears are in, it covers up a bit of the top of the screen..it gets annoying..you'll have to deal with it.
Ear phone jack and charger jack, once its in it's hard to take out (if you're paranoid about breaking something)...same goes with the case..it won't come off ;/ (strange)",259,240

It's still a cute case, but not as cute as it could be. With the vibration button being on the side of the phone, it is hard to keep my phone on ring because when putting on her head, the button pushes down and puts the phone on vibrate.

At first I was very pleased with it, but three months down the road I am very disappointed.  The ridges on the rotating part of the clip have worn down making the clip loose, spinning upside down easily while wearing on your belt and potentially dumping the phone out.  Then the other day the clip broke right off.

So I thought I should contact Mophie for warranty.  No response after one week filing a warranty request on their website!  Why can't someone make a holster for a ""fat"" iPhone which will last?  I had one for my old blackberry that outlasted the phone!",144,5

I had blackberry cases for many years on my hip without a single issue like this .  I wish I could find a blackberry case  that would fit the mophie.  The other problem I had was the phone and case combo was heavy enough to pull the phone off your hip unless it is on your belt.  Clipping it to your pocket on khakis would fall off 100% of the time.

---UPDATE 1-23-2013---
So, as others have suggested, the clip finally broke. To the case's credit, I clipped to my belt on my left hip, which I only do during the winter when playing tuba at MSU (sorry for the digression, but the sousaphone rests on the right hip, hence the change), and it snagged on the car door pillar as I hurried out of the car when I was late to play the basketball gig. This happens practically once every winter, as I normally wear my cases on my right hip to prevent this from occurring. Well, I figured I was out $30. But, the next weekend, the Mophie battery itself broke; the USB charging port broke off inside the case. I contacted Mophie and received a RMA number for the battery and returned it to them under warranty. I placed the battery inside the broken case with a post-it note that the case clip was broken the same weekend. Even though the case was not part of my warranty claim, when I received the replacement battery, the good people at Mophie replaced the case, too! Now that's what I call customer service.",215,36

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B006QYY88E,1.0,negative,"I ordered the Mophie Hip Holster to allow me to store my iPhone 4S on the left side of my belt. I don't like storing bulky things, especially cell phones in my pockets. After receiving this case in the mail, I observed that the leather portion of the case was well designed and of high quality, but the construction of the clip was very poor. For the size of the case, I expected that the clip would be made bigger to handle all of the torque and stress an end user would normally exert on it. This past Saturday after opening my car and sitting down the leather portion of the case separated from the plastic clip.

As mentioned the plastic clip should be made larger to handle all the torque and stress the end user would normally exert on it. Perhaps the plastic clip could be made out of aluminum or other high quality metal. When my case broke some small plastic pieces connecting the plastic clip to the leather case fell off and I have no idea where they went. So there is no way I could glue them together.

The reason I gave this product 1 star is because I can no longer clip the case to my belt. If the case was usable, I would probably give a 4 or 5 star rating.

Pros:
- It's cheap
- My wife likes the pink accent without it looking like an all-pink Barbie phone
- It's relatively sturdy for the price

Cons:
- The rubber shell doesn't attach quite as securely as the Defender; it's not a big deal but you just have to keep an eye on it
- The side buttons aren't raised (although they are marked with a small groove; coming from the Defender or the Seidio case on my phone, you kind of fumble looking for the buttons
- The rubber started to tear around the headphone jack and USB port flaps right away; I cut away the protective flaps (the case isn't at-all waterproof anyway) and it hasn't gotten worse
- The OEM USB cord was a little too wide to fit into the charging plug, although other USB cables fit fine; I took a file to the plastic around the USB port and in a few minutes the OEM cord fit fine too

I took it out of the case and took a picture in the same setting and the colors were fine. So I stopped using this case and bought something else. If you aren't big on taking pictures than this case should be fine for you, especially for the price. I have only used it a couple of days before I discovered the issue with the camera so I am not sure how truly durable this case is.

The ports are covered, which I still really like. The charging port rubber cover ripped off and now the case does not fit correctly at the bottom. A little sunscreen on my face also discolored the pink hard plastic (not to mention leaving pink lines on my face when I used the phone.)
The case fits the phone properly and wasn't difficult to install. I haven't dropped it, but I am sure the case would fully protect my phone. The discomfort and bulk of this case makes it not worth keeping any longer. Buying a new one today.",126,64

They're a bit bulky and took an already large phone to not being able to fit in jeans pockets comfortably. The rubber shell fits loosely around the hard plastic inner shell and one drop from chest high caused the case to crack. At least it wasn't my phone.

The back had slits on the back to show the pink hard shell through the black rubber part(which i didn't mind) But there were no flaps over the ports which is the reason I got the case to begin with. I contacted the seller and they emailed me back the next day turns out they were out of the the picture shows.  They asked if I would like to choose another that had the flaps and I choose a different one so I  picked one in a different color that had the flaps and I was fine with the. The only thing is that I wish they would of had something that said that that one was out and it wouldn'thave been an issue.,159,95

Each area can have the silicone part lifted up for easy access. the black part is a ribbed lining that is put inside the pink hard case. Because of this it doesn't fit true to size, However it works and is just a little slacked. It can also fit with the extended battery/Case backing for those who have it.

The adapter plug seems to fit a little loosely in the Verizon 4510L unit, so it might not be getting a great connection.  From what I've read, this antenna is intended to be used with a ground plane, i.e. mounted on top of a horizontal sheet of metal that is at least 8 inches in diameter with the antenna in the center.

Out of desperation I decided to try this antenna, and it has changed my life!  Immediately the mifi started picking up and transmitting 4G signal, and was downloading at a speed of up to 5.5 mbps (remember, I live in the country!) which I found amazing.

Surprisingly, it is not much heavier than the original either. I am in the process of calibrating it (trying to complete multiple charge cycles), but I have noticed an increase in battery life already.

On a side note, I couldn't be happier with the seller.

Right out of the box the battery is a bit heavier that the OEM batteries that I have (which I consider a good sign), it's not going to make the phone significantly heavier or anything, but the added weight in my book means that there is evidence that this battery really does have more juice in it.

I fallow direction from vendor and the first week I was happy and impress, the second week I was kind of wondering what happen with the 2300 mAh at the third week i gave up, the battery never gave me more hours or power to say it is a 20-30% more life time.
The reason I gave one star is because after I complain to the vendor, they without a question send me a credit.

So as it was on a normal day without my kids playing games,  I was lucky to keep a charge beyond 4:00 pm...  it was to a point where if I could plug in a charger and use it, I did.

I was considering getting a larger battery that would require a new case, adding bulk to my phone, however I'm glad I went with this one.  Under the same conditions as before, and with a properly conditioned battery,  I'm able to maintain a working charge well after I'm on my way home, 6:30 PM in most cases.  When I get home, I usually have 10% or so left.  By the time I go to bed, 10:00ish, the phone is pretty much done, assuming a don't use it much after I'm home.  But the combination of properly conditioning the battery and the extended life are just about perfect for my needs during the week.  On weekends when I hand off the phone to the kids or with heavy use, I need to put it on a charger around 2 PM to get throught the day.

The case its self has a nice colour to it and looks good with the black HTC Raider / Vivid phone, but it feels cheap upon touching it. However, once you've gotten the case onto the phone, you sometimes have to fight with it to get it off, and one of ours cracked when attempting to take it off. I wouldn't recommend this product but I'm not discouraging you from buying it either- it is a case that will offer protection to your phone, but in a very limited say.

The good- it's hard and does not flop off. If you really hate that the rubberized cute ones fall off, but you just want the image of a cassette without your phone being morphed into one, you can buy this case.

Doesn't matter since the 4/4s are the same size so it should have fit but one side just didn't reach all the way around to latch on my phone completely. I won't bother returning it since its a cheap case anyways and Id most-likely have to pay for shipping. The picture of the cassette wasn't all that great either but I expected that. Oh well.

The height of these are only 156mm which is also still too short for a 16:9 AR 10"" tablet, but not as bad as the width is.  I also don't think these are for 4:3 aspect ratio tablets, but since I don't have any 4:3 tablets I CANNOT be sure of that.  Looks like they may be made for some oddball aspect ratio.  All you can do is measure your tablet's screen then see if these dimensions will work well for it.  Again, these are 228mm x 156mm.  If you don't care that part of your screen is unprotected, then they ""will fit on"" a 10"" 16:9 tablet but not without exposed unprotected edges on all 4 sides.",194,22

I own 5 tablets, and several phones that I have put screen protectors like this one, so this is not my first rodeo.  I have never had one that was just impossible to successfully install until now.  Maybe there is some special trick to installing this one?  I will never know because they included ZERO product description or instructions.  As others have noted, it's hard to even tell which side to apply.  I thought maybe I had just made a mistake with the first attempt, so was super careful with the second, but still didn't work.

Other than that, the case does protect my phone and its durable.",99,31
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,4.0,positive,"This is a well-made leather case, which fits the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx fairly well.  The case cover is thick leather with a lining, which makes the flap stick out a bit when closed. There are slots at the bottom which makes it easy to remove the phone by pushing up with a finger.  The belt clip is detachable, and has a hook on the end to prevent it from slipping off your belt - a feature that is essential.  However, with enough pressure, as when getting into a car seat, the clip will detach, but it's easy to reinsert it.  There is another flap clip with a snap, but this is upside down and will come unsnapped with used on a belt.
Now a warning about the magnetic clasp.  The Razr Maxx has a well-known problem with the magnetic sensor, which is used for the compass function. If the phone is exposed to a strong magnet, the sensor can become frozen and the compass will not work.  This happened to me with this case, and also to my partner, who has the same phone.  It's easy enough to unstick it - Google it.  But to prevent it from happening, I pried out the magnet with a screwdriver.  It comes out easily with no damage to the case.  I replaced the magnetic clasp with a couple of pieces of Velcro, and I'm very happy with the result.",237,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,2.0,negative,"This case was nice and constructed well, but it has two real bad design flaws.  First, when I tried to wear it with my slacks and no belt I immediately saw that the plastic clip was set way too low on the back of the case.  This as the effect of letting the case and my phone sag away from my body and stick out at about a 60 degree angle.  The case was always getting bumped and snagged on everything.  When I tried wearing it with jeans and a belt, just using the leather belt snap, it rode on my belt like it should, fairly snug against my waist.  I thought that I could at least wear it that way, but the snaps are way too weak and it would come unsnapped when I was getting out of my car.  I wound up giving it to a coworker who has the same phone, but I don't think he likes it either.  It is still sitting on his desk and he is not using it.",175,1

Now with this being said, the magnetic button that hold the case closed ripped out in two months! Had this had a flat magnet design this wouldn't of happened. Now I need to go out and buy another one. I guess you get what you pay for..but good only for a couple of months..really?!",70,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,"The case design is perfect.  The open slot on the bottom of the case makes sure that the on/off button does not get pressed while in the case.  I had a solid case before and wondered why my battery was not lasting very long, the phone was turning on while in the case.  It will not happen in this case when the phone is placed in it correctly.  The magnetic catch is strong enough for normal use.  I added a piece of self-adhesive velcro to the flap to make sure it stays closed, but I have to admit, I am rough on cell phones and cases.  I do like the way it hooks on your belt, the extra piece that snaps is very secure.  Absolutely no way for it to slip off of your belt.  Again, best design that I have found for the Motorola Razr Maxx.  Also shipping was very prompt. Purchased from Cell-Stuff thru Amazon.",157,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B0079QGHNC,5.0,positive,"This case fits the Droid RaxrMaxx HD perfectly.  The magnetic clasp on the flap is nice and strong.  What I like most about this case is the belt clip and belt strap arrangement.  First, the belt clip has a bottom hook to hook under your belt to keep the case from coming off the belt.  Next, there are two snap straps that come around the belt in the opposite direction.  Your belt is totally captured by this case and it's impossible for the case to come off your belt.  Great value.  I had one of these for a long time and it lasted nicely.  Time to refresh so I got another.",111,6

I am not running any more apps than what I did on my HTC. The bluetooth,wifi & gps satellites are all off to save the battery but it doesn't help. I don't get if the phone's nova screen & the dual-processor takes a lot of power,why would metro pcs sell the phone with only a 1500mAh when there are other strengths out there available like the 1800 mAh? smh. Now I have to consider spending another $30-$45 on an extended battery which makes the phone even bulkier.
Another thing i dislike about the phone is the front camera, it is not as excellent as the rear-facing camera. I wouldn't mind using the rear-facing camera if there was a shutter button on the side i can use, since i can't see on the screen if i'm trying to take a pic of myself.
If the battery & front cam were better i would be more satisfied considering the price paid for phone-not exactly cheap.",221,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,"This phone is the best phone on MetroPCS as of May 2012.  The processor is fast. There is plenty of memory, the 4g speeds are great (for MetroPCS).  There are only two draw backs, the battery life and the power button.  Battery life is a typical problem for all smart phones, I still ended up buying a 2600 maH after market battery so that I could make it through the day.  A car charger and extra wall chargers are an absolute necessity if you want to be sure to have juice all day. The other annoyance is the power button.  It is set slightly more centered on the top, the button is not where you would expect to find it.  It is also flush with the surface making it difficult to feel. Since it is used frequently to unlock the screen you can see how this would be an issue.

 The screen is large enough that my now aging eyes can see it but it is not so large that I can't slip it in my pocket. The display is bright and sharp.

Of course it does all the normal Android things. Since you're reading this, you likely have already compared the raw factory specs so there is no point in listing all the basic info.  If you haven't seen them, scroll up the page give them a look.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,2.0,negative,this is a decent enough smartphone. Fast and easy to use. The major flaw with this phone is that the battery drains VERY fast.. i cant use my gps for 30miles without having it on charge. if you plan on buying this phone u need to get the car charger and also a extended battery pack wouldn't be a bad idea either.. When i use the phone as a gps unit whilst on charge it won't actually charge it just stops it discharging. Phone gets VERY hot and comes up with a message saying place phone in cool area just before it shuts down... if you have the money id recommend something from verizon but not a bad buy if yo lik dem gettopcs fones.,125,2

If you use car charger and have GPS on, the battery gets so hot you can't hold the phone or have it in your lap while driving.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007FIHLI4,4.0,positive,"The title says it all ... I have owned my LG connect since May 2012. It is fast and responsive. The build quality, like all LG phones is superb. I have accidentally dropped this phone a few times (I use a simple gel case) with absolutely no damage to the phone.
Battery:
Yes, depending on usage, the battery life can be as short as 8 hours (with a fair usage of Google Maps / Navigator which seems to eat up the battery).
Also, I use the LG HB-700, stereo bluetooth, hands-free unit (another product that you will wonder how you did without) and have found that this also tends to lessen the battery life. the solution is simply to plug in the phone when I am driving or sitting at my desk typing (and streaming music to my bluetooth headset).
Negative Comment:
The only real negative comment that I can offer is that the location on the keyboard for the ""change language setting key"" is so horribly placed that you will find yourself suddenly typing in a foreign language when you accidentally hit the dreaded key. It should not even be on the keyboard! Aughhhhh!

This device was fun to play with in the beginning, fairly easy to setup, but difficult to use everyday.  Sometimes the swipes don't register, and sometimes they register the opposite of what I intended.  There's no easy manual or tutorial either, so if you don't enjoy playing with a new toy for a while to learn it, stay away.

I have 3 hours of cycling commuting to/from work.  I have an HTC One X+ phone and I run Google Track to see my progress.  I also run TuneIn radio and listen to music using my LG HBS700 Bluetooth headset.

I got it ... opened it ... hooked it to a computer and updated its firmware.  I got excited at home and after playing around with it I found the plug-ins needed to do what I want it to.  I even installed the LiveView Charm that is supposed to help with the Bluetooth connection.  I start my ride and run the MicroTrack on the LiveView and Google Track on the phone, start my radio and go ...

The watch constantly connects and disconnects ... it interfere with my music on the Bluetooth headset and makes it choppy and eventually freezes up by itself and puts me in a bad move for that ride.

The pros: it vibrates when you get a phone call/text/email/facebook update, plus you can read your messages as well as facebook statuses. Definitely a conversation starter.

Cons: there are not enough plug-ins for it. Also, the bluetooth connect is AWFUL! It disconnects if it is on my left wrist with my phone in my right pocket! Ridiculous. It truly is a waste of money.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007G4PD3M,3.0,neutral,"Overall I am happy that I bough this thing, because I was able to learn for a cheap price that a smart watch is not as useful in person (at least with the tech that's out now). The watch worked and connected with my phone (once you download the app) without any problems. The watch is a little bulky and the band that it comes with is fairly cheap as expected. The reason I isn't as useful though is that any convenience that you would get out of the watch is lost because you have to charge it. It also is more work to go through messages on the watch that it is to just pull out my phone from my pocket. The only thing this watch saves me time on is allowing me to check the time without pulling out my phone. This can be accomplished with a cheap regular watch though.

I was really excited to get this, but was definitely disappointed with it. I gave it a couple weeks for it to grow on me, but now it just sits on my desk collecting dust. Considering it was only $20, I can't complain too much.

If you think a smart watch might be for you and are thinking about getting a more expensive one, you might want to try this out first since it's only $20. Obviously it wouldn't be as nice as a pricier one, but you may be able to learn like I did if you would actually use it.

I bought one locally and it did the dead battery dance,  returned it and the replacement did the same.  Hoping that amazon had better stock, I ordered one and it did the same thing.  All of them out there have batteries that are at the end of life.

Also, this product is NOT for the 7"" Kindle Fire HD. Original listing only mentioned the 7"" Kindle Fire, so I mistakenly purchased this, thinking the screen protector would fit (in reading the previous reviews, I see that I am not the only one to have run into this problem).

Fair enough....you get what you pay for. HOWEVER, the bigger issues rest with the sellers. Very poor customer service. Aggressive about who was to blame in the mix up. Offered partial refund if I paid an additional $5?....original shipping was only $1.99. Why am I paying more to return an item I'm already paying to return? Doesn't make sense, and the item certainly isn't worth it. Even worse, I asked the sellers twice, about purchasing more of the earphones (yes, the broken ones) that had come with the set. They were so busy telling me that it was my fault, they never even acknowledged that I'd wanted to GIVE THEM MORE MONEY. I guess my business just isn't that important to them. LOL! Probably dodged a bullet there, anyway.

However the yes it can hold a Kindle fire 7"" but with limitations.
1. Once inside the kindle is wider that the case can hold correctly.
2. This in turn makes it impossible for closing flap to properly secure the kindle.
Therefore the dimensions are off when it comes to properly securing your kindle in its case.
Or give the benefit of the doubt, I just got a smaller case than that which was previously advertised.
Thank you none the less.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007RRPPH2,3.0,neutral,"The only reason I did not give a 1 as a rating is because of their customer service and the cover. I read all the reviews and knew there was a chance that one of the chargers may not work. Nothing I purchased was designed for a Kindle Fire and the plugs did not charge my Kindle Fire at all. Once I realized that none of the products would work for their initial purpose, I contacted the seller and voiced my issues, after 2 email communications, one of which I asked for at least half of my money back for falsely advertising the product. They requested pictures of the items, which I supplied, and they returned all of my money back. Very fast service!
The case is very nice, even though it is not for the Kindle Fire, it at least fits. The hands-free (ear buds), are nice as well. Lastly, the car charger and the wall charger, work perfect for my and my families' phones. My husband ended up going and purchasing me a replacement wall charger.",178,108

Only to find out that only 2 of the 5 items actually worked. The case was fine along with the earbuds bug both chargers (wall and car) did not work. The wall charger would light up once plugged in but it wasn't actually charging. The car charger did not respond at all. The screen protector did not work well for us.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007RRPPH2,3.0,neutral,"I have a couple of complaints for this. The case is the reason I bought this. But the charger doesn't fit all the way. I was able to use it with my phone, so it wasn't a total loss. The ear buds are kinda low quality, about what you'd get with a CD player back when Earbuds first came out. the car charger again, I can't use it with my Kindle. I am able to use it with my phone. But the problem I see here, is that all of the things in the set should be high quality. The screen protector is very good and the case is about medium quality. What you get for the prices is ok. But as I said, if you're spending money to get all 5 products. Then all 5 should work with the Kindle (in the case of the chargers that don't) and the Ear Buds should not be so low quality.",159,112

None of the chargers really work and scrape when inserted to port. The wall charger ""charges"" for a couple minutes then stops working, the car charger doesn't charge at all and doesn't reach from the console to the passenger's lap (I have a small car).  Both chargers DO charge my cellphone but are extremely flimsy construct. If I were looking for chargers and not covers when I got this, I would be very upset, but I viewed them as a bonus to finding covers that I wouldn't have a fit over if the kids destroyed them. Don't expect great things from the ear buds either, the text to speech function through them is fine but don't expect to rock out listening to music or anything like that.",148,124
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,5.0,positive,I looked all over trying to fine the exact case I needed for my daugher in laws phone.  This was perfect. i LOVE that it has a built in screen protector.  Those that just stick on are incredibly hard to use and don't last. Exactly what she needed and wanted.

I have the Otterbox version which this is a knock off of, which is perfect.

My wife wanted a pink one, so we tried this one. It was broken in the package, the plastic was brittle the rubber was so thin it provided no protection, nor could it even hold form around the plastic portion well enough to function.

This is just a poorly done knock off, and not worth the money. Don't bother with this one.",81,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,5.0,positive,This is a great little case. Works pretty well. The otter box defender for HTC is almost 50 bucks. I'd buy several of these and throw away as they go bad... before I'd buy a otter box defender.....at 50% bucks,40,10

I don't have to fiddle with making sure everything is clean and waste three sticky protectors before I get it good enough right to protect the screen. The black piece is very nice and snaps together rather easy. The rubber piece has nice groves on the side and is pretty flexible.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,4.0,positive,"It could be a little more firm-or-possibly-a ""cushion effect"" built into the back part of the case.

My only complaint was little  rubber parts (the flaps that hold the rubber onto the hard plastic) they felt very flimsy I felt it if I pulled it out of my pocket too hard or too fast it would rip.

Other than that it is an absolutely WONDERFUL case for the price and protection!",68,35

I think I'll be buying it in a different color than white as well, as it attracts dirt and hair and doesn't look nice. The only complaints I have is that the flap covering the bottom is a bit dodgy; it doesn't stay closed, and the piece of silicone holding it on seems like it will tear soon. Also, I have to readjust the outer silicone part constantly, as it doesn't stay on entirely well.

I do, however, like the plastic screen covering; if I happen to have oil or water on my hands, it doesn't get onto the screen itself, and the plastic covering isn't too apparent, especially when the screen is on.",126,37

I would either go back to buying an otterbox or a different off-brand. Use the word ""hardcore"" in your search. That's how I found the one I really wanted. This one sucks!!!",81,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,4.0,positive,For the price you can't beat it its likes a cheap other box the only problem I have is getting the rubber part to stay on real good(it stays on just some corners come off) but it works good for the price,42,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,3.0,neutral,"its and ok case, not nearly as sturdy as the otterbox for it. i drop my phone every now and then so i need a good case to protect it and within the first 2 weeks it cracked, my otterbox lasted almost a year. but i guess u get ur moneys worth when its only $7.99",56,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,2.0,negative,"I was kind of surprised when i got it, because it looks pretty nice in the picture, but putting it on my phone it looks pretty junky. the outer case is rubber and it is always slipping off. the bottom rubber piece that covers the hole that you charge your phone with fell off almost a week later. I noticed that when I got it it was hardly hanging on at all.",72,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,3.0,neutral,"I love the fact that it has the plastic screen protector attached, but the rubber outside constantly came off and it got all bumpy and wouldnt ever stay on for more than 5 mins.",34,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,5.0,positive,Works great!! Protects like a dream! Easily removable!  Cheaper than the Otterbox my daughter wanted and it comes in colors that the otterbox doesn't for my daughters particular phone.,29,77
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007SJHHH0,5.0,positive,"This is indeed the best case you can buy for your HTC Inspire 4G or Desire 4G. I am personally using it for the Inspire 4G. The case itself has 3 parts of protection. 1) The silicone 2) The hard plastic 3) The screen protector. Great color selection, and it is a great combination with this case.",57,78

I used it on my phone for a couple of months and the pearls began to come off, but that's expected. WARNING, the lace is white and will turn to a nasty color, to fix it, I took it off my phone, ran it under water and put some soap on it and gently lathered the soap and rinsed it off and it was back to its white color.",89,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,"I like it a lot, very classy looking. A little cheaply made, however for the price I was satisfied",19,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,I knew I was buying a cheap product which I didn't mind seeing as I have purchased cheap products from over seas before. Upon receiving my case it looks like my ten year old sister made it. The glue is bulky and bulging between pearls. The pearls look as if the phone was just dipped in glue then dumped in pearls. Sloppy and unorganized. And the lace was not as pictured as well. It was about half of what is pictured. Seeing as the case was only a dollar and some change I'm not too upset. But I definitely could have done a better job making the case myself and might actually redo it.,114,16
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,Love this phone case! It's great for the price too!  Shipping took like 3 weeks but other than that I have nothing bad to say.,25,17

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"When you look at this case from a distance, it looks really cute.  When you look at it closer it looks very cheap.  The fabric was not glued down well on the edges, and there were clumps of glue on it.  Very cheaply made product.",45,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"It took an entire month for me to get the phone case in the mail. Once I received it, I thought that it would be a bit more sturdier, but it was light. I thought the case would actually hold some support on my phone, but it doesn't. If I were to drop my phone I know that the case would not protect the phone. The lace portion of the case was dirty within a matter of minutes. The case does not offer a protective covering for the design to prevent it from getting dirty or falling apart.",98,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,My only problem was that the lace gets dirty from always being in my hands and eventually it started peeling back as well.  Good for the price though.,28,22
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,okay so i bought this because the picture makes it look so good. i had a few pearls missing and it didn't match the picture hardly. there were scratch marks in the black. And the first time i go to put it on my phone it fell and landed on its face and cracked the whole front screen. So i wasn't very pleased with this case very heavy,68,23

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,When I got the case there were lots of the white stones missing. I also thought that I was getting something that did not have glue all over it on the bottom of the case,35,27
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,Not at all what I expected! The case looks like someone looked at this picture and tried to remake it. You can see glue between the pearls! ,27,28

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,I was expecting the case to be a bit shinier not matte looking. It arrived after a month. But still looks cute tho. Just as ot is in the pic,30,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,"This case is very pretty, but I am going to try spraying the lace part with some kind of spray to protect it from oils in your hands, makeup,etc. Will get dirty very easily.",34,36
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"Very cheap looking, but I shouldn't have been so surprised since I did buy it for very cheap. The pearls fell off and the lace lifted up within a few days. And the case itself broke very easy. Your better off spending a little more money for something more reliable",50,37

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,"This is a cheaply made case. The lace and pearls will peel off within a week. The lace gets dirty and dingy. it seemed like a good idea at first, but I really should never have purchased this crappy product.",40,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,It doesn't look exactly like the picture but I guess for $2 I shouldn't complain? The picture looks WAY better,20,42

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,"A vey cute case it it's just thin plastic and doesn't wrap around the edges of the phone. The phone also won't lay flat because of the pearls.however this was very cheap so you can't expect superior construction. Buy for the look, not protection.",44,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,"I've had the case for a little over 3 months now and I absolutely love it! Some of the lace is no longer attached to the case (the bottom part) but it doesn't look bad. All of my pearls are still intact and I've dropped this case many times on concrete, tile, and wood. I would recommend the case especially because of the price.",64,45

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,It fell apart and I lookes different then the picture. It is a terible phone case I was exited to get it then I see this piece of poop,29,48
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"It's really pretty. But it's also cheaply made. When I received it, ugly dried glue was all over it. Soon the lace began to peel and the black plastic got easily scratched. Luckily, I was able to glue the lace back on nicely. Certainly cheaply made, but for a couple bucks, that's what you can expect.",56,49

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,"It was pathetic. Not only did it take two months to get here, it was a huge disappointment when it did. It doesn't say it's shipping from Hong Kong but it did. It was shoddy and ridiculous looking and it went in the garbage right away. NEVER buying from them again.",51,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,Is a really cute case but the lace fell apart on my second day having it. It was not worth the wait. I'm disappointed. I suggest you don't buy it if you're gonna have your phone in your pockets a lot.,41,55

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,This case is horrible... It looks nothing like this when you receive it.. The pearls obviously the cheap plastic kind and I can see the the glue.. On top of that they used real lace and then they didn't even cut it to match the case... Ive been trying to return it but they have to approve the return which they haven't done.. Dont even waste your money.. It may be cheap but it's not worth it.,77,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,This looks like an elegant cover but I was very dissapointed when it came. The lace is just a piece of real lace glued onto the plastic cover.  I could have made this myself.,34,76

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,This case really wasn't as good as it looked. The white lace first got dirty in no time and finally it started coming off. But I guess you can't get a better product just for 2 dollars.,37,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,Looks nice on the picture.  Very cheap product.  Lace and pearls came off within a week.  Could have made it better myself.,22,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,It's very pretty. My teen just loves it. I think it would be nicer if it was more sealed so the beads don't get damaged.,25,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,The lace came looking used because it was brown and also stringy like it was unraveling. This was very poorly made.,21,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,"I bought this, I have an iPod , but I pt dose fit in it. If a really good case for the price, and it's so cute.

So now I have my 2 twin cousins asking me to order them one!",71,87

it is a little hard to get the case back off once it is on the phone especially when you have acrylic nails lol! but it's cute, didn't take too long to get here and I got alot of Compliments :)",65,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,It looked ok when it arrived but lost two beads within the hour. I've had it for three days and the lace is peeling as well as more lost beads.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"I brought this case hoping to be a good one. It turns out that the lace doesn't like in the picture. It looks cheap and not pretty.
When I got it in the mail, it was not glue completely on. They sent extra pearls and glue inside of package.
Honestly, It is a cute case but I wouldn't waste my money again.",62,95
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"This case is very adorable but not practical. When I recieved the case (which was ahead of time which was nice) it was already missing multiple pearls and the lace was barely attached. Its nice for the price, if you don't mind having to glue everything back on, but not something i would buy again.",55,96
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,"I fell in love with this cover however there were three things that I was concerned about after I bought it. The cover doesn't cover the front portion of the iPhone leaving it susceptible to scratches. (2) The lace portion of the case is pretty however it gets dirty pretty quickly--a quick fix would be to put clear nail polish over the lace portion in order for it to not get dirty and to prevent the edges of the lace from fraying. (3) The pearls in the top right corner will eventually pop off.
Overall, I think the case is cute to use for the time being, but it won't last that long.",113,97
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,This is a piece of crap for lack of better words. I'm glad it was only $2.50. Not happy at all.,21,98
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,"This case is so cute, and the quality is very impressive for the price. Although, the lace is fraying slightly on the sides, but it isn't so bad.

Once it gets on the phone, it's a bit hard to get off, but it does come off.

I suggest it.",49,99

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,It is fancy  not good for everyday use but when you want to feel fancy this does the trick they also supply you with extra beads and glue in case yours don't hold up :),35,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,Love this case! It was exactly as promised. They even included extra pieces and glue just for safe keeping. I've not had to use it. I'm hard on cases but this one is still holding up perfectly.,37,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,"This is a really cute phone case, but it kind of fell apart on my after about two weeks.  The lace frayed on the edges and started coming off as well as collecting dirt, and the pearls started losing their paint.  It was only 99 cents, so I guess I got what I paid for.
I just wish it would have lasted longer!",63,106
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,It's okay. The lace isn't glued down so it tears and gets very dirty from normal use. Probably wouldnpt recommend it.,21,107

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,3.0,neutral,"The case is very pretty, my daughter loves it but the only thing is the lace along the edges is not attached well.  We are trying to figure out a way to attach it better without ruining the case.",39,109

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,"I couldn't wait to get this case! Because it ships from Hong Kong, it took a few weeks to get here but totally worth the wait! It is so beautiful. The combination of the pearls and the lace make it very elegant and girly. This will not be a case I use day to day, as I would fear wear and tear on and around the pearls, but this will be my case I use when dressing up and going out- when I usually don't carry a purse- just my phone or a clutch. It's a great accessory to match all your dressy clothes and jewelry :) and the price was unbeatable!!!!",112,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,This case is way too cheesy looking. It looks good in the photo but up close it is honestly ugly. U can see the glue they used to put the lace on. I didn't like it. At least it wasn't expensive making it that much more a waste of money. No I wouldn't recommend this product.,56,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,I can make this phone case my self. The white design got dirty really easy. So i order a new diffrent case.,22,113

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,It looks good on internet but cheap when you get it. It's worth the price and I can see glue on the back of the case holding the design fabric on.,31,115

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,5.0,positive,"My daughter just received this phone case after a veeeery long wait and she love's it!!!! First of all I was aware that the case was coming from Hong Kong and would be over a month before it arived and still it arrived in time, it actually arrived early (in teen age years veeeery long time).... She loves it her friend next door wants one and I'm a satisfied customer and would recommend the seller and the product....",78,123
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,"It looks adorable on the picture, and was excited to order it. So I did and it came in on time. When i opened the package it was very poorly made.

So i just took off EVERYTHING and had the black case....It looked better.",78,124
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,Good price but cheap. it got very icky looking after 3 days of use and it fell apart very fast.,20,125
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,2.0,negative,"I liked the look and bought it on impulse when I was shopping for phone covers.  The lace design is actual fabric lace cut to size and glued on.  You get a little tube of glue with the cover, and I found out why because the lace began to come off the first day.  Also, the cover fits very, VERY tightly (I have an iPhone 4S) and it was extremely difficult to remove the cover when I wanted to change it out.  I wouldn't recommend for casual use, if you put it on it's there to stay for awhile!  And unfortunately the embellishments are not there to stay so keep the glue handy.",113,126
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,"It's cheaply made .. But what do you expect it was only $2.75 .. The white studs are falling off already , the material is peeling up",27,127

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,This was terrible. I got it and it was already torn. It had the pearls coming off the side. It looked awful! I suggest to not buy it! It isn't worth the money!,33,132

And the other is just from everyday use, two of the little pearls came off. Other than that this was a very cute and affordable case!",68,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,"i had this for less than 2 weeks and already everything was starting to fall off. In the end I just peeled everything off of it and made my own case. Unless you are looking for just a plain black case and want to peel everything off it, DO NOT buy this case.",53,137
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,1.0,negative,I thought it was a screen print of lace on the case but it's real lace that is basically falling off as soon as you get it in the mail I was only able to keep mine on for one day there was glue everywhere I thing my 8year old sister could do a better job at gluing,58,138
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,"Amazing fast shipping! Received it way earlier than expected. I love it for just a pretty decorative case, but it's not something that will save it from a high hard fall if that's what you're looking for.",37,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,Looks very nice. However the lace is not shellacked so I am concerned about it staying in the case. So far however it is staying on  very nicely. Shipping was rather fast. I will buy from them again,38,140

It arrived more than 2 weeks early. The only thing was that a little section of it wasn't attached so just take clear nail polish and put it under the lace.
Lots of compliments- GET",45,150
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B007Y73CGQ,4.0,positive,"I chose this rating because the product that I received looks just like the picture!

I ended up supergluing the lace to the case.",68,156

I have an iPhone 4s and Other than protecting my screen, the mirror is actually really great ! It's not like those weird mirrors that you can barely see yourself in it. It's kind of hard to see outside when it's daylight but what did you expect, it's a MIRROR screen. either you want a good mirror that looks kinda bad, or a bad mirror that allows you to see your screen. I do have a white iPhone and it looks lavender purple color. It's really easy to apply. It's like a colorful screen in a way. But I love it !

This book is VERY poorly written.  The sentences are choppy and don't seem to fit together well.  The characters are bland.  It's just really, really bad.  I should have known it wasn't going to be any good when I saw that it was by the same author who wrote Cranwood.  I didn't like that book either, but The Tree of Bones is even worse.",94,13

Kindle_Store,B00CNTQKYG,3.0,neutral,"If you don't mind poor grammar and choppy writing, then this story is okay. The storytelling itself is good. There's even diary entries from a Ukrainian character that mimic what the main character is going through. But there are some glaring typos and rushed writing as though the author did a first draft without bothering to read back what was written and then just hit the publish button. It has some action to it but without scares. Mind you, this is the ""revised"" edition from September.

Also, the story takes place in the Ukraine and I'm pretty sure the country's moniker is ""the Ukraine""; but in this story the author constantly refers to it as ""Ukraine"". And the language Ukrainian people speak is Russian, not Ukrainian as the author laughably states. There's very little in the way of description or names of towns so it doesn't feel authentic.",148,16
Kindle_Store,B00CNTQKYG,3.0,neutral,I admit it some parts cut me off guard but there were many spelling errors and grammar errors.

Kindle_Store,B00CNTQKYG,1.0,negative,"When I read the description of the book I was intrigued and hopeful. But after reading 30% of it, I have found it lacking. The premise is good, but the writing style is disappointed. The writing is juvenile at best. The sentences don't flow together and the chapters are choppy and disconnected. Almost rushed. As if the author just wanted to finish the story instead of taking time to follow it to the end. I also found it highly unbelievable that a doctor would actually suggest possession as an actual diagnosis. The spelling and grammar were also lacking. I feel that a professional writer should be able to proofread better than that. I couldn't force myself to finish reading it. It was quite simply the worst book I have ridden thus far.",132,28

Kindle_Store,B00D6XE2GQ,3.0,neutral,"I consider myself a tough critic, I thought the writing of this book was wonderful.  The only reason I didn't score this higher is that I absolutely loath stories that don't end.  We never discover why this happened, the motive.  We don't learn how this happened when the circumstances ( the size of the men) should've prevented it.  How is it all possible?  We don't learn what happens next.  We don't understand the characters.  It was merely a collection of events.  I realize this is the first in a series, but serial books should EACH begin and end, even if the characters continue on.

Kindle_Store,B00D6XE2GQ,3.0,neutral,"Faith had everything.  Shes married to her soul mate the man of her dreams, Mac Byrne.  They had a wonderful son in his teens, and a baby on the way.  They didn't have much but they had each other.

She didn't want to tell him about the accident that they had that day for fear that Mac would be harder on their son than he needed to me.  Their son seemed to be more sensitive like his mother.  Of course he had to blurt out about the crazy girl, so she had to explain things.

She did everything right at the accident.  Pulling over to check on the girl they hit.  Exchanging insurance, and other information with the intention of calming the teenage girl.  That is until her father came knocking on their door in a wild rage.  Mac, a very big man, tried to take him on but the man was crazed.  She pulled her son into his room, coax him out the window to get help, and then when everything quieted she open the door.  Only to find Mac had expired in the stairwell.  How would they continue living without him?

This starts as a very calm and regular book, but becomes odd and dark quickly.  You will have to read this to understand the emotional side of it.",221,45

The writing details are also a bit askew on several obvious facts which bother some people a great deal.  If you can get past those two things and keep reading you will find a horror story not a romantic mystery.  The mother in this work is supposedly one of those women who loves her husband and her son beyond anything else.  The fact that she is carrying her second child evokes the reader's understanding.  But, the 15-year-old son is really a study in opposites.  When you think he will be strong he is weak and when he is weak he should be strong.  The husband who is a strong--very strong--and likable man is removed so early that the reader has to blink the eyes to remember him.  The character of the psycho, Emily, and her father are not clearly drown and just as one gets into the plot and begins to understand a part of it, the novel ends.  Very short, but limiting.",191,47

It has very underdeveloped characters, stereotypical even, with annoyingly perfect omniscient insight. The antagonists have no back story or dimension as a part of this socially oversimplified novella. The protagonists are too perfect.
The author also talks about abuse without capturing the devastation or repercussions of it. I honestly doubt she even could fathom how ugly abuse is.

The characters are larger than life, with realistic personalities. Angie and Melissa in particular are extremely entertaining, the sort of friends youd love to go for a cocktail with-funny, gossipy, and not to mention the hilarious one-liners throughout the whole book. No spoilers, but a murder takes place, and you're left with the whodunnit question in your head. The book isn't predicable, so you may have no idea who committed the murder. I like Angie and Melissa so I am rooting for their happily ever afters, and I really hope that they both find love, or at least contentment with their lives, both personally and career-wise. I would read the other books in this authors series, for sure. P.S. This does end on a cliffhanger, but you WILL want to know what happens.

Every time something happens at the end of each chapter so I want to know what happens next. I have really bad concentration levels so I can't get into a book easily.

Someone should be very embarrassed for allowing this ""book"" out in the public when it should not even be published as a high school project.  The story line is almost as weak as the writing.

Too many plot possibilities with little or no resolution make this piece painful.

This writer needs a real publisher and a real editor,,,,trying to read this mess was painful!! She also needs to write about something she knows.

She has a shoe designer running around paying no attention to her business during fashion week. The designer has an assistant she parties with who doesn't know her shoe designer employer's shoe size or that she has over 300 pairs of shoes. The writer tries to establish wealth by claiming her character received a 2 million dollar apartment from her parents and dropping expensive shoe labels, then makes a point of saying that her character curls up in her 300 dollar comforter set!! Apparently this writer knows nothing at all about the design business or wealth!!  Fiddling around with personal crap during fashion week?? A 300 dollar comforter?? Give me a break!!

These are just a few observations, this entire book is a train wreck. I forced myself halfway through it but could not finish it.
