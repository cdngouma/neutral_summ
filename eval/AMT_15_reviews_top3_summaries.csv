B000JCDUFG,this newspaper is great to read good for the mind of keeping people informed,Had some business in Denver that required some research regarding local activities and various demographics. The Denver Post is a well organized paper that helped me complete my work there easily and effortlessly. It also steered me to a couple of fabulous restaurants during my stay.  Thanks Denver Post.,Not the newspaper it use to be but the sports section is always worth reading.  Subscription prices are too high but the Kindle edition is very reasonable.  I will probably never go back to the Post directly to subscribe again.,"I like the paper but, during the two week trial period, there was a problem receiving it on my Kindle.  Not once, but twice in two weeks.  Unacceptable for me so I canceled my subscription.","I don't live in Denver, and getting a copy occasionally on Kindle for a reasonable price is a great feature.  But since I am supposed to be reviewing the January 29th, 2012 edition, here it is.

Not much special happened in Colorado that day, I guess, but they sure did a spanking good job writing it up.  Keep up the good work and I will try another edition soon.","I've been a subscriber for going on 2 years now.  Glitch here and there made delivery late, but I survived so that I could get my Bronco news.  A couple of weeks ago, the Post announced a cutback in employees and it's obvious that some must have been involved in the Kindle edition. Content has gone down by almost 50%. I'm going to keep it for a little while longer to give them a fair chance.","I wanted the local paper while in Denver recently for a vacation.  I received my paper every morning without fail so I wonder if the earlier delivery issues haven't been fixed.

The paper was easy to navigate and easy to read.  I give the Denver Post 3 stars because there is no Weather (really?  a paper with no weather report?!) and I found myself really wanting pictures.","I enjoy reading the paper on my time schedule. When I received a message ""delivery would be delayed"", I canceled. I thought they would have had that problem addressed by now.","I used to have a subscription to the Denver Post when they delivered it outside of the metro area, but living in the mountains meant that one good snowstorm equals no delivery until later on in the day if at all. Then in one of their economy moves, they stopped delivering the daily edition completely.  With the newest edition of the Kindle software, delivery takes less than 45 seconds after waking the Kindle, and it happens even if the chain law is in effect on Vail Pass. One added advantage is that you get your local news wherever you are - at home, or vacationing in California or anywhere there's a Wi-fi connection.  Which means almost anywhere in the world.

As a newspaper reader from way back it took me a while to get used to looking at the Kindle screen instead of turning pages.

I value local news, and if you live in the Rocky Mountain west, the Denver Post is probably one of the best sources.  And at $6/month, the price is certainly competitive with other online papers.",Love it! Reading it is so easy....love saving the trees! So easy to hold. Easy to flip thru sections - I recommend it!,"Signed up and got the paper yesterday. Today I got a download that says ""Sorry, The Denver Post will be late today"" Now 12:46pm and still no paper.","The Post has finally gotten it's delivery problems mostly resolved.  It is still the Electronic step child behind their pdf version.  That is frustrating because the Kindle edition is much easier to read.

Subscibing to the Denver Post makes it all too clear why newspapers are a dying industry.  For almost two months the Post has been completely unreliable and no one will take responsibility.  Amazon says that the problem is at the Denver Post and that I need to contact them directly.  The Post claims that they don't sell subscriptions via the Kindle and that I must have them confused with a different newspaper.  There is no one to explain why they have suddenly been so unreliable and there is no one who can explain why and when they are likely to get better.  This is my local paper and I would really like to read it.","It is great to be able to get the Denver Post on Kindle to keep up to date with the ""Mile High City""!",On my kindle fire each morning when I turn it on,"This is the first newspaper I've subscribed to on my Kindle.  I was hesitant at first because so many people wrote about delivery problems, but those issues have clearly been resolved.  I've been a subscriber now for a few months, and I only missed my download once -- and it was because I turned off my wireless on a flight and forgot to turn it back on! :)  This paper is easy to navigate, easy to read, and best of all you don't get any newspaper ink on your fingers, which I used to hate!  I'm a happy Denver Post customer!",the customers feel that the newspaper they bougth is worth reading and got information regarding the local activities and prices are reasonale too.,"the newspaper is a nice read with updated news everyday. however it doesn't always arrive on time, and it has some delivery problems.",the newspaper is easy to read and navigate and apart from some delivery issues is well made,
B000M92GLK,"This is the only Bluetoothe handsfree that works great with my new Iphone 3G.
People tell me that it sounds as if I have the phone up to my mouth, and it does not drop calls.
I can't believe I was able to buy it for such a low price!  Awesome!","I bought this for use with Skype.  I'm using Windows 7 64bit on a laptop with a blue tooth adapter.  The headset would pair fine but that's it.  I could not change setting and no other program on my computer would recognize it for use.  Plantronic's forum offered no help, blaming the problem on Microsoft.  Many other users there had similar issues with their devices from Plantronics.  I will try another brand.","Very good clarity, so much so that you have to turn the volume down.  With other ear pieces - at maximum - still could not hear.  Convenient car charger.  Stays in the ear perfectly - 3 sizes to choose from - to fit everyone.","This headset delivers everything as advertised by Plantronics. I purchased this model because it is compatible with the iPhone. I really love that it is so lightweight -- definitely the lightest of all headsets I've seen. The one feature that I find most outstanding is that the headset stores in a clip-on tube that you can keep in your shirt pocket for easy access. Also this storage tube helps to protect the headset when it is in your pocket, etc...

My only critique is that the ear bud gets dirty very quickly and needs to be washed often. It is made out of a plastic material that is very soft to help hold the headset in your ear. But that type of material picks up dirt and dust.

I liked this headset so much that I also bought one from a friend's birthday. He has a Motorola RAZR and this headset also works great with that cellphone.","Very good sound quality but people can't seem to hear too well when the car window is down.  doesn't drop its signal as much as the older model.  actually, I've had this for 2 months now and i can only remember losing signal only 2 times.  all in all, it's a very good value and worth it's price.","My complaint is mostly with the CHARGER. The bluetooth itself fit comfortably in my ear, with some adjusting, no problem with sound quality on either end. The only issue I have is the ""unique"" charger. It is a nice carrier to put in your pocket to protect your bluetooth, but if you lose it or it breaks, you're hosed. You can't charge without it, the other chargers listed with the product are attachments to the housing unit. I preferred my older Plantronics Explorer 220, because I was able to switch between my phone and the headset for my car. One less cord! It says there is an accessory for the mini usb charger, but I've yet to find it here or the Plantronic website. Hope this helps, if you don't want another cord to worry about, check the products website to see what connection it uses.","I have had this Plantronics Discovery 665 Bluetooth headset for two days and everyone I call tells me I sound very muffled.  I can hear them fine, but they cannot understand me.  They can hear me, but cannot understand what I am saying most of the time.  I am returning this item.","got it for my gf about 6 month ago, since then only problems, mostly mechanical, the ear piece falls easily and she ended up loosing all 3 ear pieces and then the part that goes around the ear (cheap plastic, no wire inside) broke as well. dont' even think about it.",easy to connect to iPhone good sound  I especially like the options available for comfortable wearing Looks dorky but they all do!!!,Great form factor - comfortable - excellent sound quality and noise cancellation.  3.5 to 4 hours talk time might not be enough.  Portable charging station is cool - car charger included - also cool.  Highly recommend this.,"I've tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I've had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise.  The Plantronics 665 is great.  In fact I actually had to turn down the volume a bit.  I also noticed it connects instantly to the phone where my old Motorolla had a slight delay.  I would have given this 5 stars except a lot of background noise is picked up by those on the other end of the line.  Overall a very clean design.  Other than the road noise, people on the other end didn't know I was using a wireless headset.  Nice small design fit my ear well.  The DC charging station/dock for the car is great.  Charges as well from your PC USB.  I'm using this with my Palm Treo 755p.","The product arrived within days of the order and it was sleek in its appearance.
Yet that's where the excitement ended. Call volume was low and the amount of static
was unbearable.  I really expected more from Plantronics.  Too say the least, this
product was returned due to poor sound quality.","This headset is the best I've ever had.  People actually hear me, and I hear them better when I'm using the headset than when I'm on the handset.  What more can I say it's great!  Even the people that use to complain and tell me to stop using my BT, have stopped nagging me.  Very pleased with this one, finally a good BT headset.","This headset is fine as long as you don't use it inside the car. If you do, the hum (road noise, wind noise, etc.) is almost unacceptable on the listener's side.",Purchased this ear piece the replace a plantronic's ear piece I lost. It works really good and sound is clear. it was a very good price,"a headset that is light and comfortable with a good fit and good quality and very loud sound, for a lower price.","this bluetooth handsfree works great, has very good clarity and noise cancellation, is easy to use, requires no configuration, charges through pc usb port, and the sound is sharp, clear, and crisp.it is sometimes not recognized by the system for use.","the headset is well made and it's really easy to connect to bluetooth. the microphone has a nice quality and the sound is good. however it has mechanical problems, and the material quality isn't the highest.",
B000Q5J2M6,"I purchased this as a friend has one and I read the positive reviews and thought this was going to be a good bluetooth device. Well, it's not working the way it's intended. This is the first bluetooth device I have tried to own.

I originally bought this from Amazon and after charging it up completely I could only get less than 24 hours on it in standby. I contacted Cardo and they told me that it could be the coupling to the phone and asked which phone I have. After another email to them they said it sounds like a defective headset and I can send it back, which I did. I received a replacement one very quickly and it has the same problem AND people tell me it has too much static for them to talk comfortably to me with it. I could live with the battery life as I only use it in the car while driving but can't live with the static so it is useless IMO.

I will say that Cardo was extremely customer oriented and Amazon's customer service was great as well but this device doesn't live up to what I was hoping for. I would not recommend it.","I have my Cardo Scala paired with a Sanyo Katana II cell phone. People say they can hear me fine, but on my end, voices sound a bit hollow. Also, when I hear my cell phone ring, it takes about five rings before the Scala picks up the signal. Those are my issues with it. For the price, I can live with it because I only use it for a few minutes a day during my short commute to work. But if you're someone uses a bluetooth all day, I would look at a different one.","I've owned a Scala 500, a 700, and now the 700LX (in addition to a few models of Motorola headsets).  The Scalas absolutely have the best sound clarity, and handle wind noise far better than any Motorola I've used.  I only recently replaced my 500 (battery gave out after a couple years hard usage and it wouldn't hold a charge) with a 700, which I loved--until it made an unscheduled trip through the washing machine.  The 700LX is nearly identical to the 700, with one added improvement.  The earpiece on the 700LX, unlike the base 700, has a much stiffer wire for custom fit.  This way when you get it to fit, it is more likely to fit AFTER you mash it around in your pocket.  Another great feature is turning off the blue blinky LED, so you can be a bit more disreet when calling.  It has a bunch of other features, too many to list but most are useful. I'm surprised this brand isn't more commonly availabe in stores--it works outside in the wind, it has great sound, and is tiny.  What more can you ask for?","This is the second Scala 700 set that I've owned. The first one developed a crack right on the seam after less than a year of use (I didn't drop it). I tried super glue but the glue may have gotten into the circuitry because the microphone stopped working.

Overall, the headset feels flimsy and if you grip it too tightly, it will crack. However, we all want a lightweight headset...so maybe I shouldn't complain. The Scala picks up all outgoing calls automatically after you dial the # on your cell phone. However, you have to press the button on the Scala after picking up incoming calls. This results in a 2-3 second delay...an eternity if you've got another person on the line saying ""hello? hello?"".

It's got its drawbacks but it's the only headset that works consistently with my Treo 650.",After evaluating many bluetooth headsets in this price range I choose this one based on features and reviews. Unfortunately the first one recieved was defective and would not hold a charge. Amazaon quickly replaced it and the second unit works well. It has an automatic answer feature so you do not have to take your hands off the wheel to anawer incoming calls. You can turn this feature on or off. Overall it appears to be a very good unit.,"This headset performs exceptionally well for such a light device.  It's almost so small that you can lose track of it in a pocket.  Even comes with a carrying case!

Battery life is very good, and speaker volume was actually too high at times (but easily adjusted).  When speaking with other people, they were able to hear me very clearly.  Occasionally, the noise canceling would cut off my voice if I was too quiet.  When driving in a car, this happened rather frequently.

In short, this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments.  The Jawbone may be better at managing noise, but it's far more expensive.  Get this if you're looking for a deal.","I got the Cardo SCALA 700LX to replace my Cardo SCALA500 which I really liked but unfortunately lost. I also had a motorola which had terrible range and no volume so I decided to go for another Cardo headset.

I looked at the original SCALA 500 and 700LX and decided to get the upscaled model. It is smaller than the 500, works just as well, has a few more features like bluetooth 2.0. Includes AC & car charger. Works perfectly with the iPhone.","The 700 was better than the 500 but less comfortable.  However the sound quality was so good my wife also bought one.  The biggest problem we had at first was bending the ear piece to be at least moderately comfortable.

My wife's headset fell apart (literally) one day.  She still uses it but holds it together with rubber bands.  A couple months later, mine also fell apart.  Unfortunately, mine hit the ground after breaking in two and stopped working.  Neither of us dropped our headsets; they just came apart at the seam.

If it didn't have such good sound and work well for voice dialing, the discomfort and flimsiness would have me lowering it another star or two.","This headset was a bit of a disappointment as it has a lot of background noise, sounds a little fuzzy and doesn't stay snug to the ear.",I have never used an ear piece before but I am impressed with this one so far.,I ordered this as I have had the cardo 500 and found it to be good value.  My 700 LX arrived and would not take a charge.  Returned it and got another.  Same problem.  Cardo says send it back to them (and pay my own postage) and they will send me a working one.  I'm thinking maybe I will just get something else.  Fed up with wasting money on postage and time going to post office.,"I bought this headset mainly because it was ranked as having really good loud incoming volume.  It does.  I can hear people in the car now.  It's great from that point.

The only slight problem I have is the microphone volume - people I speak to often hear echoes and I cannot adjust anything to get rid of them.

Still, it was a worthwhile purchase.",this is a great headset it works well comfortable easy to use and the price is right. I would recomend this to anyone looking to buy a headset,It didn't work for me it would only link to my phone when it was plugged up.,Original unit was defective. Asked for replacement which works perfectly. Returning original unit for credit.,"Overall the reviews are mixed, while some users note the superb audio quality and other users are disappointed and received a defective unit.","A lightweight Bluetooth headset. Compatible with many devices, including iPhone. Automatic answer feature. Loud incoming call volume.","the headset offers good volume control for incoming sounds, but it sometimes has a problem holding a charge.",
B000SRGF2W,I liked the plot but I felt there wasn't enough written about after he came home. The characters just seemed too vague. It's a good read if you just want a lot of 'heat' but there was very little to go off of for a storyline.,"Denise Agnew knows how to write hot, military men and this book is no exception. The communication in the form of letters between Eve and Sean add to their chemistry and elevate the sexual tension to flaming intensity. MALE CALL has all elements of a fun, sexy book that will keep you wanting more. Fortunate for Denise Agnew fans, there are more books in the Hot Zone series. I recommend MALE CALL and the other books in the series. You will not be disappointed.","Wow, what a fun little novella! Eve begins to write to a (male) friend from work, who is now a soldier in Iraq. The letters pick up the heat with each back and forth, until they are dying for each other. More happens, of course, which I won't give away. This was a warm, funny, and touching story about two people who once took each other for granted, now connecting through a long-distance relationship. Sean's letters are intense, hot, and heartbreaking. As a person who has experienced a similar situation, I found this story to be just right.","I'll be honest, I got this book as it was free on kindle. I'd never read this author before but decided that the price was right, as it were. I really enjoyed the book. The characters were great and while it's quite short I thought the author did a good job with the pacing of the book. There is a slight ""cheese"" factor but for the price, I say go for it!

I read two others in this series and thought this one was the best. I will say however that the stories while have differing plots do have some things that repeat. (i.e. a character in the three books I read gets ""bad feelings"" about things, the men are hotties in disguise or they were/are geeky, etc.)",My favorite part of romance is the anticipation. The excruciating build-up that we all feel between the time that we start wanting someone and the time that it happens. That is what makes this book so great!,I'm glad it was free on my Kindle  - I deleted it 1/2 way through. The plot seemed like potential but the whole story was one cliche after another.,"There's no other way to describe the book other then Erotica, its that plan and simple, though this book may be on the tamer side of things its still a cute read. The author used her own way of writing to make a story about a solider and a friend he left behind when he went to Iraq.

Its a fun read that will only take you an hour at most to read, and it tells a good story between a solider and his love","As a military spouse I found the book similar to what I have gone through in the early part of Iraqi Freedom.  While it was kind of like reading someone's mail sent to his girlfriend, it brought back memories.  I enjoyed it.  I do see however, that it is not for everyone, so you might not like it.  It's also on the short side.  But at it's price, I feel it would be a safe bet that you would not feel jipped by taking a chance on it.","Yes, much of this story (as with others in the Hot Zone series) is superficial and silly - old fashioned letter writing, suddenly falling in love with the computer geek from work, the entire scene at the male strip club, etc. But, that's kind of the fun of these stories. Personally, I'm a sucker for a hot military hero or cowboy romance, and Male Call (despite the awful pun) reeled me in. For an hour or so worth of reading, this story is definitely enjoyable.","This was a fun read, but don't expect anything other than that.  It was is very short so if you have an hour or two to kill.  But this will probably leave you rolling your eyes at the end for how cheesy the ending is....","I have gotten some good books for free for my Kindle so I decided it would be good to try Male Call. I am sad to say I am very disappointed. It is extremely smutty and the use of fowl language is horrible. I believe the author didn't spend enough time on creating a history for the characters and you are just thrown into what feels like the middle of a book. This book is so short, I read it on my lunch hour start to finish (after skipping about what felt like 20 pages of smut) Not good... But I guess if you like smut, this would be a good read.",This is a cute little quick and I mean quick story. The plot or concept are 2 people writing each other and falling in love.  i must admit in the beginning the author includes the letters that they are writing each other.  For me it got a little annoying but it doesn't matter. Sean was crazy sexy and I loved Eve's personality. If you are the type that wants to feel connected to the characters on some deep level then this might not be for you as it's fast paste. The sex is a thumps up it was quick but still a thumps up.,If a reader wants lots of sex in a very short book this is just the thing.  But if you are looking for plot or characterization this does not satisfy.,The writing left a bit to be desired. Seemed more like it was written by a teenager trying to be grown.  Not my favorite and I caught myself rolling my eyes quite a few times.,"I enjoy when the main characters have a long history together.  This was the case in this novel.  I also enoyed the correspondence (through the use of letters) between the main characters.  It was a nice way to communicate the story in the first third of the novel.  With that being said, this novel added nothing else new to the romance genre.  The plot was a bit predictable and the ending was (as always) wrapped up perfectly in a nice neat bow.  Not too realistic.  But if you are looking for an easy beach read, this one is for you!","This short military romance story, Male Call, was predictable but enjoyable. The letters the characters write to each other helped move the story along.",short story with a lot of sex. seems a bit immature. needs more to the story about when he comes back home.,"the book brings fun to readers, at a good price, but the plot is short and deals with a lot of sexual content.",
B000WCWUWM,"This turned out to be my favorite story in the anthology,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hearts-from-the-Ashes/dp/159998346X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hearts from the Ashes</a>.  I found the idea of an alpha and omega werewolf romance to be refreshing.  Yes, Laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story - but, I like yaoi.  He is a little effeminate, which may seem stereotypical, but there are men like this. Certainly not all gay men, or even all ""bottoms.""  Yet, I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong, handsome men either - why aren't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical? Because this is a fantasy romance not real life!  Laney's clumsiness is a little over the top, but his relationship with Dev is sweet and hot.  I would have liked the characters to be more developed, but this is a short story not a novel.  Langley sets the stage for her ""With or Without"" werewolf series, which gets more depth in the next two novels.

Overall, I have enjoyed everything from this author, especially the werewolves.  Check out the next two:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Without-Reservations/dp/1599983478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Without Reservations</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/With-Caution/dp/B000ZKECCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">With Caution</a>. Highly recommended.","I absolutely love the ""funny"" werewolves of J.L. Langley. After Without Reservation, here it is With Love: Dev is a strong werewolf who arrives to Asheville for business. Like every good werewolf he wants to meet the local Alpha to give his respect to the leader. But the local alpha is a really piece of shit: when he meets him the alpha is trying to rape Lainey, an omega werewolf. So Dev saves Lainey only to find that he is his mate.

Lainey is a little tiny beautiful man with red hair and amber eyes and with a propension for making trouble. But he is also an eager puppy in bed and Dev likes him very much, so does it matter if he will spend his life to take off from troubles his mate?

Here, like in the other books of J.L. Langley, the humor is a main aspect of the novel. She has a way to make you happy and to leave you with a smile in your face and also eager to read more. I can't wait to read the next enstallment in this wonderful series.",I love  this story an  the author is amazing however I liked the second book better. Loved it though awesome purchase,"I like the series, but the Lainey character is just TOO out and about for me....waaay too much of a clutz..lol","The story is really simple, and feels really forced and doesn't flow naturally scene to scene. A lot of explaining and not much actual drama or action, like the romantic scenes were written first and the rest as added as a ""connect the dots"" later.","I don't know whether this is Langley's first book but it sometimes seemed that way to me when I read the book. The plot is pretty fast and sometimes gives you the impression of watching an episode of a soap opera. Of course as the wolf-enthusiast that I am I know that the behavior of the werewolves as well as their social structure is not really lupine but they are not wolves after all although they refer to themselves as such. The sex scenes are ok but this dominance stuff pretty much ruined them for me. In addition the whole 'mate'-topic is kind of like a fairy coming along and casting a love-spell on the two main characters since I don't get what it is they see about each other. Not only is one much younger than the other, it is more as though the younger and extremely clumsy one needs a guardian and not a 'mate'. It lets you wonder whether these two would have had a relationship without the whole 'mate'-thing. All in all the book is rather average at best and there are definitely better ones.","I accidentally read the second book in this series first and I have to say that I liked it better.  There was more to it.  The author really has talent when she takes the time to expand.  One thing that I found oddly creepy and curious was that Devlin is a name I have used for gaming avatars and as a pseudonymn before and Laine is totally the type of guy I dig.  J.L., have you been reading my journal?  LOL...  Really though these books helps to melt my icy heart and believe in romance again.","Langley never fails to deliver. I love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases. Dev is a reluctant hero, rising to the occasion to save his mate, Lainey, from an abusive alpha. Lainey is a spunky, cute, klutz who keeps his handsome mate, and the reader, laughing and groaning in turns at his antics. This fast-paced, sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. This one has a permanent place on my reader, because once wasn't enough.","After reading the sample for this I was disappointed by the rest of it. It seemed like there would be more mature writing and a deeper plot. However, the plot is rather simple and most of the characters feel two dimensional and at times almost annoying. Laine and one of the other characters in particular were weak characters. The focus on them was mainly on them being clumsy and I would say immature. Now while this can be a part of a character, no one is perfect after all, there was no depth added to make that clumsy characteristic endearing or to show that Laine could act like more than a teenager. At least the book had more than sex and there was plot progession, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy this story, even for the cheap price. It's short and doesn't really make the reader feel any emotion.","I thought this was a quick read. Or perhaps I liked it soo much, I was able to read it fast. It only took me a few hours if that. It was pretty face paced. I hope to see more of Dev and Laine. I enjoyed it. It jumped right into the action and didn't slow down.

Dev is new to town. He and his best friend Cole(and his mate Caroline) are going to be relocating for work. Dev stumbles upon a the local pack assualting there Omega. He get angry and goes to recue him. Laine, the local Omega and doesn't have a filter on his mouth. He says what is on his mind. Both to their joy, they realized early on in the book they are destined to be mates. When the local pack Alpha continues to torment Laine, Dev has to decide what he will do to proctect his new lover/mate.","This book is so bad it's totally funny.  Take a standard old style Harlequin plot, change the heroine to another male, but don't change the dialogue or even the endearments.  Add in a couple of inconsistent werewolf details, and there you go.....a book.  Sort of.

So bad it left me giggling.","I like this type of story were love conquers all and in the end the bad guy gets what he deserves. Laine and Devlin are mates which is only discovered after Devlin saves Laine from being beaten up and raped by his Alpha pack leader. Devlin and his business partner are moving the company to a new city. Devlin is sent to scout out a new location for their company but in the interim he also try to connect with the pack in that city. Unfortunately the pack leader is a cruel and unfair ruler who has his eyes set on Devlin's newly discovered mate, Laine. Needless to say but there will be a change in leadership.","This whole ""instantly recognizing your mate"" thing -- I TOTALLY LOVE THAT! And the eyes and teeth ""shifting"" when emotions run high, very cool!! If you like the genre, you'll like this: family, loyalty, friends, and of course love and romance -- what's not to like? Throw in some decent wolf action, and bam! you've got a story. What I particularly liked about this one is that the couple is decided really quickly at the beginning. There are plenty of stories out there where you've got no idea until 6 pages from the end if the couple's even going to work or not, if the two guys even feel the same way about each other or not. This story's not about that. It's more about how to work together to solve a big problem - the Alpha - and I enjoyed it.","I read the first story in this series and thoroughly enjoyed it. I went on a buying spree and got the other two as well as this short story. I suppose Laine's antics were meant to be comedic relief but I did not laugh not once. His antics were not funny. I did not buy Devlin being so amused by Laine's antics.

I was shocked with how they resolved the conflict with Victor. I thought it was a weak plot point. This story was just ok. I wouldn't recommend anyone spending the money to buy it. If it were free, then yes.","It was an OK read. It didn't flow well for me and a lot of it seemed forced. I liked the plot and most of the characters, though Lainey was annoying after a while",a simple and fast paced book with interesting characters. it takes readers on a journey about wolves and love.,"the book is decent, with a simple storyline and the characters are well written. however, even though it's a quick read it lacks details.","a basic and simple love story to read. characters are very likable, besides lainey, she is a little bit to much.",
B0018969BG,"Bought this initially with my Motorola v3m 2 years back - never had any problems with it- my friends couldn't tell if I was talking on the bluetooth or not. However, it does not work well with my new blackberry storm for some reason.","This is a cheap little headset, but it's very comfortable and so long as it isn't windy, I have yet to have someone tell me they can't hear me.","Don't buy the H500, go for the H700.

I was so excited to get this earpiece.  Even happier when I tried to make a call and it sounded clear as a bell.  Then, my first call... the friend on the other end couldn't hear me for all the static.  My end was still clear. Hung up and called another friend, same thing, then another, same static on their end.

I tried calling motorola and the automated system couldn't understand my yes & no comments because of all the static.  Here again, my end was perfectly clear.  Once I actually talked to a live person at Motorola she asked me to get off the headset so we could talk.  Of course I accidentally hung up on her and had to go thru the whole process again.

I borrowed my friends H700 (which I recommend) and no problems on either end of the conversation!  It's been great!","I ordered Fire Red and received burgandy/maroon, but I needed it and didn't want to wait. It was easy to pair with my Blackberry Curve, but stopped working after 2 weeks. Motorola is sending me a replacement and they were very nice.","This is a nice headset,works well with my Nokia N70, got it for a decent price. This particular color is in Motorola retail packaging so more reliable than bulk packaging. Slightly heavy but overall quite good.","This is one of the easiest bluetooth, I thought I was going to have to go through all these complicated steps to hook it up to my cell phone and computer, I was shocked how easy it was, took me minutes and it was doing it's thing. I don't honestly know how I lived without this, I use Skype and often times get tangled in my headset, now its just so easy, works just like my cell phone, but FREE I make all my international calls free, I would HIGHLY advise getting this bluetooth, it literally changed the way I do business. I will be purchasing several more for gifts, and my children. I was shocked at the price I saw the EXACT same bluetooth for $59.99 I was skeptical but it came in the factory package, just like in the store, and I received it in 2 days. Never will I buy retail again.","There is a buzzing sound on the other end w/ the blackberry 8220 which is the flip for the T-Mobile.  My end sounds fine.  Also the fit is terrible I agree w/ the others it falls off if I mess w/ my hair or fix my glasses.  It works in the car as it should and that is all.

M T Bishop","I live by a cellphone. I am a security officer and drive a patrol cart. Having a cellphone up to your ear is not acceptable at post. All officers are allowed to wear bluetooths. I had the exact same model about 3 years ago and fell in love with it.  I have very small ears and any bluetooth that goes in my ear hurts because it pushes on the walls of my ear and leaves bruises.  I was very limited with my usage.  This bluetooth lays against your ear and has a nice speaker.  It is very light weight making it a pleasure to wear. The best feature (other than not being in my ear) is the discreet mode.  You can turn off the blue light when calls come in so that no one knows you are on a call. (other than the fact that you look like you are talking to yourself). I have had 4 different bluetooths through a 4 year period and of them only the Motorola has done a great job. I have had a Sony Ericcson, Plantronics, and a Jabra.","The sound quality and look is great, BUT the fit is AWFUL.  This bluetooth only has one fit feature, changing it from the left ear to the right.  Otherwise you are on your own.  I couldn't even move my head without it falling off.  It literally just hooks onto the ear.  It just hangs there.  It doesn't contour to the ear at all.  This one is not worth the money.  I used this maybe one day and ended up buying something else.",The fire red really is a sharp looking maroon that fits my right ear perfectly and gives a clear sound when I listen or speak.  Well worth the price. I accidentally ruined the first one I had as a gift (washing)that cost my daughter over $30 (same model). I could not be more pleased with the product or the service. Order came quickly and was well packaged.,"I only use this while driving, but it works well and serves its purpose.  You can't beat the price!",I was very excited to find this bluetooth.  I bought the same one in red from Target and lost it.  I haven't been able to find this style anywhere.  I just got a new phone in this wine/maroon color family and it was the perfect fit.  The price of 15.00 made it worth the deal.  Great buy on the H500!!! Very pleased with the fast shipping.,It is a nice headset for the price. It isn't real loud so if you have a noisy car/truck this might not be your best choice. But for the occasional user like me...it is good.,This headset is barely usable. The earhook is huge and there is nothing to keep the headset close to your ear.  The device dangles precariously and falls off my ear simply from the movement of my jaw when speaking.,I used this bluetooth everyday for about a month before the button would no longer work.  This is the same problem I had with the last one I had.  Then it stopped connecting to my phone all together.  Would not recommend if you are going to use it multiple times a day every day.,"the product is a bluetooth headset targeted toward use in hands-free calling. it was found to be easy to setup and use and matched favorably when compared against other similar products. however, it garnered some criticism over having low audio quality.","This bluetooth device has a reasonable price that most people can afford. It does however, hang off of your ear and can fall off while speaking. There can be some static depending where you are at the moment. The overall quality by most customers consider this a great  and useful item to have.",This is a comfortable headset. It is not compatible with all devices. It is easy to connect. The contour to the ear could be better. It is affordable and nicely packaged. The light can be turned off when in use.,
B001AS6J24,"I ordered this case as a preventative from damage I may cause on the phone (I'm pretty accident prone). While it doesn't match the color of the phone exactly, it's good enough. I'm pretty impressed.",The case is cheaply made and offers mininmal protection. But that is what you get for a minimal price.,"I bought this item for my env2 phone since the silicone one from the verizon store collected lint and kept sliding off. It has worked well for me so far, but as the other reviews said it is difficult to get off. On the bright side, the color off the case is VERY close to that of the phone itself. The rubber texture also makes sure it doesnt fall out of your pocket or hand. For the price this is an amazing cover!","I purchased the ""Rubberized Hard Plastic Cover"" for my LG-ENV2 because it was sliding all over on the dash the center console so I thought the ""Rubber"" on the hard plastic would stop that from happening but yep you guessed it it still slides all over except when trying to get out of my cargo pants pocket where it sticks like crazy.  Oh well for the price I got a cover that matches the color of my phone pretty darn close at least, maybe I will find one that does not slide until then I continue to chase the phone or leave it in my pocket.",The product EASILY got scrathed. Every tiny thing showed up and is very easy to crack. Would not suggest it to anyone.,Its a good case I give it a three only thing is the paint scratchs off real easy but still good for the phone,"The rubberized case stays on very well. It's acutally hard to take off the phone. The red color goes really good with the marroon phone. The only thing I didn't like is the clip on the back. the clip screws on to the back thru the square hole, but mine keeps unscrewing itself and it stands out too far if you wear it. For the price it was a good deal. I plan on getting a leather case for it to go into. It fits well in the leather cases with the plastic case on it.",I love this cover.  It is big enough to protect the phone yet thin enough to fit in my phone case.  I wish I had bought this as soon as I purchased my phone.  I cannot say enough about this cover.  It is just what every ENV2 owner needs to protect their phone!,"This cover is awesome.  It is the exact color of the actual phone, most people can't tell there is a cover on it.","For a few bucks I was impressed with the fit and finish. The color was similar and IMO slightly better than the Maroon Env2 I bought it for. I was concerned it was going to look like some 'cheap plastic' red, but it has an unusually deep rich red just slightly more towards plum than red compared to the env2's maroon. The only slight problem I noticed it that there is a small square in the center back, below the camera hole that is very slightly protruding from the otherwise flat surface. Amazingly the phone balances perfectly on this subtle bump and I can only imagine that perhaps it is there so that if the phone is on vibrate and sitting on your desk it has a more obvious movement to draw attention to itself ?!?","I was excited about receiving this phone cover.  I am fond of red, my phone is black, problem solved (I thought).  I was happy to find this product.  I was particularly happy about the fact that it was ""rubberized"".
I was really careful with my phone because I was so happy with the cover (at first).  Normal activity of sliding the phone in and out of my belt case (for work) rubbed the red coating off leaving bare metal exposed.  Needless to say it looked really bad.  Rubberization---Great concept.  It just needs improved durability.",Sorry it took so long.  I am so very happy with the cell phone cases I purchased.  They fit perfectly and the price OMG you cannot beat that. Thanks so much will shop again.,"This case might fit the phone nicely, but it isn't painted all the way around.  When the cover is on my phone and I open it you can see the white plastic that should have been painted.  I've had cases that were white on the underside of the case that is hidden when attached to the phone, but this one looks cheap.  I do not recommend.",This case for my new ENV 2 phone is really close to the right color.  Hardly able to tell the difference.  I would have liked the outside screen to be protected but for some reason that's not an option on any case I have found so far.  Warning....once you put it on it's really difficult to get off the phone.  But it really does the job in a inexpensive and stylish way.,I'm a little klutzy and scratched up my phone a bit so I bought this cover to make it look new again.  I knew for the price it might not be the highest quality but it was worse than I expected.  The red did not match my phone and the color scraped off very easily by just being in my purse.  The annoying part is I paid about as much in shipping as I did for this really cheap cover.,inexpensive phone cover that that stays on the phone. color is close to the phone color but scratches off easily.,this affordable case has a nice rubber texture and comes with a clip on the back. the color is well matched to the phone but the color can wear off. it fits well to the phone but can be hard to remove.,The case fits the phone perfectly and color scheme is perfectly matching. The Rubberization is protective,
B001B4AAJ0,"Appears to be a nice slim case. However, the coating on the case chips easily. This only appears to compromise the aesthetic quality but not the protective quality of the case.

The included screen protector impedes the touch response more so than other screen protectors that I have used. But that's an easy thing to switch out.","I like this case, but it's not overwhelming.  I'm a little paranoid about scratching the phone, so I like feeling of protection I get from it.

The two main things that keep it from getting five stars from me are the fit and the included screen protector.

Neither one is all that bad.  But as others have mentioned, there are gaps between the halves of the case, and the screen protector does have some strange bubbles under it.

It's fine for now, but I'm going to look for something better.","Positives- Its a great looking case. I love the feel and texture of it. Best looking case out there in my opinion and also comes with a clear film to protect the screen

Negatives- Putting on the film and case at the same time is a very difficult and tedious task. Unless you have your own screen protector, the process may take a while since the film isn't sticky. It also bubbles alot and it took me forever to apply it bubblefree. The case also does not fully close. I put it on properly but there is still space at all four corners. The spaces are pretty small though and not that much of a big deal to me. Have to wait until the first drop to see whether the case hugs it as tight as it does.

Overall im happy about how the case looks and feels. The screen protector is garbage and the case could have been made better to fit the phone.",The second i put this case on it scratched my phone and not just alittle scratch a deep one. It also dose not even fit right.,"I chose this case because of the looks and the slim unobtrusive feel.  I've had it on the phone since the date is was purchased (for a total of about 6 months now), and my iphone has scratches on the chrome trim and small scratches on the back side. Not real happy about that. I cant comment on the included screen protector, i used another instead.","The back and top covers help in protecting the sides and back. The screen supplied with the case is terrible. Due to the way the covers fit together, they make the screen almost jam onto the iphone screen. This made the phone hang, because it seemed to be unsure whether my phone was still stuck to my ear or not. Additionally, bubbles and moisture formed under the screen. And, yes, it was a bit complicated to get the covers to fit together. For those who are color-conscious, although the description indicates that it's black, it's really transparent instead of what I hoped would be a cool-looking black. Since I will need to buy another screen (probably from the Apple store) - maybe the type that sticks to the iphone screen, rather than the hard plastic given with the Griffin, it makes the price of protecting my phone more than I thought when I found this product on amazon. Why haven't I rated it 1 star? At least, the back of the phone (which is probably protected by the metal) is covered and won't scratch - not that it looks very classy through the transparent plastic/silicone - which you don't want happening with the great-looking iphone.","This case was recommended to me by a friend.  They love theirs, but I deeply regret my purchase.

The case would be perfect, if not for the fact that it had one chip in the rubbery plastic of the back by the end of the first day it was on the iphone, and several days latter, there are several pits and chips.  The inside of the plastic is much different than the outside, making each defect that much more noticeable.

I bought this case because it covered up the edge between the iphone and the iphone screen.  It does that.

But it is getting deeper pits, and more chips the longer I use it.  As I keep my iphone in a very small purse that only contains my bus pass and my leather credit card/id holder - I can't even imagine what is causing the chips and pits.

I have another case, that does not cover screen edge - which I used for a month before purchasing this one.  That case is as pristine as the day I bought it.",My only complaint is that the top cover has some sort of film that peels off a little piece at a time.,"I was nervous to buy this case because of the negative reviews on here. But I gambled on the positives and have not been disappointed.

Pluses:
- Great looking case, the Wave design is cool looking. I also like that the back is semitransparent so you can see the apple logo.
- Fits the iPhone tightly, not sure what the issue is with people not being able to put it together right. Just follow the instructions, and it fits perfectly.
- Not bulky at all, the phone does not feel much bigger at all with it on
- Provides a much needed grip. Before, I always felt a bit that the phone was about to shoot out of my hand if I squeezed too tight. This case provides enough grip in your hand, but it is not tacky/sticky plastic or rubber, so it does NOT get stuck in your pocket.

Negatives:
- Yes, the included screen protector is terrible. Do not use it. However, this does NOT detract from the rest of the case, it looks and works fine without the screen protector.

If you must have a screen protector, just buy one separately that got good reviews. Buy this for the excellent case.","I loved the case when I first got it.  It was a little tricky to get on, but anyone with an IQ better than an 8 year old's will get the hang of it after a couple of tries.  Anyways, the case is super protective, but the silicone ""frosting"" started to peel off immediately and has continued to worsen throughout the past month.  It is especially bad on the edges.  I wouldn't buy another one like it, but I don't hate it enough to drop another $34.","i must have bought over 10 different covers for my phone (griffin, belkin, etc) and i have to say this is the best because it protects the corners as i tend to drop my phone...  the others just clip on but doesn't wrap the corners like this one..  i would get this if you are looking for a sturdy case...  the best part, it was under [...] bucks...","This is a great case as long as you do NOT use the included screen protector.  Go out and get yourself an anti-glare screen protector and put that on first.  Then put the case on.  Make sure you put the case on correctly!  I have seen so many people use this case incorrectly.  If the flaps are not tucked over and under the proper places, of course it's going to look funny.

One problem...The finish on the back of my case started peeling.  I called Griffin and they sent me out a new one within days at no charge to me at all.  It was so easy!!

Looks great.  Very sleek.  Great Customer Service.  I highly recommend.","The look and feel is good. I like the fact that it came with a screen protector film with the case. However, it is an absolute pain to get it on the phone because of the weird wavy design, atleast it was for me.

Also, after you get it on, over time moisture settles underneath the film and causes weird bubbles.","I've been using the Griffin Wave case on my iPhone 3G for a year, and have just switched it over to my new iPhone 3Gs.

Here's what I love about this case - it's subtle, smooth, provides a slightly tactile feel to the slick iPhone, and it seems indestructible.  I've dropped this case on the floor a half a dozen times this year, and both the case and the phone are just fine.  Every month or two I take the case off and wash it with dish soap and let it dry.  In between, I wipe the phone down with a cloth.

After a year of use, I can say that this is one of the best phone or PDA cases I've ever owned.","The Griffin Wave case is without a doubt very protective, but it has one very serious design flaw.  The rubberized coating, touted all over the box, peels off DAYS after putting the case on.  For me, an entire chunk of the back of the case was missing the coating.  It doesn't hinder its protectiveness, but it makes it feel really slippery, and it looks like crap.",the case is attractive and has a film screen protector which can chip and get bubbles from moisture. the case is rubberized to make gripping the phone easier but the rubber details chip and peel off. the case provides good protection against drops and bumps.,the case doesn't fit right and it causes scratches on the phone but it is protective and subtle,"The case is solid protection, but the outside coating peels very quickly, and the screen protector makes bubbles under it",
B001BB242E,"If you're expecting a full review on the H12, sorry but I didn't get that far.

Amazon shipped me what was clearly a used / returned & broken headset which doesn't seem to fit with my preconceived (and up until now, I thought widely understood) notion of what ""New"" means. In future, I'll be more aware that BULK may mean PREVIOUSLY RETURNED and that as a consequence that it may be more likely to be DoA. You already knew from the bulk packaging that this is not the stuff that gifts are made of; now you know that bulk may mean extra hassle if it needs to be returned.

OK you live and learn.

On the flip side, the H12 return process was simple. Prepaid label in your inbox. OK so it's was a hassle, but Amazon is still a great firm to shop with, so I'll be back.

This is the best headset I've had, though I've only had 3 or 4 others and they all have been Motorola.  Good battery life, excellent clarity and ease of use are the best features.","Thought this was a good deal, but unfortunately the audio was dead on arrival.  It powered up and connected to my cell with no problems, but not a single sounds would come out of the ear piece.  I was dissappointed but Amazon made it very easy to return and even refunded my return shipping, hassle free.  I will think twice about these OEM purchases in the future.","Hey let me just say, that if your looking into buying a bluetooth for yourself, just make sure you do your homework first. I did mine and it turned out for the better cause this headset was perfect and I love amazon cause it was a whole lot cheaper on here and I love the sales. The stylish design is really cool, and if your background music is at a medium level it will cancel it out but let me make sure you know what noise canceling does, it makes it so when you talk on your bluetooth ex: In your car and the music is playing not too loud, it will cancel out the music and let the person on the other end hear you clearly. One thing to know though it hears everything in the background if you stay silent. Other than that I turn my radio down anyway while talking using the bluetooth and its done me  good so far. One more thing before I go it comes with two chargers and a usb cable. A desktop charger and a case to charger, so as I said its good and I reccomend it to anyone.",I had purchase lots of items and this is the first time got this product from Amazon that is not in original packet.  Don't know why they send me in an opening box seem it is already used by other.  But I call customer service and I return this to Amazon.,"I'm so disappointed with Amazon regarding this purchase.  At the time I purchased this as ""new"" and received it in a plastic bag, no box.  Since I had bought this as a gift, I was too embarrassed to give it away, so kept it for myself.  When I finally opened it I was obviously USED.  There was visible residual earwax from the previous user!  I was disgusted!  Then I continue to find that there were no replacement ear cushions and also missing the desk charger.  On top of that, the headset doesn't even work!  Since it's been 30 days since the purchase, Amazon Customer Service will not offer any assistance in correcting this horrible purchase.  Negative 5 stars in my book.","I could be completely satisfied IF my order was complete.
According to the Features and Functions Guide, I should

items were not in the package.",It's a bluetooth headset.  I like the charging module.

Great product, even better price and fast easy delivery. Thanks Guys really good job!","Product is great, works great easy to connect to my blackberry.
I order it becuase my first one (exact model) died when I accidently put it in the washer and dryer.",Cute Bluetooth but folks on receiving end couldn't hear me. I was able to hear fine tho.,The H12 is a classic and good for what it does. It is slick and looks cool and has a nice touch for me. The only thing I don't like is that is is not loud enough sometimes and it dies after 2 hours of talk time. Other thank that worth the price,"This is my second H12, the first one was great, however I don't know how this one passed quality control! The audio is terrible coming and worse going out, I stopped using it...would not recommend this headset.","While I could spend a lot of time talking about what's good about the Motorola H12 the important thing is performance in a noisy environment, and that's not so good. With traffic going by in NYC I couldn't hear a darn thing and my caller couldn't hear me. My car is sporty and noisy; same thing. I also cannot get a good fit with the earpiece. I just do not know why manufacturers do not make headsets like decent canal ear buds. Ok, for the good stuff: the ear loop keeps the headset secure, the on-off switch is positive, the volume control is easy to use, and the magnetic recharge connector is a nice touch.","I was excited to receive this headset and use it on my Droid smartphone, but sadly - it is HORRIBLE!  It literally causes pain to my ear when it is on for more than a few minutes.  The sound quality if AWFUL and you can only hear well if you push the device into your ear.  Bad, bad, bad.  DO NOT RECOMMEND!","the charger which should have come with motorola h12 bluetooth headset is missing in box. the prduct has been already used by other. so this is already used one which is shipped by amazon.at the same time, the return process is simple with amazon. in a few of h12 headsets, there is audio problem found.","the sound quality is not up to par on this bluetooth headset, and the noise canceling feature is not very good either. the price is good, but the quality is questionable.","The Motorola H12 is a bluetooth headset. It has a cool design and the noise cancelling function works perfectly. However, it seems there is a lack of quality control because you can receive either a non functioning or already used headset.

B001E42QBW,"Product does extend the life of the battery significantly. However, the finish wears off and the trim starts coming apart fairly quickly. It happened just a week in to my using the product - and I only use it when necessary. Since these things do not affect the functionality, it is still worth putting up with them for the extended battery life, but it is disappointing after a short time to have a shabby looking item plugged in to such an awesome phone.","If you're frustrated with the battery life on iPhone 3G, this is exactly what you've been looking for.  Never again be stuck in an airport or conference or out on the town with a dead or dying iPhone.  You can even simultaneously sync and recharge the Mophie and your iPhone together so you don't need to bring two cords when you travel.  I love it!

I keep the juice pack with me in my briefcase and use it as a backup when my power is running low.  It at least doubles the time I can go without charging my iphone.  The Juice Pack makes the phone slightly larger, but when you phone is running low on charge, you really don't care.","(Used with 3G S) I was primarily interested in this product as a 'sacrificial' battery to prolong the (alleged) 500-cycle life of the internal iPhone battery, not to extend talk time per se.  I could never get the thing to charge from the (Apple) AC adapter, only from a USB port- tying your 'extra life' to the availability of a computer.  The pack did not run down before the internal battery as advertised by Mophie- it would start out running off the pack, but the use of an app, talking on the phone, or various other activities would inevitably cause it to suddenly switch to the internal battery when the pack had plenty of juice left.  Obviously this rendered it useless for my purpose.  Had high hopes and was therefore extremely disappointed.  This may be more the 'fault' of the phone internals, but if it doesn't work, well, it doesn't work.  I hope it can be improved- physically, it seems very well designed.","Good:This product keeps the iPhone charged for a full day of use and, has a nice weight/feel to it. Bad: Protection on the top is well, bad. Ugly: The  rubber sleeves on each side come off after a month or so. This also happened to my friends.  Product is in need of improvement, especially for $99.","PRO:-doubles battery life, useful during high useage
  -hard case feels substantial and is well designed. unlike most other
  cases, it allows complete use of the screen (2 other cases i have
  limit the functional use at the edge of screen due to case overlap)
  -4 LEDs on back of case provide relative charge status. rechargeable
  via std USB (tops off both 3G and mophie)
CON:-device came drained -vs- juiced (as advertised), recharge was quick
  and uneventful so only mildly disappointed
  -3G iphone treats device as if it were plugged into external power,
  which it is, but this means device continuously drains mophie, even
  in STBY.  you can carry the pack detached but that defeats the
  purpose of having an integrated ext battery/case.
  -hardcase doesn't protect top edge of device

Overall-Highly RECOMMEND despite what are relatively minor issues
  as stated above.  i am hopeful mophie can address the power
  management issue with apple; then, this device would be a 5 star.","I bought this in January 2009.
Everything was great, except for the glue problem you've read about.

But since my IPhone 3G was updated to OS 3.0, the battery pack does not charge the phone.

Correction Aug 02, 2009:
  This was a coincident.
  It turns out that I had a defective Juice Pack!
  Morphie and company honored their 1 yr warranty and paid for shipping!

  I am now upgrading it from a two to a 4 (1 off for the glue problem)

  I now have a brand new fully working Juice Pack!

  Just in case you didn't understand...it was NOT a problem with OS 3.0.",This product has doubled the lofe of my Iphone. I have golfshot GPS on my Iphone and the juice pack has performed extremely well andI never have to worry about the battery running down during a round of golf.,"I haven't had any rubbers issues. After reading these reviews I'm waiting for them.

This thing is GREAT. I can take the phone with a dead battery, plug it in to the juice pack, and watch a movie. When the movie ends the phone battery is fully recharged, and there is still some left in the pack. Sick!

AND, the basic form factor doesn't change. It still fits well in your hand, it still holds well to make a call (better actually because it isn't slippery), still fits in your pocket if you aren't wearing tight pants. Alternatively any time you are sitting somewhere you can be charging the phone, then take the phone off the pack when you're heading out again.

I have a Kensington extra battery that I had before this came out. It connects by a wired. Works, but a constant pain in the butt.","very good at recharging my iPhone.  I am still a little fuzzy if it is the correct one for my 3Gs, Amazon says it is but the packaging stops at 3G.  I am also a little unclear when the phone is runnign off the mophie juice pack or the iPhone battery.  The 4 light battery level indicator only works when there is no phone attached.  It does what I needed, kept me iPhoning during an extended period with no chance to recharge with via outlet or computer.","plenty of juice...that's true

plenty of glue all over your phone, case, hands and clothes as the side grips just fall off this ill manufactured case!

fix it mophie!!!!!","The charging ability is good. However, the device is falling apart. The side grips came off, and I had to glue them back on.","I happened to see this as a Gold box deal and that saved me a whole chunk of money. It is great.  The instructions suck, but that seems to be true of most electronics I buy.  It is a USB type recharger, but the iPhone comes with an adaptor for charging to a standard electrical outlet, so just plug the Mophie cord into that adaptor.  Takes a good long while to fully charge --4 blue lights--but it holds the charge for awhile when not in use (unlike my iPhone).  There's a little button to press that can tell you how much charge you have remaining.  Mine has held the full charge for several days of non use.  Since I just got it a week ago or so, I don't yet know the limits of its holding ability, but I'm already very impressed.","For weeks I thought this was a brilliant accessory. Battery drains first, leaving your phone fully charged. Then you charge the Mophie like a spare battery, which phones used to have.

Once it gets real warm, though, the rubber bumpers on the side start to slide around and come off, leaving a REALLY sticky mess. It IS a real problem, making an otherwise brilliant product very annoying.","This is one of the most disappointing products ever. Sometimes it charges and works perfectly as designed and sometimes the iPhone gives you an error message.  You have to basically leave this thing on all the time? Or you have to remove it from the iPhone to ""reset"" it.  Not worth the money. I bought 2 of these things and both of them exhibit the same behavior on the 3GS.","Customers are generally happy with the battery life, it is very convenient to reach, although some complain that they get an error message on the iphone when connecting the charger, there are also complaints that it gets too hot.",The battery in the iPhone is very well made which can be charged in a very short period of time while talking on the phone or various functions will inevitably cause a sudden switch to the interior but the battery backup works properly without consuming too much battery while talking,the juice pack is great for iphone charging on low battery when you are out. it can get a bit hot with extended use and it can fall apart easily.,
B001HVWUDG,"Distorted audio out, buzzing on recieve on I Phone and LG.
925 and 920 are very good. 835 very bad.","I already own one of these and wanted another for back up when I go on trips and are away from methods to charge it. The noise level is low to none and the incoming speech is crystal clear. I love that I don't need to keep looking, ""This is it! The price is awesome!","I bought this primarily because the price was very attractive (15 dollars).  The biggest issue I have is that there is no on/off indicator.  The on/off button is the same and one never knows easily if the device is on or off.  The documentation everywhere completely omits reference.  Called Plantronics and they kept insisting that a blue light should display when on; they shipped me a new product twice.  Both times the product behaved the same - which was frustrating.  I think this is the design and I will not contact plantronics anymore.  Otherwise, the product works fine and sound quality is good.  Worth the price I paid.","Over the years, I've had several bluetooths, all of which were Plantronics.  I was very happy with each and every single one of them.  (I would need a new one because I would lose it, or the dog would chew it up on several occasions.) I found a deal on this one, and I went for it, expecting the same quality as the other Plantronics.  Unfortunately, I'm not very happy with this one.  Although the design physically isn't bad, the actual device hold up to par with other bluetooths (blueteeth?, haha!).  The main concerns are that I sound muffled to the person that I'm on the phone with and the volume to hear the other person doesn't go very high.  Then, there are little things here and there where there is brief static sounds, my bluetooth will disconnect itself once in while but that might be my phone, although I haven't had that trouble before, and I personally just don't like the plastic part that holds the bluetooth to the ear.",Plantronics Voyager 835 Bluetooth Headset received timely. Device only functioned for two weeks. Future electronic purchases will be done at a store where the warranty would be honored.,Excellent....much better than the cheaper versions of the same thing by the same manufacturer...works simply and well...holds a charge well.,"Pros: lightweight, good reception both ways--I hear clearly and others hear me clearly.
Cons: The indicator light to turn the headset on and off is directly below your thumb whenever you are pressing the button, so it's hard to tell when the device actually turns on or off. The ear piece does not fit snug into my ear, so the whole headset is kind of floppy on my ear (I am about 6'3"" and 210lbs, so my ears might be a little bigger than average???). Volume is WAY TOO LOW. Read the other reviews--it is nearly impossible to listen to someone on the other end if you are in a noisy environment.

I would recommend this device but I would definitely explain the above precautions first.","This product does not work with a higher pitched voice.  I can not use it when I am outside as it won't pick up my voice when I'm talking.  When I am inside, people say I sound muffled and it doesn't sound like me at all. Also the ear hook is plastic so it won't bend, and it hurt my ear. So, I gave this thing away to a male, and I bought a jawbone with works great!","Good volume and clarity for the user. Those called have reported that the sound quality is good. Always seems like a bit of a job getting it plugged into my ear. I wonder if one-size-fits-all is really practical considering you are inserting something semi-into your ear, but I suppose if it works for me............. The idea behind the in-car charger totally eludes me. With some previous Plantronics ear pieces the ear piece was inserted down into the charger device which was then plugged into the car. Great program. With this version the charger is tipped with a ""micro"" male fitting (like on the tip of your finger) and the female fittig is in the end of the ear piece which is then plugged onto the male fitting and the ear piece just wiggles and jiggles out on the end. Ridiculous. How is that supposed to work? Don't plan on charging it while the vehicle is moving and don't slam the door getting out if it's parked. On the other hand I guess it's nothing a little duct tape wouldn't take care of. Good grief.",I purchased the Plantronics 835 bluetooth with noise cancelling features about a month....yada yada yada...and I have not used it after the first week!!  I find that has very poor volume on every call that I used it for and felt that I was constantly pressing the unit into my ear to even hear the person on the line.  Point blank this unit needs to be $5.99 with free shipping for those who want to take their chances.  LOL.  It was a bad choice for me and I have gone back to my older bluetooth unit even with the broken over the ear clip.  The 835 has a good price but not worth it.,I bought this to replace a Motorola Bluetooth and found I didn't care for the shape or the bulky feeling when I used it.  It did work OK but kept falling away from my ear.,"I bought this because i broke off the jack plug on my wired headset, and this one was recomemnded for use with the Dell Venue Pro. It works well, but the clarity is not so good for the people on the other end of the call. Also its clumsy to fit to your ear in a hurry, so keep it on.",really thought this would be a great headset because of the dual mics. the problem is that i can barely hear the person on the other end. even with the volume all the way up its almost like a loud whisper.,"This is my first Plantronics headset and I expected more due to the great reviews from my Plantronics-owner peers.  I've been through the Jawbone, Gennum, LG, Motorola and Sound ID headsets.  The Voyager 835 got great reviews on CNET.com and I did my homework with the technology, but I would rate this headset as average.  The clarity of incoming voices is above average, but soft.  My voice is muffled on the receivers' end.  There is minor static that I first noticed during the silence of being put on hold; but now I am aware of it all the time.  Volume definitely needs to be louder.  Conversation is fine in quiet indoor environments, but I bought this noise-cancelling, wind-stopping headset for practical reasons.  The noise-cancelling and wind-stopping technology is good for the person I'm talking to; however, I keep having to ask them to repeat themselves because I cannot hear them in windy or environments with a lot of background noise.  The usable range that the phone can be away from the headset is poor.  Have it on opposite sides of your body and the static is deafening.  It's a fairly inexpensive headset, so I guess you get what you pay for.","Overall this headset gets the job done if you need both hands, but it doesn't go above or beyond a low budget headset. If you are looking for quality, this is not the headset you need. If you just need a cheap headset, there are many out there with the same quality and much less expensive. Stay clear from this one.","the headset arrives with a dual mic and the income speech is clear. the products hold the charge well. however, they have a few problems with the materials, which can hurt the ear if they don't fit perfectly.",useful bluetooth headset at an affordable price. it lets you be hands free and accomplish everything that you need to while getting work/personal life done at the same time.,the headset has an excellent price point and good sound quality. the volume of calls can be too low and the fit is awkward for some wearers.,
B001MYLTDA,For people who want a device that is a computer in their pocket this is the right device for you. For those of you who aren't comfortable with computers and there make-up and don't know how to customize things to your liking on a windows mobile device than this device is not for you. The great thing about windows mobile is there are so many customizable options you have out there and the programs you can install are limitless. If you don't like how a certain program functions install a different one. There are tons of custom rom's (operating systems) You can install to turn this machine into a beast that cannot be touched by any other phone out there today.,"Never dropped it, kept a protective rubber cover on it & only used it for calls & texting(by the way, there is a delay in texting which is frustrating.) Stored a few pics but never used pic. mail. After only 4 months, it failed to start up this morning. Took it for diagnostic test & was told I need a new phone but they didn't tell me what caused it to kill over. My replacement phone should arrive in 3-4 days but I hope that it is not a lemon as well. The guy @ Sprint told me they get alot of Lotus phones in for repairs.(not good)","Ok I have gotten into the world of PPC's with a real old model,

This is by far the best phone, and the wife loved it so much she had to get it.  Now for thoose not used to a ppc it might feel a bit clunky with the interface, but do to all it can do it will.

I will say battery life could be better, although there are registry tweaks and such that greatly help ([...]).  There are certain programs to help with the TF3D feel.  Overall I highly recomend this to someone with the need and use for a powerfull phone, and business use.
Dave",This is a terrible phone for a man to try to use.  the keyboard is too small.  the smart keys try to do too much for you and you end up calling people you never intended.  I hate it.,"This thing has a great keyboard.  Buttons are slightly raised for nice tactile feedback.  Easier to use than you'd think, even with the strange shape. It's short, but wide, which is perfect.  Actually ditched my last phone because I love this one so much.

If you are looking to simplify your life, this is a good phone.  If you are somebody who uses some features rarely, like Web, email, or GPS, there is no need to carry around a big smartphone.  This has those features and they work great.  Wouldn't want to use them on here all the time, but for somebody like me who just uses it to phone and text, it works great.  Camera is also nice.  Much better than other phones I have used.  Up there with my Nikon and Fuji digital cameras.

This phone is not for everybody.  It's takes a bit getting used to when you hold it, since it is so wide.  If you can get around that though, It think you'll like it.  I know I did.","I've been an user of cell phones from a long time ago, and I owned 6 different brands (Siemens, Nokia, HTC, Hyundai, Motorola & Sony Ericcson), and I got a new offer from my cell phone operator giving me this Blackberry. So far, after one month using it, I can't be more surprised (and pleased) of the capabilities and the functioning of the cell phone. I highly recommend this Blackberry.","The phone is great but I was a little disapointed that it did not have picture mail.  When sending text messages sometimes its a bit slow, but I love the phone.","Powerful phone but somewhat problematic.
Not as easy to use as I had expected.
Complaint from people I talk to about poor sound quality.
I did not have this issue with previous phone and different service.
Short battery life.
You need to purchase a copy of Microsoft Outlook ($85)to us all features.
Sprint service very average in my area, there are better choices.
Denied my rebate even though everything was in order.
I'm still trying to work through that issue.","I bought this phone on 12/26/08 and less than 8 weeks later it stopped working.  I took it into a Sprint store and they told me many people have the same computer issue...BUT it was over 30 days, so I had to send it to LG.  LG then told me I had to ship it to them...and pay for the tracking/packaging/shipping/insurance and the plan while they send me a refurbished phone in two weeks.  I bought a new phone and will receive a used phone back.  I was VERY disappointed with Sprint and LG, but felt trapped to fix this problem.","I go my LG Lotus about 3 or 4 weeks ago. I used one in the store and I liked the cool design and it's features. also it has gmail which not many phones have. i think the qwerty keyboard is pretty easy to type on and i like that. also it has internet which is also good. the internet is kinda slow but its a phone so what should i expect, its a phone?the other downside is it doesn't always show the whole screen. but it's okay. i like that its flip and qwerty key board. also i like the pictures and videos i can make with it. also the camera buton on the side makes everything easier. its kinda slow but it amkes up for it. i have the red one which the don't sell on amazon but the red one has an amazing design and i'm glad i got this phone.","I balked at the form factor at first but after checking out the cnet review I wanted to check it out in person. Went to a nearby sprint store and still thought it looked funny but the functionality of this phone is sick! Gps, email, texting, internet, phone - it gives my wife's blackberry curve some serious competition. And the menus and options for every feature are very well thought out and executed. Give this one a serious look even if your friends make fun of you for having a 'chick phone'. I've even grown to like the chunkiness of it.","This phone is kind of a piece of junk. My daughter has went thru 3 of them with SPRINT, it has a problem of turning itself off and on for no reason at all. Plus, it loses its signal quite often and we live in a decent sized METRO area. It is ok, I guess, if you get it for free, but don't pay for it if you are looking for a replacement.","Amazon and Sprint, please get your act together!

The ad says that the phone will be free after mail-in rebate when purchased with a phone plan. I paid Amazon the 49.99 and submitted the mail-in form for a rebate of 50.00. When the rebate was denied, I called Sprint and they said Amazon had given the 50.00 rebate at the time of purchase - so that the price of the phone is really 49.99.","I recently switched from a traditional cell phone to this phone because of the reportedly good web experience. It does have a good web expereince, but alas I miss having a phone. This is a warning to all you ""phone only"" users wanting to transcend to a higher plain...this might not be the one for you.
Pro: fast internet and good browser experience
Cons: weak battery and clumbsy phone interface.

Short story: this device is less of a phone and more of a very small computer. Still bleeding edge in IMHO.","1. Locks up very frequently
2. Multiple touches needed to execute commands
3. Not intuitive
4. Mysterious error messages
5. Scrolling through emails is impossible. It keeps opening them when you're just trying to scroll.
6. Deleted photos for no reason
7. Depletes battery life quickly some days for no reason
8. Settings change for no reason
Don't buy this phone!!!!","phone is good for business use, but not everyday use. it has little buttons on the keyboard, that make it hard for some people to type with. short battery life. phone doesn't last that long.","this phone has a lot of capabilities almost as if it a minicomputer. however, it is a small device suitable for women due to its button arrangement. the has a lot of great features including a really great camera but yet it seems to be not so rugged or resilient.","this is a powerful phone with many features that will appeal to technology enthusiasts. however, it is not the most reliable device and many of the features can be difficult to use. it may not be the ideal device for someone who wants something minimalist and reliable.",
B001N48GGC,Doesn't sound like the original version of the song. But still is good is a good version of the song.,"This is not the version of this song that I wanted and it is very flat and boring.

The music track is spot-on.  Vocals are close.  Close your eyes, squint  a tiny bit, then enjoy.",will not pay piss me of so i had to buy a vh one eighties cd  would of gave no stars,"Not much else to say. If you were looking for the REAL #1 80's Blockbuster from Peter Schilling you need to look elsewhere. This version doesn't sound all too bad, but it's definitely a different animal that sounds very different instrumentally and vocally. Buyer beware. Check the sample before buying.","a teen favorite for me, even before I knew about Bowie.","I listen to him growing up ,and loved all most all of his music .I married a man that enjoyed him to.","This download made me happy, felt like a teenager again. Awesome tune, sounds great.",Wanted to have the follow up to Space Oddity. Now I have it & have them both in my playlist together.,"This song just gets you thinking about death honestly. Great lyrics, great melody, and just everything about it is great.",Piece of crap....this IS NOT the original 80's version.  Go to you tube and listen for yourself.  Don't waste your money.,Did not have the intense quality of the music I remember .,"It's a good song, but I am not liking the singer on this one.

B001NZ0WP4,This is dr dre's worst album ever. It seems it was rushed and made in a day. All the songs are boring and the production sucks. I will try and forget that dre ever made this cd. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!,"A nice compilation by Dr Dre, not better than both Chronics or Compton. But it was a good start after he left death row. I like the whole cd, but east coast west coast killa was why I bought it. It brought back some memories.","Tight beats. Specially RBX  Dre's next album, Chronic 2001 - will finally put Aftermath on the map.",Thank you my husband really enjoyed this cd and listens to it often.thamk you so much really appreciate it. Cool,this could have been a classic if dre would have let his artists do that hardcore stuff even if he didn't wanna do gangster rap anymore himself dre should have stuck with his p funk roots and this would have been a instant classic I always liked the first chronic better.,"I'm glad I didn't bougth this new, I bougth it used, and gave it away a couple of days later. Simply because the album hardly got any good songs, the only ones worth mention is the intro, eastcoast/westcoast killaz, been there done that and the mel-man track called shi---n on the world. And for does songs I wouldn't pay this much. Skip it, unless you're a TRUE Dr. Dre fan that buys everything he touches. I recommend either ""The Chronic"" or ""2001"" if you want Dre at his best.","EVERYONE REALLY HATED THIS CD. I DON'T MIND IT. YEAH IT WAS HIS WORST, BUT IT IS STILL WORTH HAVING IF YOUR A TRUE DRE FAN. THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD SONGS LIKE:
AFTERMATH [intro] EASTCOAST/ WESTCOAST KILLAZ SH*TTIN' ON THE WORLD BLUNT TIME BEEN THERE DONE THAT FAME NATIONAWL AS THE WORLD KEEPS TURNING
IT'S NOT ALL BAD, LOOSIN' UP. GOOD JOB DRE.",i cant believe i was excited to buy this cd,"The seller did a great job nothing bad to say about that..  I was looking for the new Aftermath CD that was supposed to be released on 4/20 but couldn't find it in stores so I ordered what I thought was it on here

This CD sucks..  Dr. Dre doesnt even do much vocals and the beats and sound in general doesnt sound like what I expected from such a great artist

Adam","Dr. Dre's first release after leaving Death Row with this compilation of heavy hitters and newcoming artists.  With ""Aftermath (The Intro)"" strarting off this lp it seemed to be headed for a five star classic.  ""East Coast/West Coast Killas"" by Group Therapy consists of four emcees / rappers of killing lyrics of RBX, Krs-One, B-Real & Nas.  Mel-Man drops mediocre lyrics over the heavy bassline and hard kicks on ""Sh**tin' On The World"".  RBX bats again on the solo ""Blunt Time"" as he continues to deliver the hard lyrics as done on The Chronic.  Newcomer R&B diva, Kim Summerson delivers an impressive performance on ""Choices"".  Dre has a song of his own, ""Been There Done That"", as he compares himself to other rappers / emcees and producers.  The highlight of this release is production!","I bought this a long time ago thinking it was gonna be full of the usual heat Dr. Dre brings. I remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase I ever made for an album. There is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks, one after another. There are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value, I still enjoy them to this day. Of course it's because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like KRS-One, Nas, King Tee and an actual song with Dr. Dre on it.

KEEPERS:

East Coast/West Coast Killas
Been There, Done That
Str8 Gone

Throw the rest in the garbage and press delete.","this is a fairly good album by Dr. Dre's company Aftermath, and there are some excellent songs on here. an obvious standout would be East Coast/West Coast Killaz by Nas, KRS-One, B-Real & RBX. other good songs are Been There Done That by Dre, Sh*ttin On The World by Mel Man, and the less popular songs, King T's absolutely amazing Str-8 Gone & Sharief's song L.A.W, which may be the best song on the album. RC's cover of the song Fame is good and King T's verse is excellent. However, the rest of the album is simply cliche'd R&B and a disspointing song by RBX. Buy it, it's not that bad!","I like this album,rap, hip hop, r&b, god sounds all in this production of DR DRE. My favorite song EAST-WEST COAST KILLAZ featuring RBX, KRS ONE, CYPRESS HILL'S B-REAL and NAS is the bomb! And BEEN THERE DONE THAT is all  classic.","It's alright, the majority of the CD seems to be RnB though, I didn't really even bother with it. The good, rap songs though are ... On The World, Blunt Time, and Been There, Done That.","I would recommend this CD to fans of R&B and Smooth hip-hop. It's well produced and has variety. Nas, Krs-One, and B-Real are on it and I got this used through this website. Dre is the executive producer so it's really well-produced from top to bottom and I've played it a lotta times. It's definitely worth the cheap price I paid for it. It's kinda old school and I guess that's why peeps is hatin' on it. Every song is not about shootin' niggas. This CD is probably not for illiterate gang bangers or gangsta wannabees. These songs are by the new artists that Dre was trying to introduce from his new label after he left Death Row.","While fans of Dr. Dre will likely be happy to add this CD to their collection, they will find it one of his least impactful works. It does not rise to the level of previous music in terms of originality, quality, or even being able to listen to Dr. Dre himself.",Well produced album by Dr. Dre. Some of the bigger rap fans wouldn't see this as his best but it is well worthed the price.,there seems to be a lot of disappointment coming from most people.  many state that dr. dre had many other albums which were much better in quality.  some people state that there are too many other musicians in this album who are not worthy of it.,
B001PKTRVM,"the product is good as shown, however i have a problem with the contract extension. when i bought product from amazon, amazon indicated if i had an existing contract with at&t (which i had), i only had to extend by 6 months. at&t retracted on this position and stated i had to extend with a new contract for 2 years. i'm still trying to resolve.","I purchased this phone from AT&T in August. The music player didn't work correctly and frequently froze the phone with a ""Playback Error."" Only fix was to remove the battery and reboot. AT&T was very good about replacing the phone, but the 2nd and 3rd phones I received had the same problem. I discussed with LG and they were no help at all. AT&T was very good and replaced it with the LG Xenon. This is a far superior phone - the MP3 playback is awesome and it actually works. Don't waste your time or money with the CF360 - buy the LG Xenon instead. The cell phone quality is amazing and the slide out keypad is good for email and texting (if you are into that). I just wanted a good cell phone with a good MP3 player and the Xenon is outstanding in that regard.","I purchased the LG CU920 and loved it originally.  The keys became unresponsive and the phone impossible to use after a few months (I could accept calls, but do little else.)  ATT warranty services was very helpful and shipped me a replacement phone. All replacement phones are refurbs.  So, within four weeks my touchscreen was once again unresponsive. When I attempt to make a call and push the phone icon, it connects to mobile tv.  Needless to say, not very helpful.  It will temporarily work correctly for a few minutes after removing the battery and powering back on.  However, I don't feel compelled to remove my battery and restart my phone every minute.  So, I am waiting on my third phone in this model.

The phone is gem when the touchscreen is working.  I prefer it to the iphone thanks to the ability to send and receive picture and video messages directly.  The qwerty keyboard makes texting far easier.  However, given the fact that I have had 2 replacements in less than 9 months, I don't feel that these phones are very sturdy or reliable long-term.

Once again ATT warranty services was very helpful.  If you need them, call 1-800-801-1101.","This phone is for people who hardly tex,its great for taking pictures and making and taking calls.{The pictures come out great,and its very easy to use}Just be carefull using some of the features like games etc..They charge you for everything almost,and if your going to buy this phone,beware of the hidden cost,like 20bucks for texing,and roadside assistence and voicedial. I think these people get a commision by putting these charges on without you knowing it,so ask before they start ringing up your bill.","My wife and I chose these phones after looking at the CNET review, and because they were basically free with a new 2yr ATT contract. I purchased (2) 2gb Micro SD cards to extend the memory. When I put the card in my phone it would freeze up after a few minutes. I tried both cards with the same result. My wife's phone worked fine with it. So I called ATT and got a replacement. It worked fine for about 2 weeks. Now it's doing the same thing. My wife's phone is still working fine. So there are 2 things going on here. LG is making an inferior product and I'm losing the phone lottery! Maybe the 3rd phone will work...","First off, i don't understand these reviews, they must of used the phone to 3 hours then reviewed it. This is not a substitute for the iPhone. This is far from it, if you want an iPhone get one or get the Droid. This phone has little to no apps and they require subscriptions. You can't just swipe your finger up or down to scroll, you actually have to keep your finger on the scrollbar.

My brother has had this phone replaced 2 times. You can't customize the menu order or the homescreen icons. My brother doesn't want the data pack and doesn't want the TV, but when he tries to hit the menu button the TV app starts and at&t starts charging. at&t's solution, block data, but then you can't have pic messaging.","I USE TO HAVE A BLACKJACK PHONE, AND I WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, I LIKE THE LG VU EXPECT THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO TURN IT OFF EVERYDAY SO MY INTERNET SERVICE WILL WORK. ALSO, THIS PHONE IS NOT THAT GOOD FOR TEXT MESSAGING. I LIKE THE BLACK JACK WAY BETTER, BUT KNOW I HAVE A CONTRACT SO I AM STUCK.","This is a good phone and the only one on the market currently with dual sliding keyboards.  I owned a Nokia 6800, and once you own a phone with a QWERTY keyboard, you never go back. I purchased the Pantech Matrix Pro for the dual sliding keyboard feature and because it's a world phone with tri-band 3G and quad-band connectivity, usuable in many countries.  The down sides with this phone are 1) it's heavy because of the dual keyboard design, 2) screen rotation is slow compared to the lightning fast response of the Nokia 6800, 3) texting is slower compared to the Nokia 6800 (the Cadillac of keyboards) because of the small keyboard design and limited symbols, 4) very poor battery life; I have to recharge every other day with little texting and few calls.  It does take a bit to familiarize yourself with how to navigate smoothly in and out of screens, and there are many applications/features the user may or may not need, but all in all a good phone.","Let me start by saying I no longer have this phone. The phone itself is very cute, not bulky (as many have said), and  is a keeper. I liked the shininess of the phone (it came with a velvet case/cleaner) which I thought was a nice touch. I love Windows Mobile 6.1. This is a great operating system and worked well for what I needed. The only problem I had w the phone was the size of the display.and all the games on the phone are demos (not a favorite of this). Prior to using this phone I had the HTC Tilt (loved that phone!) and the display was much much bigger. When they decide to expand the display I will consider purchasing again. SO for anyone considering purchasing the Matrix Pro, know that its a great phone and worth the money!!!","That's what you get when you purchase T-Mobile Dash Black.  I love the phone but come on.  The phone comes with the same wallpaper and games.
*yawn* Nothing has really changed.

P.S.  Owner of both Dash phones.","The phone is great with a lot of features.  The Amazon people were great at answering my questions. Shipping was FAST and free and activation with AT&T was easy with what Amazon provided.  The price here is $50 less than getting it locally and Amazon had it in stock, not back ordered as everyone around here had.","Overall, my wife and I have both enjoyed our CF360 phones.  I agree with the prior review that the battery life is far too short, but we haven't had a need yet to have the phone be away from a charger for longer than a couple days.  I would expect that the phone could run without plugging it in for 4-5 days, with limited usage, but just with a small amount of talking (1 - 1.5 hours of talking), I've easily taken it down to 2 out of 3 bars.

The screen is bright, and this is the first slider phone we've owned, so we actually like that.  the number pad is a bit difficult to handle (Small and crowded), and this phone wouldn't be very well suited to someone who wants to text a lot.  The call quality is good, the phone gets a good signal if you hold it right (the antenna is in close to the mouth-piece), and the speakerphone works well.

Overall this is an OK phone for a free phone...","I received this phone 2 days ago from AT&T and am really impressed with it.  Great reception, great call quality and great battery life.  What more could you ask for?  It's small and light, but still easy to press the numbers on the slider.  Also, it has a nice non-slip feel to it. The phone connected right up to my Jawbone bluetooth headset with no problems. I'm very happy with this purchase.","I've had this phone for about a week so I haven't fully evaluated it yet.  I'm currently buying the micro usb cable and memory card so I can transfer ringtones.  Note: Don't let AT&T sucker you into getting their micro usb cable for this phone.  Any USB 2.0 Cable, A Male to Micro B Male Cable should work.  This phone replace a Motorola RAZR.","I've had this phone for over a year now, and I have had ZERO problems with it, which I think is pretty rare.  I've had many other phones, all which become pretty crappy after a while, even with good care.  This phone is easy to use, nice to look at, and very durable.  I've taken pretty good care of it, with a screen protector and a case for the outside, and I haven't had any problems with the screen being unresponsive or any of the hard keys, either.
I think if you take good care of the phone and don't seriously scratch up the screen, you'll avoid these problems.  Worked for me, anyway.  I love my phone and I'd definitely recommend it!  Especially at such a low price right now ($.01!!!) it's definitely worth it.  I paid about $100 for mine, plus activation, and I still think it was worth it.","The phone will work initially, but many who have purchased it are plagued by screen freezes and other issues. You will need to contact ATT if you have any of these issues.","the product arrives just as described. it has a dual-sliding keyboard and the price is quite affordable. the phone arrives with many interesting features, however, it isn't the most comfortable for texting.",I think this phone is best for people who do not text that much. Mostly for people who do a lot of calling and don't need a lot of memory. There seems to be a lot of problems for the phone if you want to use a bunch of different apps or text a lot.,
B002DRMPMY,"Cheap has a very negative connotation.  Here I'm trying to use it in a fair manner.  This adapter set is cheap in every sense of the word.  It costs next to nothing.  It's also made from some low grade plastics and the cable is pretty thin and very short.  However it works and I have had much success charging my phone in my car.  The down side is that the car adapter gets very hot over prolonged use.  I primarily use it on a Vector Y adapter which has pretty long extension cables.  I have to ensure that the car charger doesn't come into contact with anything flammable while in use.  I don't honestly think it gets hot enough to combust materials but it makes me a little uneasy if there's loose paper nearby.

I can't comment on the wall plug because I have not used it.

This is a 2 star product but it gets an extra star for a ridiculously low price point.  Beware the overly hot adapter but enjoy the savings.",Bought this charger for my best friend as a gift for his birthday and he told me that once he connected his palm pre to the charger the phone would go craze and the screen would turn on and off by itself. Don't buy go get a palm charger and save your phone from messing up.,"People say you get what you pay for, and with this combo's low price vs what you would normally pay I was a little worried.  I'm happy to say my worries were unfounded.  The items came quickly and they charge the phone just fine.  I found myself wishing the kit came with 2 cables so I had 2 individual chargers instead of running the cable from one to the other when I want to use it, but the cable is just a standard micro USB cable which can be found for a couple of dollars online if you look around.  It's worth the purchase just to have a car charger, but get yourself an extra micro USB and you suddenly have 2 new, completely independent chargers.  I highly recommend this combo for any Pre owners.","I recently purchased a USB Data Cable + USB Car Charger + USB Home Travel Charger for Sprint Palm Pre Smartphone.  I received my purchase in a timely manner.  My only problem with this purchase is that in order to get it to work, you have to wiggle the cord for it to start charging my phone but it will work.",This was an affordable package and works great as a back up to the charging accessories provided with the palm pre.,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/USB-Data-Cable-USB-Car-Charger-USB-Home-Travel-Charger-for-Sprint-Palm-Pre-Smartphone/dp/B002DRMPMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">USB Data Cable + USB Car Charger + USB Home Travel Charger for Sprint Palm Pre Smartphone</a>

works good enough for the price, and not being ""sprint"" brand.","I use this to charge my phone in the car on my commute back and forth to work because I listen to music from the Pre during the drive (MP3s or Pandora).  The car charger works, but it takes a moment for the phone to realize it is plugged in.  I thought it was an issue with the USB cord, but I have plugged it into the computer and the wall charger and both cause the phone to start charging immediately.  The flexibility of this combo is great! I now have an extra wall charger, a car charger, and an extra cord to charge and sync from the computer.  I would recommend this for any Palm Pre owner.","Bought it for my son.  He has not complained or commented on it, so it worked.","My phone would charge when I first used this charger, but have since stop when I plug it into my 12V adapter. The LED is on and my phone chimes as if it's getting ""juice"", but the battery doesn't charge up. I will be troubleshooting later.","The car charger and cable portion ot the order work great and are more than worth the coast. I was dissapointed withthe wall charger thoug, because even when the light is on, it will not charge the pre.","Both of the chargers worked OK for me, but the USB to Micro-USB cable I got is only 14"" long, which makes it pretty much useless for connecting anything to the chargers. The pictured cable is much longer. Also the picture of the AC charger shows a rating label of 1000 ma, but the one I got is labeled 800 ma, which is not a bit deal but don't trust the pictures.","In all fairness, I have only used the car charger part of this trio. I already have a home charger and usb mini cord, so they are tucked away as back-ups. The car charger has worked beautifully and I have yet to encounter any problems with it. It's not pretty, but it works. Super cheap so I was a little hesitant to purchase; glad I did though. Overall very happy with it.","i received the product and my wall adapter didn't charge my phone and i emailed the company and they emailed me back the same day saying that they would ship me a new one and they, and it works. So over all i was pleased with the product and customer service","THIS BUNDLE WAS NOT ONLY A DEAL FOR THE PRICE, BUT WORKS GREAT!! THANK YOU!!!",The cord I recieved was less than a foot long*** but the picture shows it as much longer. This is a big problem as I am unable to use the phone as it is plugged in at home or in the car without using speaker in which I do not prefer. I tried to email them 3 times providing the info requested with no response.,"the cord seemed a bit shorter than what was listed. although it does work it seems flimsy, and doesn't always work that well across a multitude of devices and/or configurations -- but it's decent enough just as a charger alone.","The adapter is very affordable. It is functional but it can become hot with use. It includes a car charger, cable, and wall charger. The cord is not as long as pictured.",for the price this charger works very well. the cord is a little short but for the price it will be helpful. it charges the phone just fine and therefore works the way it needs to.,
B002EOTJFM,put a photo in the back and it looks good have no complaints about this case. get a screen protecor for your phone 2,The case snapped tight and is quite clear. It seems to be made out of PC. It fell on the floor a few times and didn't break. Overall it's ok. but the design is a little wierd and doesn't look that attractive. Also made the iphone a bit bulky.,"The cover is good it self however, it doesn't look anything like what I saw when I bought it. This was really disappointing.","I'm a clumsy person and am prone to dropping my phone all the time...This protects both sides of your phone since it has a front and back snap on cover unlike others that only snap on from the back. I fell with phone-in-hand and landed screen to the ground, my screen is completely fine and the cover has a bunch of scratches that aren't very noticeable since it is clear. When dropped, the cover usually pops off but the phone is still fine (dropped multiple times). Only con is that it gets a little dirty on the back side with dirt, crumbs, whatever. Just pop off the cover and clean it, no big deal. And this thing is CHEAP.",This case is poorly constructed and has problems staying closed.  You get what you pay for.,it isn't what it showed on the picture and the front is way different. Also the front of the case want cleip together,Don't believe the reviews that state this case fits perfectly over a skinit. I had to use a piece of tape which makes the cheap case look cheaper.,"Well, I have to say Im disappointed because this little cover does not stay closed. It just pops right open again no matter how hard I try to shut it around my iPhone 3GS. Yes, its cheap, but I ended up spending about $5 on something I need to throw in the trash (I had to pay postage since I live in Hawaii). I bought it to go over a Gelaskin on my 3GS. Maybe if the skin was not on my phone (its only less than a 1mm thick) this thing would work. It seems quite fragile anyway. I liked the idea of a clear phone cover, but this one is not the one for me.",I bought this as a gift for my son who has some stickers from his football helmet on the back of his phone.  This was the perfect way for him to continue to display them and his phone to be protected at the same time.  Only bad thing is he has to take the case off to charge it on his iHome player.,"This case does not fit over my iphone.  I can get the back on it no problem, but I can't snap the front part of the case on!!  WASTE OF MONEY!!!","I bought this protector thinking that it would at least work. It doesn't even work, it doesn't hold on to the iphone at all, it keeps falling off all the time and dirt gets to the phone easily.","This cover didn't last me long i bought two, nd they both broke ... The actual case dosnt brake but the clips that holds it together are fragible, and after they break they are loose and dangling ..","It's very light plastic and very slippery. I'm not going to use it. I put it on and it nearly slipped out of my hand. It's just not protection, except from scratches, I'd think.
It's OK for the price!
I need something with a little grip, I think.",I'm notorious for dropping my phone so purchasing a durable clear cover was essential when I got my iPhone. The cover was easy to use and snap on but always snapped off when the phone was dropped. In fact it dropped one day and the plastic cover fell off and I couldn't find one of the two plastic pieces. For the most part it was great. Just don't drop your phone :),My orignal case broken in 1 day.  They rushed me out a replacement free of charge!  That is what I call customer service!  Thanks again!,"the case will look different from what is pictured, as there are two pieces that clip together.  the pieces break often, but will protect your phone from damage.",The case is quite made well especially for the price. Though sometimes it snaps off when your phone falls but it does the job of protecting the phone.,"the case is clear and can be modified to the owner's taste. it is made of plastic which protects a phone somewhat. however, this case will not fit all phones.",
B002JWJYX6,Looks just as picture fits perfectly.... arrived ontime also well all i can say is that it has a smooth texture and i would recommend..=),"broke within 2 days of use, very disappointed. was hoping for a better product. was only $5, not good item.",Fits phone perfectly. Snaps on and stays on and is also very hard to get off. I actually broke the front cover trying to get it off. But overall a great product. Fast shipping and packaged well.,"You get what you pay for. This item was inexpensive and seemed to look ok. However, it was very hard to get on and off. It broke the first time I tried to get it off.","I got this for my old blackberry phone. Server the purpose and felt nice. No complaints, me and phone where both happy.","fits very the phone very well, superb design and  looks great on the phone, very eye catching and classy..good job","It works just fine it is worth the money I spend on it, It arrived on time, Very cheap, I like it","The case is ok, however, the clasp on the bottom broke the first time i tried to put it on...","This case was great for the first few days. Then, once I removed it the first time the areas where it snapped in at slowly began falling apart. One by one they would no longer snap in and the case finally broken a few days later. You get what you pay for, and I would recommend avoiding these type of snap on cases.","This is a cute case at a good price; however, it doesn't fit quite right.  The back piece is cut so that it covers part of the top two buttons.  This would be okay if you didn't ever need those buttons, but since the button on the top left is the ""lock keyboard"" button--it's kind of a big deal.  Add to that it is a beast to get on and off, so if you ever have to do a battery pull (after downloading apps, for example) you will come close to breaking the case just to get to the battery.",This case is very strong and seems durable. The only reason it lost two stars is because I charge my batteries instead of my phone so I have to take off the case to get to the battery. It is very very difficult to prop open this case. Otherwise it has a very nice feel and seems like it can withstand a good amount of shock.,"close,i would not recommend any one to purchase this case,it arrived nicely packaged,but I did not enjoy this case,could of been more secure!",Great quality product. Sturdy and sleek looking.  Easy to snap together and take a part.  Shipped quickly. Great price for the product.,"I ordered this from eforcity via Amazon. When it arrived I thought it was odd that it was shipped in a plastic envelope without padding. I opened the package and noticed that the plastic was much thinner than I expected. When I went to put it on my phone, I discovered what I thought was a ridge in the plastic. As it turns out, the ""ridge"" was really a spot where the plastic was broken. Upon a closer inspection, I found two more broken spots. I've asked to return the item, but realize that buying a padded envelope will cost nearly as much as I originally paid for the case, including shipping.",product works well. never falls off or comes apart. love it! will def buy another one if needed,"If you frequently remove the case then it is going to leave some impact on it. Overall the product is nice and sleek, at the same time you are going to get what you are paying for. So keep an eye on that aspect also.",cheap and inexpensive phone case which ships quickly. it can be hard to put on or take off it's also very sturdy as well.,"Inexpensive phone case that arrives on time, but has some quality defects as sometimes the case can be difficult to install or remove, and sometimes the case breaks within the first few days of use.",
B002QIQ76K,This is a great case.  It doesn't negatively impact the phones functionality and I think it will adequately protect my phone.  I had a little trouble installing the screen's protective shield.  I should have read the directions.  I did eventually get the protective shield on properly.,"I opened the box took out cover, and immediately tried to put it on my phone. The back snapped on great and is solidly attached. I inspected the front before ever putting it on and it didn't look that promising. I carefully tried to attach it to the front of the Pre and one of the tabs snapped off. I was able to get it to stay in place -1 tab but it only lasted a few days before the others broke off.

Now I'm using the back with a rubber stick on front cover from another case set. I like the look very much but the front is not very usable.","I took a chance on this case since it was cheap and included a pouch and screen protector. I received the items 3 (which included the weekend) days after ordering and all items were shipped as promised. I ordered the blue case, which is darker than the one they show in the picture, but still a beautiful color. The screen protector was a little difficult to make sure it fit properly over the phone, but I was successful. The case fits quite snug and I am able to open the cover for the USB cord/charger without sliding open the phone. The case adds a decent grip to the phone without any bulkiness. If you are looking for a cheap case that works fairly well, this is a good buy! (And you get extra items too!)","I really like the case that came with this order. The little satchel is also nifty. However, the big issue is that the screen protector does not fit when the case is on. When the case is attached, the screen protector bubbles on all sides. Also, there's no whole for the microphone! What's up with that?!","After reading the reviews of this cover, I was kind of hesitant to purchase it, but the price was so good, I figured, 'why not?'  I'm glad I did!  I got the green fusion cover and it fits my Pre perfectly!  I love the color and the cover makes my phone feel a lot sturdier than it did.  I no longer feel like I'm going to break the keyboard when typing on it.  The top cover snapped right on, but I had a slightly harder time snapping on the bottom cover.  After the 2nd try, it went easily into place.  The phone slides the same as it did before, and it doesn't feel bulkier, just more secure.  I'm not afraid to hold it anymore!  AND it still fits in the small side pocket of my purse!  I think I'm going to get another cover for my hubby's Pre!

The only problem I had with this order was the screen protector it came with... I couldn't get it on without bubbles, so I just threw it away.  Didn't really bother me because the case was the big draw, not the screen protector.","As advertised.  I had hoped for a case that would give me a little more traction and protection while not turning it into a clunky eraser for a white board.  I am impressed.  The case fit together easily and the functionality is not hindered.  It actually provides a bit of sturdiness that helps out a bit on the opening and closing.  I can see how the charger might be a slight problem.  This is not the case for me as the little cover for the usb connector broke off the day I got it.  Now the case protects this area nicely.  If you are looking for something to absolutely protect your screen from breaking this is probably not it as it provides some extra padding but that is outside the scope of what they are doing here.  Overall, great product and great service.  Highly recommended.","DO NOT BUY THIS CASE! I got it 2 days ago and it already broke! It is really cheap plastic that breaks if you remove the case, I only took off the case twice and now when i try to put it back, it doesn't snap into place anymore!","I've had my case for a few days now and am very happy with it.  It looks good and the rubber has a nice feel to it.  It was extremely easy to install.  It does not interfere with any functionality, except, as another reviewer pointed out, it does prohibit closing the phone when the USB charger is attached.","This case is All good!  I fits perfectly.  I would give it a Five but the Screen protector does not cover the entire face.  There is a nice gap at the bottom for Voice speaker(whatever you cal it)so callers can hear your voice.  It should have been long enough with a hole in it. But this is still a great case and screen protector.  It is a must buy, I don't think it gets any better than this and plus you get a few color options.  The phone fits perfectly into your pocket. It still has its slim sleeky design. I recommend this for Pal Pre users.","Contend states ""5 Color Options"" but only 3 are shown. It this product available in black ?",This palm pre case does not fit very well and is very hard to get on and off.  since I use the magnetized charger i have to take the back off to charge it and this is a huge hassle.  It also prevents my phone from locking sometimes.  I would not buy this product again - cheap knockoff.,So yeah when I first got the cover I was excited because i lost that original bag it came with.  But then i tried to put on the screen cover and that had a bend in it so it wouldn't properly stick without airbubbles.  Then I lost the little pouch it came in somewhere.  Then when i snapped on the case the back went on fine  but the front however would not clip.  Everytime i opened the phone it would come off. It became really frustrating that I don't even use the front cover.  And on a side note just having the back cover it really is plastic and flimsy.  It shakes a lot.  pretty much this deal is cheap and the product is cheap.  I am going to buy the Seido case today instead.,"The case has a good feel to it and unlike some of the other Pre cases it does not interfere with the use of the unit. The case came with a few screen protectors which is nice, as with all screen protectors they eventually need replaced. I'm pretty happy with it. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the charger/usb door is a little tough to open with the case on, unless you have long nails.","There was no problem whatsoever with customer service or delivery, but I have purchased three of these covers (we have 2 Palm Pres), and all three of them have broken.","I really like the color and finish of this case (blue).

One big problem though- this case IS NOT COMPATIBLE with the Touchstone charger!

I would have appreciated knowing that upfront.  Otherwise, the case does not impair functionality.  I cut a large hole with a dremel tool and it works great now with the Touchstone (in fact, no more guessing exactly where to position the phone on the charger).  Case is solid and will protect the phone when it inevitably bites the pavement.",This is a great case. 5 color option but only 3 shown. It is not compatible with the touchtone charger,The colors of the covers are all pretty and the cover fits and protects well but the screen protectors are often of low quality and don't cover the screen well,"this phone case is very affordable and sturdy with the exception of the screen protector, which is difficult to attach and not user friendly.",

Good luck on that.  It can be done but it should not be so difficult. It might be a design flaw of the phone or it could be a design flaw of this adapter. Either way, it should not become disconnected from the phone so easily.  Boo, hiss to Samsung for not having included a normal headphone port.

B002WC7RKA,"I've had my Droid for 8 months.  The first cover was hard plastic and cracked when I dropped it.  The phone store sold me this case in April 2010, telling me it was the best protector for my phone.  On that I would agree - I've dropped it several times and the screen hasn't even changed.  However, my case is now hanging off my phone in pieces.  Long, thin strips come off regularly.  There's not much left of the top or bottom.  It started peeling about two months ago, so I'd say this cover lasted intact for about four months.  I'm currently shopping for a new case and will not purchase another Body Glove.",when I recieved this product it was not new it was used top part of body glove did not fit properly. It was missing the attachment for the belt loop. package was opened not sealed.,"My husband got this for his phone and loves it! Its hard to get off and on, but he loves to be able to clip it on his pants","This is the only case that makes sense for this device.  I only rated it a 4, because the front casing can become detached or crack with some wear.  This is because the on/off switch is close to the top of it.  I don't think they could have done much more.  Protects the phone. I've dropped mine on concrete more than once, and the case saved me!","This was a nice cover...while it lasted. The clips that hold the covers on the droid eventually become worn. The face cover was the first to go...started falling off after about two months. Three months after purchase, the large back cover started falling off, as the holding clips simply break off or become worn. I won't buy another one, as it is too costly and has to be taken off if you plan to use the dock.","I thought the case was great. The only thing was the thin top piece came loose and fell off while the case was attached to my belt. I was unable to find this piece but I am still using the  bottom piece with the clip.
Thank you
Rich Gibian",I purchased this case with my phone in the July.  Yesterday I went to slide my phone open and the bottom of the cover fell off.  The clasps broke on one side.  I also noticed when I tried to get it back on that it made the plastic on my Droid pop up out of place. It seems very ill fitted to this phone.  I do not recommend it.,Very pleased with this case. I love the clip and the rubberized case. I can sit it on my dash in the car to view the gps without it sliding around. GREAT BUY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A DROID CASE!!!!!!!!!,"I have owned the droid and this case for about 5 months now.  It has saved my phone several times.  I use the belt clip which works well (make sure the tab is seated properly in the case before putting it over the droid).  My children are constantly climbing on my back, and kicking it, knocking it off, etc., but through several months of this, the phone itself doesn't have a scratch on it (I also use the clear screen protectors, a must).  The case is a different story - it looks like it's been through a war.  In fact, it finally broke the other day (the little tabs that go over the front part of the phone finally snapped off), and that is why I am here ordering a new one (actually, I think I'll get two...)

The drawbacks are that getting the case off and on is a chore, and as others have noted, the battery occasionally needs to be removed for a ""cold reboot"".  The other drawback is the design of the little tabs could have been a bit better (though I admit I am very hard on it).

Overall, a good product, and one I would recommend.",Do NOT order this item! It does not fit the droid properly as in the front piece comes off regularly and there is no way to securely attach it. It wasn't worth the S & H to return it.,"I have had several Body Glove brand phone cases in the past. All of my LG phone brand cases were great. The Droid case is cheaply made at the same Body Glove price. I have had 2 of the Droid cases and both have broken at the tabs that hold the front cover on. My friend has had the same issue. The case is very difficult to remove from the back but that isn't really a big deal. I was really hoping for more from this product, that is why I paid the premium price. It is on sale now but I would go to the many Droid forums and look into the experiences of other to find a case that will work.",Don't buy this case.  Leather cover is coming off of the plastic.  Started falling apart after 2 months.  I expected more.,Easy to install and does a great job of protecting the Droid body.  I bought a separate screen protector because one is not included with this product. I recommend to keep your Droid looking new.,"This is my 3rd bodyglove (for 3 different phones).  It is hard with a little give, making it very good protection for the phone, but also light.  I love this case!","The case came in a timely manner. It fit snugly into my new DROID. It does a great job of protecting my phone. Also able to use it to stand up on desktop. Only thing there is no cover for the screen, however, I do not feel it's necessary. Highly recommended as it gets the job done.","Most users note they enjoy the case and it provides good protection. Some users note the case started falling apart after 2 months, but overall the quality and fit is good.","the general consensus about the product is mixed; while it is generally apprecciated for its protection quality, there were several complaints about its duration, as many reviewers reported a rapid wear and tear of the leather cover.",it protects phones quite well when dropped. the case itself has a few weaknesses such as the front casing showing wear and cracking. the clips are a bit weak as well and can break. case fits the phone well.,
B0036FTZZW,"""Have you ever wondered how a lawyer feels after he helps a client he knows is guilty, beat the legal system?""

I loved this book. I read it in 2 days and couldn't put it down. Great plot twists that I didn't see coming. Some puncution and grammer errors, but they didn't get in the way of the story. It does answer the question about why some attornyes will work for clients that they know are guilty. Great Read!","I like this book because the topic interesting.  The questions posed by author are ones that I have had myself.  While I this isn't a true crime story it does give you something to think about.  Travis is very good at his job of getting people an acquittal.  Some people felt the vigilante was ""cleaning up"" behind Travis.  How much effort would the police put into finding someone that was taking care of what the legal system didn't? It is definitely worth reading.","I really enjoyed this book, by an author I'd never read before.  Plot was interesting and new,  with a very unexpected ending...and the price was terrific for my Kindle!","This book could have been really enjoyable, however, there were so many words spelled wrong, words left out, wrong words used (loose instead of lose about 100 times) that I had a difficult time reading this book.  If Mr. Shea decides to place another book on Kindle - please, please, PLEASE have someone proofread it before putting it out there for the world to read.  Subject matter and novel concept would have gotten 5 stars, but the rest caused it to be only one star.","A good premise spoiled by mixed-up facts and a sophomoric writing style - and then there was the ending. I can't remember ever being so disgusted with a protagonist and the way the author treated him. What was the author saying? ""Oops?""",I read many thrillers and this one falls short after getting off to a good start. The endingWAS NOT GOOD.,"This is the first time I have written a review.  I really really liked this book.  The characters were real and the plots and twists made it an enjoyable read to the end.  By the way, the end was not what I expected.","The plot of this book was great but the presentation of the book was awful.  The dialogue between the two main lawyers was very high schoolish...I noticed more than once the word WHERE was used in place of WERE...The first time I thought it to be an error, but once I saw it more times I knew it was just someone who hasn't a clue...I got tired of seeing the ""..."" in a lot of the dialogue...The ""..."" usually fell at the end of a line so one of the ""dots"" started on a new line with a lower case word and it just threw the whole sentence off.  If you can get through the high school dialogue, the childish behavior of his wife, the bad punctuation, and missuse of words, then you'll have a decent book to read.","I just finished reading ""Defending Evil"", and found the premise and story held my interest. It was, however, marred by the many grammatical errors, improper use of punctuation, improper word usage (loose instead of lose, many times). I kept thinking of Vince Flynn in an interview I watched him do one time - he told of how he couldn't spell worth a darn, so had an editor who went over what he wrote and put in the proper spelling and punctuation so his books would be readable. It seems Mr. Shea has a talent for writing, perhaps recruiting a person to proofread and correct is in order.","This author seems to have an imagination capable of good plot development, but his execution falls short for me.  At about the 3/4 mark, poor spelling and usage, bad sentence structure, odd punctuation and incomplete editing are combining to make this a tough read.  In addition, the writing level and depth seems to be descending from the mature toward the juvenile.  I'm having trouble forcing myself to finish.","Ever wonder why attorneys represent guilty clients . . . I hate it when a review gives away the story so I'll be careful because this was a really enjoyable read with a great ending and I would have been sad if someone had ""ruined it"" for me.  The story was well written and hard for me to put down (I kept sneeking reads at the office) and finished it in a day (OK, I read it a lot at the office because I HAD to find out what happened next).  There were some great twists to the story that kept catching me by surprise and kept me turning pages (or rather clicking pages).  The charaters were wonderfuly developed even if I didn't like all of them (its hard to like a murderer). Oh, and yes, it did answer the question of why some attorneys defend clients they know are guilty of terrible crimes.  Enjoy!","The story line is probably alright, but I have trouble getting past all the grammatical errors - words left out and/or misspelled - LOTS of them. And this author apparently LOVES exclamation points! There are so many!! It makes it look like the book was written by someone very immature!!!  Oh sorry, got carried away...","I just finished reading the book. It was a really good story, that kept me interested all the way through! If you like suspense, this book is definately for you. There were some grammar and punctuation errors, but they in no way took away from the story. I would definately recommend this book! Great job Mr. Shea!","I read in the other reviews about the proofreading errors.  I must confess that while it has been very noticeable in some of the other books I've read, I was so engrossed in the story I didn't really notice them here.  This book had me from the beginning, and while I thought I knew where it was going, I was surprised at the end.  If you like legal thrillers, this book is for you!","I too like so many others in the Kindle world (I have noticed) download random, inexpensive or free books, sometimes taking our chances with what we are getting.
I personally had never read anything by Charles Shea, but I thought the book was great! I found it hard to put my Kindle down and on my breaks, reading from my iPhone at work!
I have since added him to my ""of oh yeah, I will read this guys again"" list!",The plot of the book was excellent and very exciting except for a few grammatical errors. The characters are real and the twists made it interesting to read to the end.,"an intriguing and exciting book for those interested in why lawyers take on legal cases, knowing their clients are guilty. the story includes unforeseen twists/turns, keeping the reader engaged - if you can see past the execution errors. unfortunately, this book falls short, riddled with grammar and proofreading mistakes.","a book with an interesting theme and story, with some grammatical errors in the book, and with an interesting ending.",

B003SU4ZRS,This is not a good product.  I have tons of fingerprints trapped under the screen protector (this is the 3rd product I've bought and have yet to find a good one).  More problematic is the fact that the top screen protector is not cut properly.  The holes are measured correctly.  I can't recommend buying this.,"This is an awesome set of protectors.  Comes with covers for front, back, and the sides.  If you have the slightest idea what you are doing it is very easy to install and works great.","Purchased this for my black iPhone 4s. Applied it as-per instructions.. but i must have had a fairly dust environment when I applied it because there was a fair amount of it beneath the film. To fix it I removed the film, washed it with warm water and hand soap then applied the film while still wet. It worked great! Little to no dust under the film. Also, I had to remove te back and side film because it interfered with the case I purchased. Over all the Wrapsol film is fantastic and looks/feels great. Highly recommended!",do not waste your money like i did please worst film ever designed squeegie messes up the film and tons and tons of bubbles do not i repeate do not buy,"there are three big reason for money wasting.
1 finger prints problem
2. bubbles  problem
3. need very pro skill to apply.
I think after buy that product 95% people will be unsatisfied .
conclusion- Please buy original wrapsol kit.","one: this wrapsol is for a CDMA model, not a GSM (AT&T for example).
two: even with the stupid wrapsol on it, my phone got a scratch on a side and it was a less than a meter fall...
three: it seems to protect my phone, but actually its a polluting piece of junk. Since that time that it fell down, I only use it with a bumper case.

Note: It does protect against keys and that type of sharp items that can fit in my pocket with my phone, but honestly i own a phone that cost me over $500 dollars, so i really take care of it.","Don't buy from this listing, the reason it's so cheap is that you're going to get recalled defective product. If you buy directly from Wrapsol you know you are getting the newest release of their products. They had a quality issue with the first batch of the iPhone 4 films that they made that has since been fixed, and that's what you're going to end up getting if you buy it for cheap. Until you see ""Ships from and sold by Wrapsol"" I wouldn't bother.",this protector is great. it doesnt have a sticky feel and the front and back feel like there is nothing on. installation was fairly easy.,"The films i received were not properly cut. The holes on the front did not line up perfectly with the home button and the front camera and speaker. The back film is a bit short and doesn't cover the entire surface. These things don't bother me as everything still works but if you're picky, buy from Wrapsol!","The screen protector itself is nice quality but the holes don't line up nice with the speaker and the home button. The back protector works great, the big problem I had was how the side protectors fit... Or lack there of. They are supposed to keep the silver edge of the iPhone nice, problem is you have to cut it to make it work and it still doesn't fit right. So buy it for the main screen protector and the back one. Other then the sides not fitting it went on pretty easy and the one bubble I had in it was gone in 24hrs","So I have to admit that the first Wrapsol I got for the iPhone 4 was horrendous, but when buying directly from Wrapsol then shipped me a new one and told me to make sure I use the squegee included to allow stretching. The 2nd time around I love it and it was pretty easy to put on. Im not quite sure about the respositioning part of it all, but I got a perfect fit this time around and didn't have to spray water with the ones you do with Zagg.","Pros:
-thin, shiny, clear, and sleek to touch (as opposed to Zagg/Invisible Shield which is thicker, less shiny, and feels rubbery)
-resists fingerprints
-bubbles resolve quickly and easily

Cons:
-dry application is difficult to apply. (contrary to popular belief, a wet application is much easier and will be lint-free and easy to reposition, as in the case of Zagg/Invisible Shield).
-not 100% fit. will be a few millimeters short in each direction but won't matter if you put it in a case like I do
-falls off more easily than Zagg.
-the ""repositional"" claim is misleading. yes, you can peel it on and off, but when you do, the glue gets broken and distorted as you lift it and restick it.
-retains scratches and etches/melts! I got some Purell hand sanitizer on the phone and tried to wipe it off and it basically etched the Wrapsol (not a stain, physically deformed the plastic). SEE PICTURE that I uploaded and note the big swirly scratches on it is caused by me trying to wipe off the Purell. I would watch out in case other chemicals (sunscreen, alcohol, etc) melt the Wrapsol.",It's the best so far and really reduces fingerprints ! Highly recommend and will buy fir my iPad too !,"the same result as I bought the evo protector, the size is not right
and this item is for att, hope seller can mention that.
side protector are useless for verizon iphone","note - i did not purchase from amazon, because at the time it was not offered.
but this product is great.
It is a little difficult to install correctly.  It takes time, patience and a dust/hair free area.  Also, it took double the length of time they said it would to get all the bubbles out.

Now the first one that was sent to me arrived folded over, which created a crease.  I contacted them, emailed a pic and was sent a entire new set very quick.

No one ever believes that I have a skin on my phone.  It doesn't stick to the fabric of my pant pockets, etc.  Do not put it in a plastic bag in especially in the heat.  (I did this at the beach and had to re-install the product which luckily worked.)",the phone case is thin and mostly useful as a decoration rather than protection for the phone. it doesn't add excess weight to the phone.,the screen protector is relatively of good quality. it reduces risk of damage of your phone and fingerprints are reduced. comes with covers from the side and back. its worth your money and will serve you right.,"the screen protector is well made and it reduces fingerprints. however, the size isn't always the right one and the holes don't fit perfectly.",
B003UO175U,"I received these in the correct amount of time and I did receive 3 as stated, unfortunately they are not anti glare as they have a high mirror finish which makes the iPhone very hard to read in any light. I assume they sent me the wrong ones and will see if they do anything to correct this problem.","These are inexpensive and have the anti-glare finish, but I can never get them applied without bubbles.  Maybe it's my own fault.  I'm going to have someone at the store do one and see if they can do better.","I have used several similar products for my phones and cameras and this one is on the low side of average. The paper labels were difficult remove without creasing/stretching the film - they were too sticky and the backing came off.

The film itself is very easy to fit and I managed it without any bubbles etc but I was surprised how quickly and easily it became scratched just through normal use - and I'm not a particularly heavy phone user.

Another gripe was with the supplier. I ordered a pack of three but only one was sent - this was rectified later but not without several emails etc.",The ad said three protectors only got one. Sent emails to complain never got response. Great way to do business.,"These are a must to protect the I phone screens.  They are inexpensive and shipped out fast.  They do not hinder any actions with the phone, and I suggest everyone purchase screen protectors.","The product came as described and promptly!  It does take a bit of skill and patience to apply the screen protector without bubbles and in the right position, but that is up to the consumer to do the research to be able to apply it correctly.  It worked great on my iPhone4.. perfect.","Totally worth the price, I haven't found one screen protector that doesn't leave any bubbles, I applied the first one to my phone and it left a tiny bubble.  I can live with that, rather have the protection than my screen get all scratched up.  So I would say its worth buying.","These things are junk & a waste of money.  They will not go on without tons of bubbles, and the tab that is on screen saver to help remove it from the backing won't come off without leaving it's glue mess behind (impossible
To get off your new screensaver!!!) a total rip. I threw all away.","The screen protectors shield your phone from scatches, I constantly toss my phone in my bag along with my keys & even though my screen protector is scratched up my screen isn't .

I was a little nervous about the application process after reading some of the reviews, but I had no problem.  The screen looks perfect.","Super inexpensive, fast shipping, great quality! This item is about $15-$20 in the stores and to have this option is amazing! If applied correctly, goes on easy, smooth, and bubble free.","It took longer than the expected delivery date and when it finally arrived, it was not for the iphone 4 as stated. Also, nowhere in the ad does it mention that it is mirrored. Definitely disappointed with it and not what I expected at all.","I went to best buy to find a screen protector for my iPhone and all the ones there were priced @ around $20 and up, plus they only had the glossy finish, but I found these online and have them a try, and I love them, plus they come with 3 of them. It's a great buy & the quality is good.","These screen protectors are cheap and it shows. I couldn't find a screen protector at the local Apple Store (which cost around $15), so I decided to give these a try thinking I would only loose five bucks (in my mind I forgot to take into account the shipping cost). Well, I had to get the protective screen at the Apple Store anyway.

The problem with these screens is that they already had some dust particles. I wasn't sure if I had messed up with the first included screen, so I took a closer look at the second one (I only got two, instead as three as the other reviewer got) and I can confirm that it had some dust. My iphone's surface was very clean since it had been inside its original box until then. With dust you get bubbles, so both of these screens ended in the trash can.

Now that the price of these screens has gone even cheaper some people may still decide to buy them, but even if it's not a lot of money you will still lose around $8 and end up buying the more expensive ones. My advise; learn from my mistake and avoid these.",The item will not allow the touch portion of the iPhone to work. I think the plastic may be to thick. I ended up throwing it away.,"iPhone touch portion is somewhat protected but not against bubbles, and people spend a lot of money to buy this phone. The protector is also send along with.  Shipping is  fast.  Slightly want to improve the package of this type of costly iPhone.",great price. only works for certain iphones. sometimes it is hard to apply the screen protector to the phone properly. the ad says it comes with 3 but sometimes only 1 is received.,the product can be tricky to apply neatly to a phone screen. there are problems with the company sending the correct product. the protective film is low cost and doesn't last long under normal use but comes in a three pack.,
B003VDC4PW,"Got these from the seller very quickly. They work fine. A bit prone to scratches, but you get five of them in the package. Very easy to install.","Well, I guess you get what you pay for.  The protectors do not stick well to the phone, even after a good cleaning.  Careful application and strong squeegee of face and it still ends up with some air bubbles.  These fit the ENTIRE face of the phone so if you have a case, you will have problems.  I had to cut it down so that the case didn't interfere with the protector.  The next time I need protectors, I'll just spend the extra money and get them from verizon.  I've never had issues with those.","Very nice quality, packaging has separate front and rear protective sheets, crystal clear when applied.  A couple of tips for installing.  Align the top and bottom cutouts on the face of the phone and then press down in the middle of the protector and work your way out to the sides to minimize the number of air bubbles.  Turn the phone off to see where the remaining bubbles are and use a credit card to work the bubbles out.","The protector fits perfectly over the screen, not the whole face of the phone. It has been on for three weeks now without peeling back or anything. But it is not exactly ""crystal"" clear. You can kind of tell that there is some kind of film on it but it is to reduce the glare. I prefer glare reduction over the film which anyone can get use to anyways. Overall I'm happy with this product.","Cheap price definitely equals cheap protection.  I originally had the screen protector that came with my OtterBox case (by the way, highly recommend investing in that case for the Incredible if you plan to keep your phone for a long time) but a friend put their cigarette next to it by accident and the protector melted (yet still protected the screen).  As I will be looking to trade in my phone in the coming months, I didn't want to spend too much on a new screen protector.  After a week, it looks like it lost a fight with a cat and there are scratches every where.  Of course, it could have been a mime with long fingernails since there are prints all over it too as if the said mime was trying to escape from that invisible box but was really just pushing up against my phone.  All in all, it's a cheap product that gives you cheap protection.  Look elsewhere and watch out for mimes.",I ordered these screen protectors mostly because they got relatively good reviews and the price was right. I received the product only to find that the protector only covered the lit area of the screen...it doesnt cover the entire face of the phone. I didn't even bother putting it on since it didn't offer complete coverage.,"This protective screen was advertised as a full screen protector with a small hole for the speaker.  On the first delivery I received a generic screen protector.  Customer service was quick and told me they would send out a new order shortly.  They did send the new order, but it was more of the same, a generic screen protector, not full screen.  Contacting them again, they told me they would just end up sending me the same thing so they just credited my account.

Screen Protector - False advertising
Customer Service - Very good",Screens are  good quality . But  the holes don't line up exactly with the phone  but not to bad . I would recommend them.,"I had gone through three screen protectors in less than five months and I needed to replace them because of bubbles and them not sticking properly.  I bought these because they were a good deal and required no cutting.  I had NO idea there was a difference in screen protectors!  Although they go on the same way, these left no bubbles at all.  Plus, somehow it must be thinner or something, because my phone is now more responsive to my touch.  With the old screen protectors, I had to remove a glove to make things happen.  Now I don't have to.  Who knew?  It seems these smudge easier, because I find the need to wipe it off more frequently.  But since I've almost always got a sleeve or pants leg handy, that's not a significant problem (although I deduct one star because they are not PERFECT perfect).  With five of these, I probably won't have to buy more before I upgrade to a different phone, but I would happily buy these again.  FYI:  I purchased these from Benson Xin Guang Huang and received a quality product and fast 1st class mail shipping.","Had this phone for a few months now. Alright phone overall, a little bit slow with the processing, but can't complain too much. Gets the job done.

But the other night, as I was texting a girl I know to come over for a little Cinco De Mayo Fiesta, my phone decides to lose cell connection for an hour. After an hour of wondering why she never showed, my phone blows up with 6 different texts:

1. ""Hey outside, let us in?""
2. ""Fredddddddd...""
3. ""Come on Fred I can literally see the party through your window""
4. ""This isn't funny""
5. ""FU we're leaving""

Screw you phone.","I think the review title says it all. These screen protectors are easy to put on and there are no bubbles. It protects the screen from scratches but my sticky fingermarks are still very visible so if you're after something that prevents fingermarks then this is not for you. They also send you 5 of these for like, $2 so you can't really beat that.",These came really fast and are exactly what I wanted.  Thank you for being so fast.  It would be a little nicer if they had a tool to help keep the bubbles out when applying but otherwise a very good product.,"Does not cover the entire face of the phone, which leaves the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen unprotected.
Technical details for these protectors says ""Cover the full screen!"".  Well, it does NOT!!!","I recieved these 5 Screen protectors expecting from the product picture to have a full screen protector, ie. around the trackball and all.  When I recieved them, they are the size of the screen ONLY!!  Repeat, they are only for the actual LCD size of the phone and even that it's too narrow to get to the edges.

5 for such a cheap price, you get what you pay for, no coverage for the rest of the screen.

Going to go back to a Zagg, never had any problems with them.  I'll use these TOO SMALL screen protectors on some other electronics if I need too.",Very good product and easy to apply. 5 pack for this price you cant beat it. Dont waste your money on those expensive protectors!,"These protectors are normally very quick to arrive, and are much thinner than other screen protectors on the market. This is a pack of five for quite a low price, and are only large enough to cover the LCD screen of your phone, not the entire phone face. Like most screen protectors, you have to really work the air bubbles out after installation because no tool comes with the product to help you squeegee the bubbles out.","the product is well made, arrives well-packaged and the screen is pleasant to the eye. however, it processes features a bit slowly.","These screen protectors are a good value for a pack of five. Easy to install with no bubbling. However, this is ONLY for the screen and NOT the whole phone.",
B003ZHPWKS,This look a metal case and they price like a metal case but when i received this case i was very disappointed in is a cheap case that you can get at the 99 cent store. Don't be fool by this case it look great online but is a cheap plastic that you can fold with your hand and it won't protect your phone,"I purchased this case on 5/25/11 and by 6/20 the plastic piece just above the volume control broke off.  Within the next month, a crack appeared on the backside and the corner guard above the volume fell off today.

I'd rate myself as an average cell phone user in terms of gentleness.  I don't pamper my phone, but I also don't drop it that often; in fact, I believe I've only dropped it once.

The reason we get cases for our iPhones is to protect them.  Surprisingly, this case has scratched the aluminum core running around the outside of the phone, which I find odd.  Do yourself a favor an find another case.  This one looks cool, but will be in pieces shortly after you begin using it.","Great fitting and feeling case. Slim, and comfotable in the hand.

But it's already cracked in two or three places.

Still works ok, but dissatisfied about the plastic quality, or lack thereof.

J","I bought this case thinking it fully covered the outside of my iPhone but it didn't.  The pictures online made it difficult to determine the full shape.  Unfortunately, after only just a few days, I dropped my phone and the side of the case cracked.  Wasn't worth the money.",Product arrived quickly and looked just like the pictures. Looks great on my iphone 4 and I've gotten so many compliments on it. I love it!,"I bought this right before the holidays, and while the case looks really cool, their plastic is not strong enough over the volume control, and this has broken twice.  I have a second iPhone case that i switch between, but i doubt that this case will last more than 6 months.  The price is great, but i wouldn't recommend it to others unless you are buying it only for a short-time...","I read the reviews before I ordered this case. So many people wrote that it broke or chipped way too soon. I thought, I am a careful woman, surely it won't happen to me! Wrong! It did. The FIRST day I had the case. Maybe my hand wasn't used to the case, but I dropped it. The phone was protected, which I guess is the point, but the right lower corner of the case broke off. It is now totally worthless. I learned from this to, not only read the reviews, but to take the advice too!
And, does it matter that it was cute for the few hours I used it? No, not at all.",I had the black version of this case prior to this one which broke unfortunately when my phone was dropped.  The silver is much more cheap looking and has a cheap feeling to it.  The photos look much better online than in person.,"This cover is so cheaply made and really adds very little protection to the phone. If you are just trying to not scratch the sides and the back, this is the cover for you. As long adn you don't bump it too hard or drop it from a minimal distance, you're good. The thin area between the volume and vibrate buttons and the front face cracked through after about a week of taking it in and out of my pocket and a small pump into our coffee table. Lol. This cover looks cool, but you should also purchase the clear film protective shields for the back of your phone also, as dust accumulates in the holes of this cover and it may cause scratches to the phone. And we all know that cell phones hold their value, and the better you take care of it the more you'll get out of it later. all in all i would never purchase this cover again, or the other elago ultra thin covers. i have had the same experience with those as well.",This is probably the fourth case I've tried through amazon and the first one that I haven't returned. It's nice because it's not bulky and all the buttons are easily accessible however the picture doesn't show that both the top and the bottom of the phone aren't covered. I'm worried about what would happen if it got dropped. Keeping the case though because it makes the phone look really nice.,"This case looks pretty good, but it is poor constructed. Pieces around the edges have already cracked off and a hairline fracture has appeared on one corner of the case. This will no doubt result in a larger piece of the case falling off soon. All of this occurred within the first week I have had the case. It only cost $10 though, so I guess I got what I paid for.","This cover looks metal, but it's not!  I love this one!  It just looks really neat on the phone.",This iphone case is really bad it broke in just a week i got it and it is even harder,"Looks cool in the pictures, looks totally different in hand.

Snaps on to my iPhone good enough and offers adequate protection of the back and corners. That's all I wanted because I'm careful with my phone, it's just a small insurance policy that I though would look cool and match the style of my MacBook Pro.

Wrong. This thing is cheap plastic that has poor finishing. Bits of plastic hang off the edges and I needed to ""tidy up"" the edges with nail-cutters. There is no ""shimmer"" to it like in the photos, so it doesn't even look CLOSE to aluminum. I knew it was plastic, but the photos make it look much better than what it really is.

I gave it 2 stars because it fits well and was posted quickly. The looks are a huge downside.",My case has broken after a week. I dropped it accidently from a about 2 feet high and it broke in two spots.,it's an affordable case so you get what you pay for. this case is for those looking for a cheaper alternative to the big brands.,"This case looked like metal in the pictures, and was priced like metal, but in reality it is cheap plastic that easily cracks and breaks. It seems to fit just fine on the phone but the picture was deceiving as to how much of the phone was covered.",looks different than the picture. breaks easily after not much use. doesn't offer much protection to the phone.,2 disagreements
B00403MNZ8,"added to my book collection for my kindle and I always have great reading material just at my fingertips from my phone, laptop or tablet","I read this with a lot of effort, It was all over the place. Did not get quality for my money.","This prequel was not what I expected.  It was far to short, told nothing about Betsy's pre-undead life, and was simply frustrating.  Even free would be too much for this book.
I would not recommend it to anyone!",The dumbest thing I have ever read and hopefully will never encounter again. Please do not write any more books,I don't know why I picked this book in the first place.  No hook to peak my interest as yet.,"Quirky short story intended to be a teaser for Me, Myself Why.  Works well as that.  I know find myself looking to read the longer novel to discover exactly what this quirky heroine is about.","I thoroughly enjoyed ME, MYSELF AND WHY?, so thought this short little prequel would be a fun, entertaining read.  Well, it's definitely short, and it was free, so I guess I can't complain.  I actually did chuckle a little - I mean, a guy at a speed dating event talking about his experience with a woman with multiple personalities should be funny, right?  But it was just way too short and rushed to really amount to anything.  Plus, even though it was super short and published by a big-name publisher, it still contained spelling and grammatical errors.  Overall, okay for a free, quick read, but don't feel you need to rush it to the top of your ""to-be-read"" pile.","I am SO thankful I now take the time to read reviews before I purchase. This was a freebie I got when I first got my kindle.

If I could taste less than 1 start I would. This prequel, which should NOT say it has 300+ pages, did not make me want to buy the actual book.

I didn't find it funny. The way it was written was quite confusing. You have no clue what going on at first and then it ends very abruptly.

Extremely unsatisfying. I do NOT recommend.","Very funny, I have got to read the series to find out what happens next. Definitely shows MaryJanice Davidson's quirky humor.","The starts out with a flashback of Clive telling his story about what happened to his face after almost running over a cat and meeting a crazy blonde girl. The girl he met obiviously has two different pesornalities hince the name of the book. I can understand how it could frustrate others especially the way the crazy blonde talks throughout the chapter but, I love it and can't wait to read the book.",I don't know what I just read. Maybe I should have read Me Myself and Why before reading this one.,"Humor humor,humor,humor,humor...ah did I mention humor.  One of funniest stories I have had the pleasure to read. If it had been 500 pages longer I would have given it five stars","Glad it was free. I will not be buying the book. The female character was too far out there mentally, and the male plumber needs his head examined. He should have run as fast as he could to get away from her, screw helping her get the cat out of the tree.","I would not recommend anyone read this first even though it is a bit of a prequel. You need to already understand the characters for it to make sense. There are no great revelations, it is just a bit of fun. Not necessary, just a quick flashback for fun.",Awesome read from one of my fav authors on this sneak peek.  Cant wait to read the full story when I order it,a short and free prequel written by mary janice davidson which showcases her quirky humor involving a female lead and a male plumber.,a short and free prequel which can be confusing to some. not much character development but has some funny parts.,"this free kindle book is a prequel but can be confusing if you read it first, before knowing the characters. it is a quirky and fun read.",
B0043RTJEY,"not complete protection, front plate cover won't stay on. 3rd cover i purchased in last 4 months from 3 different people","I never leave reviews, but I cannot figure out how to contact the seller and am extremely unhappy. I have now purchased two of this. The first one broke after about a month, but I figured it was because I was rough with it and took the case on and off a lot. I decided to buy another one. This one broke within a week. I was sure to use extra care with it (which I shouldn't have to, it's a case!). I wish I could find a way to contact the seller and get a refund. POOR quality for the price paid!","This is a fantastic case. I've dropped my phone countless times and its never broken. Also it keeps your phone safe from scratches and cosmetic damages! I love this case, plus its pink :) I've never had a more protective case. For a cheap price too. At the at&t store they wanted 69.99 for this same case in black. I paid 25 on amazon.com","I bought this case because I had heard nothing but great things about them. However, I had mine for a couple months and I dropped it 5 inches onto a workout gym floor, which are padded. The top portion flew off and the bottom portion cracked. I then called Otterbox and they replaced it... I had the second one for maybe a week before the top portion broke in the same spot the last one did. So therefor I say this product is not worth the 30 bucks it cost.",This case fits to the Torch like a glove and does not hinder slider operation AT ALL.  Offers solid protection to the phone and looks great too.  Am very glad I bought it and would recommend to anyone.,"I bought this case for my new Blackberry Torch.  I bought this case because it came highly recommended from the reps at the store.  I had it for less than a week when the top portion cracked completely in two.  And, it's not like I dropped my phone or something like that.  It cracked after just carrying it in my purse.  This case is a cheap piece of crap that is not worth the money!!",We have had this case less than 2 weeks. Yesterday my daughter dropped her phone and the faceplate part snapped. I will NOT purchase it again nor recommend anyone else purchase it.,"I have read countless reviews knocking this case because supposedly the top cover breaks off easily. As for myself, I usually only use the touch screen (not keyboard) so this isn't a problem for me as I hardly ever open the slide phone (Torch). The few times I have, though, I can see how its very fragile so I take precaution. Honestly, for a case that's supposed to protect, this should be an issue but I love the color/look of it so I shrug it off. Overall, the aesthetics are great but protection is subpar. Also, the back is hard plastic which isn't safe for gripping and can easily slip out of your hand.","The product came as expected, everything is fine, the service is fast and satisfying.
Nothing that I can complain about but the color.
The color not as bright as it shows in the picture.. quite a disappointment.","I had to replace my previous cover because it was too smooth and I would drop my phone regularly.  This cover has a texture on the edges making it easier to hold on to when I am multi-tasking.  The cover makes the phone a bit bulkier, but it seems necessary to have some protection on the phone.  I would rather a bulky cover than having to pay to replace my broken blackberry!
The hot pink girly color is pretty great too. :o)","i purchased this case in hopes to protect my precious new phone from my general clumsiness and constant exposure to hairspray. however, my hopes were promptly dashed a few days later when i put this case into full use.
i was unable to remove the tab-sticker from the screen protecting film and it 1) left tons of air bubbles under the film 2) left a ton of glue/paper from the useless peel tab sticker. The next day my phone endured its first drop and the tiny piece of plastic holding the case's faceplate to the front of the phone was snapped and no longer would hold on. The following day the film peeled right off the screen and i was left with half a case, and the most vulnerable part of the phone exposed :( sad day. i wish something silicone could accommodate this style phone.","I have to treat this otter box with as much care as I treat my phone.  I purchased this otter box with the intentions of being a little bit more care free with my phone.  I knew that otter box carried that reputation because my mother has one for her iPhone.  It's just not the same quality.  I giving it 2 stars because it's pink and looks good on my phone, the back cover is sturdy, and when the front piece of my case broke, I got another sent to me with no hassle.",I purchased this product for my daughter & she has been very pleased with it. I was very satisfied with how my order was processed & mailed out quickly. I would very much reccommend the Blackberry Torch Otterbox.,I read several negative reviews about this case and how the front does not stay on.  I have had mine for over a month now with no problems what so ever.  I drop my phone a lot and am really glad I got this case.  The only reason I gave it a 4star instead of 5 is because there is no perfect product to protect a slider phone.,"I am a big fan of Otterbox cases and I like that they have come out with a ""slimmer"" version in different colors! This case was easy to install thanks to the ""how to video"" on Otterbox.com and I love the screen protector! The pink/white case looks great with my white Blackberry Torch. Thanks Otterbox!","The product itself is well made, has nice colours and beautiful aesthetics, however the top cover is pretty delicate and tends to break pretty easily if not taken precaution. It has an affordable price which makes it accessible to the majority of people even tho it often presents few problems.",The cover does not give adequate protection. It is really difficult to reach the seller as they are unresponsive.,"the case fits the product perfectly and it's really nice to hold. it arrives quickly and has a good customer service. however, the colours are not as bright as they seem in the description page.",
B0044MPB2W,This phone cover is an excellent buy. The designs are super cute with bold colors accented perfectly with some sparkle. The plastic is not very thick (so not the most durable) but the pieces snapped together for a solid fit. Great item for the price!,It does a great job of protecting the phone. I am a huge klutz and drop my phone all the time and the cover doesn't even come off. That being said the cover is very hard to get off if you need to remove it. I like the design of the cover but it does have white borders everywhere it curves under. The photos do show that but it's something I just wasn't paying enough attention to. Overall I would recommend it.,"it was as beautiful on my phone, as it was in the picture! VERY pleased with this purchase! The only thing I would change, would be the ease of taking it on and off of my phone","I love this phone case, and get compliments on it every day, but after having to take it off and put it back on several times (taking the battery out when my phone freezes, cleaning, etc) the case has become compromised and doesn't snap into place as tightly. Will probably have to replace soon, but it's been fun to have - the design is so cool! And the price was definitely right!","This product was not what I expected it do be, but I was still good. I was a little dissapointed that the paint had chipped off in a few places around the button cut outs. However, I did receive several compliments from coworkers.",pretty awesome took a while to come because of hurricane sandy but was great. pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty,"beautiful case, really cheap only issue is when you drop ur phone the case pops off sometimes, annoying but still protects the phone. i would definitely recommend it.","But the pattern wears off very easily. The design is already rubbed off on the corners and the white plastic underneath shows. Oh well, it was cheap.","Pros:
cute pattern
sturdy
inexpensive
protects phone well when dropped
fits phone well

Cons:
pattern peels off easily
case is difficult to remove from phone","It is a very pretty case; has a unique, retro ""90's"" Afro-centric feel to it. It was exactly as displayed , a black case with a shimmery-silver touch to it and colorful geometric swirls and zigzags. Other people talk about getting THEIR cases from mall kiosks for about 19.99 per case, and I love to reply saying ""Well, I got mine for 38 cents on Amazon.com"". Jaw dropping, regretful reactions. Love love LOVE it. I am a satisfied customer. (-:",This case is just as pictured and goes on easily but it is thin plastic and feels like it will snap in two when you try to take it off. I've only had it two  Weeks and the graphics are already scratching off in several spots. I do like it for the fact that its less slippery then my last cover so I don't drop my phone as often.,This product did NOT fit my phone model as stated. It was made of the cheapest material and this was the worst experience I have ever had ordering anything!!,It is a very sturdy case that will protect my phone the only thing is the colors are different from the picture. like the background looks like it would be a black sparkle but its an ugly gray. oh well it works tho.,"Looks cheap and has A LOT of sparkles and glitter. Not that it comes off, but it's just not as nice as the picture.","Tons of compliments on this case - fast shipping, came in excellent shape, good customer service and availability, item was as it was described in the product description",This phone case is very affordable and has nice design and colors. The case is hard to to remove and since the plastic quality is not the best it can get dammaged with time but it protect your phone well.  you will get compliments on it but it is going to peel off quite quickly.,"this phone cover is an excellent buy, its design also so good but this material is good and cheap sometimes it is not fit my phone ,this pattern can so good but some paint is fault in this product. this services is so good .",the phone cover looks was awesome and pretty one. but the corner of the product is one of the drawback for this product and the grip is of very low quality,
B0046SHQG8,"Great headphones for the most part with decent sound quality for the price.  These are a good replacement for the Apple headphone but it your looking for these headphones for just music...look somewhere else.  This is for Apple headphone replacement...nothing more, nothing less.",Those blue plastics a really brittle and glued on. The earbuds sounded good but only lasted about a month. the non tangle cord really just means that it kinks if twisted which might have broken the internal wire leading to their malfunction. It was either that or the poor junction of the cord and the jack; it is not reinforced for the sake of style (like many mac cords).,"These work well, and fit my ear, but they don't last. After a few weeks the connections start to go bad. First I get intermittent sound on one side, and eventually is gone. The problem is near the plug.","The sound quality was a nice surprise. I had ordered these for purposes of listening to audiobooks.  I assumed that such a small headset in this price range would not be good enough for music listening, but this has surpassed my expectations.  Music sounds beautiful, crisp, full range (or close enough).

I had difficulty keeping the ear-buds in my ears. They kept sliding out of my ears, even when sedentary.  I wish there was some way to adjust the fit.  I have better luck with the other type, that hooks over the top of the ear.  However, when I wear sunglasses, that type that hooks over the ear does not stay on my ears, because the sunglasses are resting on top of my ears, of course.  I have not yet found the perfect headset fit for portable music listening.

The cord is described as tangle-free.  It may be tangle resistant, tangling less than some headsets, but is not totally tangle free.

Overall rating is very good, taking the price into consideration.","If you like the horrible earphones that Apple ships with their audio products (iPods & iPhones), then these are the perfect replacements for you.

These ear buds are big and round--about the diameter of a penny--not the in-ear buds that have become more popular in the past few years. You need big huge ear holes to fit these into your ears. They are rigid with no flex or padding. If you can comfortably fit a penny in your ear, then maybe these will work for you.

The sound is comparable to the Apple earphones (not great). It's hard to get better sound when they don't seat in or on your ears very well. The microphone is decent.

I hate to be so ""blah"" about a product. I know there is a segment of the market that likes this style of earphone. If that's you, then these should satisfy you. Otherwise, I would avoid these earphones and keep shopping.

WARNING: Don't put a penny in your ear. It's bad for you.","These work great.  Sound quality is awesome and the mic works great.  The only problem: I ordered these hoping they would work with my non-iDevices.  While the headphones and mic do indeed work, the ""call answer"" button does not work for any of my devices.  I do not own an iPhone, but I do own a iPod with a VoIP app and the call answer button still does not work.  The button does not work for my verizon phone, either.  I knocked off one star for this because you would think it would match the generic call answer button for all phones, but it doesn't.  I guess I need to learn a little more about cell phone button programming.  I figure if there can be a generic bluetooth call answer button, then why can't there be a generic hard-line call answer button?  Otherwise, good pair of stereo headphones/mic!","Nothing special, just okay, had high expectations but...oh well. Tangles more than the ordinary earphones. Didnt like in ear types thats why i didn't opt to get 216 model",Firstly the company has a five day return/refund policy. Needless to say after ordering it took nearly seven days to receive it. But upon opening it and using it for two days they completely stop working. A lesson learned never again.,"My daughter stole these from me and now won't give them back. When I had them it was great sound, comfortable fit and the mic worked great in the car. They are certainly better than the standard Apple earphones. I wish I had them back.",Microphone and pause/play button work on Samsung Galaxy GS3. Sound quality was much better compared to the headphones that came with the phone. Overall good purchase for the price.,Bought a pair for my daughter then just got these for myself.  Great quality sound and comfort.  The cord is great and doesn't stick and tangle.  Highly recommended...,"I used these for a few months and then the headset controls just stopped working one day. Sound was good but the headset controls are why I bought them, so another set of headphones in the trash. I am still looking for a good quality set of headphones with headset","This is the second pair I bought from them, same model. The first one lasted about 2 years. Can't go wrong w/ the price, pretty decent.","I was delighted to receive my new Planatronics head phones.

As a person who runs three to five miles a few times each week, I enjoy listening to music, in particular my old rock and roll songs, on my iPod Shuffle. This helps to pass the time in the longer runs.

Runnjing to the music of Tallahasse Lassie sung by Freddy Cannon, or Dancing Queen byu ABBA or even Garth Brooks belting out Friends in Low Places, definately helps me keep a good pace.

My prior headphones seemed adequate but these stereo headphones allow me to hear the music better. The sounds come out louder and without the static I had noticed.

The ear phones fit my ears adequately and are sharp looking with a silver circle on the back of the ear phone that looks classy.

This is comparable to most smartphones and allows the user to talk through the inline mic.

I'm most happy with my new head phones and definatly recommend them to users of other headphones who would like an upgrade.","I really like these earphones! Got them because of a daily special, was not disappointed!  I was quite impressed! I really cherish these, very nice!",great headphones and has good sound quality. and the product has average quality and best sound quality. the fitting of the headphone should be increased. this is not stick and tangle. overall a good product for this price and this unique with its features but last for only few months.,"these headphones function well but may not last a long time. they can replace apple headphones. the fit is good. there is a nice silver circle on the back. they have a mic, controls, and a tangle-free cord.","the planatronics head phones have a good sound quality. they look classy. the downside is that they malfunction after a while, and they no longer work.",2 disagreements

I gave the company a two star seller feedback and they contacted me that night to resolve the issue. They told me that they would send me out a new USB cable and that i should look for an e-mail with instructions. They then slipped in that i should reconsider my seller feedback, which i would gladly change if the issue was resolved.

Really sturdy. Will buy again in different color.  My wife loves it and she is really picky.,"As is everyone else, I was looking for that perfect case for my iPhone 4S.  I wanted something to protect the glass from getting scratched (front and back) while being slim enough to still fit in my pocket and have some grip.  This does that, however, there are two things that keep me from really liking this case.  One is the back has a peak down the center which prevents it from laying flat on a table or desk.  This will allow the phone to move around if you try and use it while laying on it's back.  The second problem, and the bigger of the two, is the flash back when using the camera with the flash.  There is a lot of pick up that really washes out the picture forcing you to have to remove the case if you want to have good pics.

The case is OK and some may not mind these issues but I have already ordered another case in hopes of getting what I want out of one.","the plastic around the volume buttons broke off, don't drop it because then the clips inside the case will break and the case won't stay on. not very protective for your phone. if you take a picture with flash, remove the case or your pictures won't turn out good.","I love this case - this is my 3rd one and I always go with this one.
I am Very hard on my cases - I drop my phone often.  (which is why i am on my 3rd one) and The phone still looks brand new!
the corners of the case chip and scratch but take a hard beating.  It eventually will chip off a whole piece and doesn't click together to stay on - but they have lasted me many months each!
I do not like the Otter box because it is too bulky....  This is slim and very protective","I've had Case Crown covers on my 3gs for years and got great results. Then I got this one for my 4gs. I broken the bar on the front bottom so I ordered one more. Needless to say, that one broken right away also. So I broke down and got the new Otter Box.",I love this case!  I've had it on my phone for about 2-3 months and I always get compliments on how nice it looks.  It's very sturdy (I've dropped it a few times). I would definitely recommend this case!,"This was a cheap case I purchased for someone else.
They seemed to like it a lot.
It's better than not having any protection","I had this case since early November of 2011. Since then, my phone has gone through lot of traumas: falling on an asphalt, dropping on my desk, dropping on living room (wood flooring), etc. Every time these traumas occurred, this case did its job; and it did it well! The case took the impact on every fall and my phone, especially the screen, was never damaged.

Just a heads up. This case isn't perfect as other reviewers mentioned. After awhile (and few drops) left-top corner doesn't snap in 100%, paint fades here and there, etc, but I consider those as normal wear and tear. Left-corner not snapping in 100% will not compromise the integrity/sturdiness of the case. So after 8+ months of use and abuse, I'm happy with this case and glad that I bought it! [Watch out for those cheap generics!]",I returned this case it was very flimsy. I was afraid to even use it in fear it would not protect my new phone.,Good slim case for my iphone 4s does not add too much bulk and has good access to all ports and buttons. The case also has a rubbery feel to it and slips in and out of the pocket easily. Multiple colors are available to suit your taste.,"There are millions of case options these days and this one does a great job of protecting the phone when dropped.  I've dropped it with this case at least 5 times and it never came apart or cracked.  It's also pretty thick which I'm not a huge fan of. I prefer cases that are slim and have a bit of a rubberized coating to prevent it from slipping out of my hand in the first place.

Overall if you like the looks of it then it's a great buy.",I bought this case because it 'looks' really cool but within days of using it the bottom piece broke off in my pocket and couple of days later the side broke while I was trying to remove it to take a picture because the flash reflects from the case and flushes out the Photo.  Don't waste your money on this case.,"it's a good case, it fits well on the phone, it's beautiful and it's low cost, but it's fragile and may not be resistant to impacts, in addition, it's necessary to remove the case to take pictures with flash.",this is a good cheap case for iphone. it protects the iphone well and it looks good and has a nice tight fit on the phone. overall it's a good purchase,"This is a slim and snug phone case for the iPhone. It is lightweight and attractive. However, some have complaints that due to the thinness certain parts of the case break off easily. It has received very mixed reviews.",
B004EYI02S,"I purchased this Bluetooth maybe a week or two ago and it is not working. I can hear the parties on the other end of the phone, but they cannot hear me! I am very displeased. My plans are to return the Bluetooth ASAP. The echo-cancellation and noise reduction is a great feature and it works well. Maybe I received a used one, but I requested and paid for a new one. Whatever the case maybe, I will be returning this Bluetooth. Not Cool!",When I received my bluetooth in the mail I was so excited but that soon turn to disappointment when the little thingy that you put around your ear wasn't really stable it has a little rubbery piece inside the earclip  circle where you can change it from right to the left ear:that piece is not glued in at all... it keeps falling out falling apart. It doesnt stay on the Bluetooth itself as it should and its just a hassle! The wrap around piece could have had more flexibility as well.,I love it. Excellent buy. Could not be happier with it. Was what I thought and much more. Thank you,"I really do love this bluetooth its easy to set up and not hard to use, the only thing i do not like about it, is the ear piece that i cannot seem to get on right, but other than that it's an awesome piece for my phone","Had too much trouble with this. It felt too heavy, sometimes the signal wouldn't connect, and I spent a good bit of cash on it... Wasn't too pleased...","It works well for me. Yes the hook for the ear could be a little better, but it works fine.",Its the best blue tooth I have ever owned and I have had about 6 different ones searching for the best I found it in this Blue Tooth.,I have been enjoying my bluetooth. For the money it does a very good job. It serves the purpose for what I wanted it for.,"The people to whom I speak find the sound quality good, but I find the audio quality just not loud enough. I also was unhappy that were no directions at all for its use. The only instruction was for pairing it with my cell phone, although that was helpful.","When I first got it,  the rubber that connects to the Bluetooth  fall apart but I asked them for a replacement piece and now it's nice and steady. It was easy to pair with my devices and doesn't take up too much room. It also comes with a usb, wall adapter, and car charger. All in compact size (:  for me I give it 5 stars. What may be implemented to make this product even better is replacement parts as a backup to eliminate any issues with the device being accessible.",The ear piece on this just won't stay on. It's very hard to adjust.  Am now using one my friend gave me.  Sorry I wasted my money. Instructions were also very bad.  Looks like someone tried to write the instructions in English.,"The cheap plastic ear hook ring snapped the first day I used it. This made it useless immediately. Don't know if I'll even contact AMICA ELECTRONICS because I know they have heard this before and don't care. But I would pay extra for a sturdy ear hook ring because that's the only thing that makes hold.

Sad.

And no, I could never recommend this product even though computer is my major that I will graduate in June at Georgetown University with.

Lesson Learned.",not pleased with them. first day one broke when took it out of package.another one broke the earpiece a few weeks later. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. They are poorly made.,its for the husband he says its okay,came broke and even try to make it work with my galaxy note 3 and didn't work ... i will need credit,easy to use but easy to break. not made with the best quality. seems to only work with certain phones.,The Bluetooth sound quality is good. but battery backup very low. no directions at all for its use,"This bluetooth headset has good sound quality, nice features such as noise cancelling, and come with 3 different chargers. However the plastic ear hook that maintain the headset brake easily and almost instantly making the headset almost impossible to use.",
B004JZFWVO,This case fits my new verizon iphone like a glove.  Looks pretty too!  The case keeps my iphone safe and very easy to use all buttons on the phone.  Great purchase and price!,"I received my case mate case and it had obviously been used and was black not pink and gray.

There were numerous Scratches on the back and signs of general wear. I toyed  with the notion of sending it back, but it wasn't so THAT bad and I am far too busy to deal with the hassle. That being said, it's a fine case.

Very sturdy, good shock resistance and easy to get in and out of pockets. I wish there was more front protection, but the slim design outweighs that minor flaw. Over a good product.","I have had this case for a little over a week.  It's a wonderful case...slides easily into my pocket...easy to grip...etc.  My one complaint is that the rubber on the sides of the case is beginning to show some wear.  It won't affect the usefulness but it does look a little worn.  The pink color is a little more bubblegum pink than in the picture but in my opinion, it's a pretty color and looks nice with the grey.  I would recommend this cover.",The case is very durable.  The silicon stops the phone from sliding and the hard case protects the phone really well.,"I have had a couple of Otterbox cases, and this one by far is much better.  I love this case.  It protects my phone, isn't too bulky, isn't difficult to put on the phone, and I like the look.","So...I love the case. It's comfortable and looks nice,. All the buttons and plug-in areas are easy to access. HOWEVER, part of the case split after three months of gentle use. I didn't drop it, pull on it, and I never took it off after putting it on. I'm not happy about that.

I'll buy one more and hope I got a defective one the first time. We'll see.",The case lives up to the description and is much cheaper online than in stores. Protective yet smooth enough to go in and out of my pocket easily.,"When I received the case, I was disappointed to see that it did not come with the advertised screen protection kit. I contacted the seller, and they advised that they never received the kits from case-mate. They then offered a small, partial refund. I received the item in good time from the seller. Unfortunately, this is one of the sellers that requires you to pay shipping, even when purchased through Amazon.

The case itself is very nice, and I am very pleased with it. The case is not at all bulky, the rubber sides have a nice feel, and the pink is very pretty. The case is made for the Verizon iphone 4, and fits the Verizon buttons perfectly. After two days of use, the back of the case does have a few scratches, but that may be common among all the hard plastic cases. With this case, just know that you will have to order your own screen protector.","This is an excellent case.  It's not too bulky and fits the Verizon iPhone 4 well.  The only problem is that the ""screen protection kit"" was not included with mine (purchased from DayDeals via Amazon.com) as described in the Product Description.  I contacted the seller and they said that ""Case-Mate must not have included it in the package"" and offered to send me a generic one.  I received the generic one and it was crap (cutouts for front camera etc. did not match the iPhone 4).

Update:  I recently purchased another one, this time directly from Amazon.com, and the screen protection kit was included.",The side switch doesnt match up with the att iphone but i still like it and use it. I bought it based off the colors,"The case itself is very nice, but in the picture it appears to be light pink with a light grey grip on the side which is indeed false. It is more of a hot, barbie kind of pink and the grip looks more black. Still a nice case, just watch the advertising.","When I saw this case online, the grey looks much lighter and the pink looks really cute and pale, and I have the line green and grey case of this brand and loved it so I ordered it. Upon receiving it however, the pink was more of a hot bright pink and the grey was practically black. I was not all that satisfied and it did not even fit my phone properly at the silencing switch even though it was ment for the iPhone I have.","Love this case! The grippers on the side are wonderful so I don't feel like I'm going to drop my phone! THe only problem I have had, is if I try to plug it into a dock, it isn't able to because it can't get in far enough because of the case. But, not a big deal in my case.","It's a great case. I had a white one before, took good care of my phone. When I got my new phone, they gave me top price for the old one. This case does it's job. They rubber grips on the side are a bonus. I just really like this case. It will not be my last one!",Side switch is out of reach for iphone 4s. It is hard to get in to turn switch on or off as hole in case is not aligned with phone.,this iphone case is really great and it's not too bulky but it protects the phone well. the grippers are wonderfully working.,the phone case is nice. it is comfortable to my phone. screen protection kit wast not included in this case. this is one of the problem. the rubber side have a nice feel to use this case.,"Buying product is iPhone case. Most of the reviews is positive. Some reviews tells color problem, scratch in back side, not fit to correctly, side button rough handling etc...Otherwise, this product looks like good...",
B004LZ576M,I enjoy true crime books and have read many and yet this one had several evil people I had not heard about and more information about others. Yes it is disturbing to read what people are capable of but still very fascinating.,"This book was bloated but interesting.

There were times when I was hooked and page turning like mad and other times when I felt bogged down in too many useless words.","Only buy this book for someone if you want them to have a lot of the wrong information.  In his introduction the author made slight sense, but it fell apart when I started reading about his first ""evil"" person and I noticed some information that was wrong (30 seconds with google and 2 ivy league college resources), I confirmed it.  If you want to present new or different information, please do... but don't forget proof or at least a reason for the conflicting facts.  Lastly,  it is extremely difficult to apply today's ideals on the ancient world, or even the world 200 years ago.  I feel that this is the author's biggest mistake.","Scary to know that there were enough people in the world to have a book written.  The atrocities again humanity is so evident,  From the serial killers to the mass murders, you see inside a black heart and ruthless demeanor.  I rated this a 5 not that I like the subject matter, but was able to glimpse inside their lives to see maybe how they became this way.  From Caligula, to hitler to people in the 21st century.  We get a glimpse of horror.  Great job","Too Sad for me to read, I know evil is alway around and it just too much to take a interest for me I really can't rate this,
Because it was too scary.","While the stories are interesting and chock full of facts, it is poorly written.  There's tons of people who are mentioned, and if you don't already know the story, you'd be lost because he doesn't explain who the people are.","This was a good book and it does well at describing the atrocities that these people committed, but it missing a few people like Khomeini, Francisco Solano Lopez, King John, Cromwell, Pizzaro, and Nero.  Other than that it has the most evil people in history.","I think the title is misleading, however very good historical context in it. I really enjoyed learning about some of the people I heard of but never knew for sure who they were. It was brought together nicely.",My Kindle was stolen and the sick person who stole it ordered this book.  I guess he would qualify as one of the most evil people.,"The book was interesting at most. Some of the people included should not be in the list. Can you really categorize Lenin as an evil man?

While some of the stories capture interest, most seem just a mish mash of facts assembled in no particular order.

You're better off spending a few hours in a library.",Did not know how many crazy people their were in positions of leadership from the beginning of time to the present.,"What can you say about evil?  I have not enjoyed this book at all due to the subject.  However, I read it for information only.","This book definitely worth the purchase price.  It covers quite a bit.  My only complaint is that it drags on in parts and starts to read like a history text book in others.  There are quite a few typos as well, which can be distracting, but otherwise, it's a good read.",I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very informative and gripping. I am excited to find more like it!,I absolutely loved this. There are a lot of historical characters and facts. I couldn't put it down. A well deserved 11/10,This book covers the evils in the world and evil acts that people have committed. It gives lots of information although it can be long for some.,It is an interesting and informative book particularly in history but it is lacking a few historical details,"it is an interesting book, very informative, but there are some typos and lack of information about several people mentioned in the book.",
B004MGCD0I,The case did not fit my phone and broke while trying to put it on.  The color was also faded.,This case looks cool but it didn't fit my phone correctly and it took about an hour to snap it on and then when i finally got it on and dropped it for the first time.... it broke. It also makes the phone bulkier than other cases i have had. It's cheap but i wouldn't recommend it.,The cover is very pretty. It fit my phone well and was easy to put on. I was impressed on how fast it shipped. I already ordered another one.,"Dont waste your money, even though its not much! I got this one and there was nothing good about it. It was cheap plastic, the picture chipped off withing the first two weeks or so and it did not protect my phone when i accidently dropped it, the screen was cracked...so much for being a shock absorbent product!! Dont waste your money unless you are an idiot!","I like this case. It fits the Thunderbolt perfectly. The design isn't quite as vivid as it looks in the picture.  It is very difficult to get off, but I guess that's good---it won't be falling off.  Seems to be good protection for the phone.",If I could give it no stars I would! It did not fit my phone (all of the corners would not snap at the same time) and it was very flimsy. The case has been on my phone for about a week. My phone has not been dropped or had anything done to it out of the ordinary and the case is already cracked and broken in two places. It does not even stay on my phone anymore. Do not buy this product... yes it is cheap but you get what you pay for.,Lasted for about 4 months before all of the tabs that hold the two halves together all broke off. You can't beat the price but just make sure you buy a few of them.,"The case is beautiful but does not close completely. I have the super screen protector on my phone and I think that is the reason it does not close. Even with the gap, the case fits and is secure.","I'm quite disappointed in this item,good thing it wasn't expensive clips broke and small piece on back broke already. It looks very attractive but not too functional in it's broken state.","I purchased this for my thunderbolt, not only did it not protect the unit, it caused a crack in my screen. Now I no longer own a that phone, because I tried to purchase a ""cheap"" cover to update the cover I purchased initially with the phone. Don't waste the money, it was an expensive lesson to learn.",The design is cute although it is not as bright as the picture that was shown. I didn't mind that but I thought I was getting a rubberized case (as it says in the title of the product). IT IS NOT RUBBERIZED. It is just cheap plastic that doesn't even fit the phone correctly. I can get everything snapped except one corner. I have spend half an hour putting the case on and struggling to get it back off to see if putting it together in a difference order will get that last corner to close. No luck. I'm debating if I should just return it but the postage would probably be more than the cost of the case. Lesson learned - you get what you pay for!!,"Made the phone thick & bulky and noticeably heavier.  Plastic didn't completely snap into place around phone, also design didn't match up at seams, and it ended up looking odd.","It's truly a beautiful case, and I'm confident that it will keep my phone protected. It also feels really smooth all around. I would definitely recommend it. Shipping was fast with Amazon Prime, so sign up if you haven't already! If you do plan on getting this case, get a screen protector to completely protect your phone from scratches.

Cheers","It seems to offer moderate protection to the phone (though I have yet to drop it and really test that theory, it does not feel cheap). It looks nice, does not add much bulk. My husband ordered a gel cover for his Thunderbolt and it is nice, too -- but it did cost more and I'm not sure how much better protection it will give (though I would agree that a gel would protect better as this could come apart if the phone were to fall...also, I think this looks nicer).",This case is perfect for the  Spring it is colorful and the texture is so soft yet durable. I love it and I have received many compliments..,"the case is beautiful and has a low cost, but there may be differences in sizes and it may not fit the phone well, in addition, the material is fragile and breaks easily.","this phone case is beautiful and attractive, but it is fragile and difficult to fit on the phone, making it not very durable.",the case is ascetically pleasing to the eye.  the case is for the thunderbolt and it is an extremely tight fit.  this case is made of plastic and the thickness of the case adds bulk to the phone.  this case is more decorative that protective.,2 disagreements
B004RE2HS8,"I love pink so of course, I liked this case when I seen it online. The only thing I really hate is the way it looks on the back of my phone, it looks as if the phone is stuck to the case in some spots, which looks like bubble and my phone has collected a lot of dust, as well as dirt using this case.","Fast delivery, came sooner than expected which was great. the case is ok no problem so far. The color wasn't two toned like in  the picture though it looked like a dull pink.","Received my case today and I am happy~ the material is flexible but seems like it will protect my phone well. The color is more of a neon pink  than is shown in the picture, but It's still a really nice color and it looks good on my white iPhone. I got a good case for only $2.00.","Doesnt look like the picture its  only  pink  and the red was missing.
Better of buying in stores and being happy",It is a nice color but the part of the lock button was too tight so it wouldn't let my lock button work properly,"The case is exactly as I expected, I have a purple one I purchased a while back and it's held up well.  I love the bright color and it definitely protects my phone from minor drops (oops, lol).  It's a good buy.","My aunt has a similar case for her iPhone 3GS and after searching for hours, finally found this one for my iPhone 4.  Received it today and am very pleased--the material is flexible but seems like it will protect my phone well, and I love the ridges on the sides, because I think they'll help me keep a good grip on the phone (haven't had much of a problem with this phone, but I was constantly dropping my previous one before I got a case on it!).  The color is more of a neon pink, with a bit of an orangish tone, than is shown in the picture, but I actually like this better, and it looks really good on my white iPhone.  Can't believe I got such a great case for two bucks!","Very cute case, fits perfect & the price was great!! The color was a little different then I expected but still like it.",I don't really like this case. The pink looks gorgeous on my white iPhone but the biggest problem was coverage and the way the back looked. The case sticks to the back of my phone which looks really unattractive like a shirt sticking to a sweaty body. As for the coverage on the phone...it could be better. It feels very flimsy but it's not all that surprising seeing as it was extra cheap. I probably won't be using this case...,Case feels nice in my hands and I can use all the buttons except the hold button ok. The hold button takes some force to push down but you get use to it. Great case,"Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, thought the case wouldve been a hard one, but nonetheless it is a very good case! :)","Love it , fast shipping . I have a sprint iPhone 4 and it fits perfectly find. Easy to take off and on . It such a very very bring pink lol but I love it still :)","This case looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture what so ever. the color, the material everything looks way different. doesn't even look like it'll protect the phone. it literally looks like something you can purchase at the dollar store, no wonder it's only a dollar. I do not recommend.",This case was just okay it would have been better if it was not hard to turn the phone off.,This looks and feels like the others I bought here on Amazon but I already had to throw it away because the back side separated. I have 3 phones all with different colors of the same (maybe - bought separately on Amazon) that have all been on the same amount of time,"This phone case is well constructed, flexible with a good grip and is somewhat protective at a great price.  It is not perfect however.  A few of the buttons are difficult to use when the case is on and the color isn't exactly as described in the ad. It will stick to your phone which may give an undesired look to the back.","while the pink case is not the exact color that shows on the pi\picture, the case is still nice, although some parts of it are flimsy.","This is an affordable good looking neon pink phone case. The material is flexible, fits easliy, and protect the phone from minor drops. be careful because the picture can be misleading especially for the color and the material type. The hold button is harder to press with the case on.",
B004U349UA,"I really loved this story.  Usually, when I get a short story, I don't expect much but Second Ward sucked me in. I loved the twist at the end and can't wait to read the authors other stories.  I love finding new author's this way!","I agree with another reviewer who wrote this is very juvenile writting. The story was so predictable that it read like a poor ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Don't waste you time on this one.","This book is proof that there needs to be some kind of a gatekeeper preventing self-published slumlords from throwing together 10 pages of drivel and putting it up on the Kindle without any kind of proofreading or quality control.

Return this one to the self-publishing slush-pile it came from.  Yuck.","What would you give to avoid the reality of life?  What would your psyche do when it can no longer handle the truth about what or who you are?  Here is one such answer, wrapped in a short story - complete with a head jarring ending.","This first draft of a short story is a good effort for a first-time author, but needs much work before it's ready to be released to the public.  The numerous typos and punctuation errors and occasional grammatical mistakes are annoying, but not show-stoppers.  The main problem is in the storytelling:  the character development, logical plot development, tension, dialog, too much telling instead of showing, explaining the plot resolution to the reader, etc.

The storytelling indicates ""very early days"" in this author's professional career, but shows promise, and I expect that with continued practice, this author's stories will be worth reading in a few years.

To summarize the plot, Jason is a teenaged patient in a mental hospital, but right away the reader realizes Jason's experience is atypical.  He doesn't seem to belong there, and his recurring nightmares may hold clues to why he's a patient.  There's more than meets the eye, and the reader is compelled to keep turning pages to find the answers to this mystery.","I anticipated a lot based on the high ratings this short story received.  However, I found myself wondering about the development of the story.  It felt like it could have used a rewrite and good editing job.  The premise is interesting, but I felt the transition between being in the ward and then waking up to the true reality was too abrupt and disconnected me from the story.  I really didn't connect with this story on any level that held my attention.","The author does a great job with character dialogue, setting the stage for the main story, and making you feel like you were the main character of the story vs. some gray-haired guy reading away on the Kindle - then the author does a complete 180 with a great ending I didn't see coming. This was a very good short story / novella that I could realistically see as a full-length novel in order to develop more of the story.

As I type this review, this book is free in the Amazon Kindle store - I enjoyed it so much I would have paid for it, and will look for more from this author. If you are looking for an enjoyable story, I highly recommend this one!","I'm really glad this was only a short story because to me, it was sure depressing! The story itself was kind of interesting but the ending fell flat. I dislike reading books (or ebooks) with misspellings and grammatical errors.  This one had its share although not as many as some others I have read.  There were sentences that started out in the past tense and changed to present tense, unneeded or missing apostrophes, misspelled words and words used incorrectly. As for the story--it held my interest somewhat but then it ended and I almost wished I hadn't read it.

SPOILERS:

In his memory, his mother is nice yet in the end she's apparently horrible since she is the person he thought was the meanest. That made no sense to me. The whole ending made no real sense because who would rather be in an insane asylum (whether for real or in your mind) than to be free? I guess this book just wasn't for me.  I'd rather read something that isn't so dark.","It's a short story, which means the author has to limit the amount of words used to develop the story, but, I would have liked a bit more details to explain the setting. I can't go in to more detail about my lingering questions without giving too much away.

For an early work this story shows a good deal of promise. I will be looking to see what else this author has written.","Jason is a patient in a mental hospital.
He dreams nightmares and is given shots to tranquilize him and strapped down in an isolation ward to protect him from himself.
Jason is dreaming the dreams of an adult... but he is a teenager. Something is wrong.

This is an extremely well-written story that captures the reader and keeps the reader's attention until the end of the story.

I will definitely be on the lookout for more writing by this author.

More of a read for adults, not YA.","Quite a good story, I should say.  It presents a form of escapism for one who has gone through a traumatic experience; and with all the mysteries surrounding the human mind, I think it is very plausible.  I appreciate the twist at the end, but I would have liked it better if there were more of ""what happened next"".  But I guess the author left it for the book clubs to discuss.  Another good discussion point would be the representation of the other characters at Greenlawn.","I found this to be an amazingly creative story.  It truly does make you wonder what our minds are capable of in order to keep us from suffering the realities of life. If I was in this boys position, I don't know if I would have tried to solve the mystery.  Is a simple and controlled existence better than a complete unknown?  That is for you to decide.  I find think this is a great story that makes us think...What if?
Happy Reading.
DawnBee <3","I'd give it a 4.5, with the 1/2 star off for the typos/editing concerns.  The story itself is quite compelling and I did not find those concerns enough of a distraction to warrant rounding down.  Truly the word I choose for this story is 'compelling'.  There are few stories out there that stay with me over the years and this will be one of them.

The writer draws you into the main character and gradually unfolds the details of how he found himself with limited memories and in 'the second ward' of an apparent psychiatric hospital--where he has supposedly resided from the ages of 9 through to near adulthood.  As a reader I was tantalized with details--wondering why certain things were a certain way (I don't want to do any spoilers here...) and everything that seemed 'off' in a description was understandable in the end.

This is definitely NOT something I would normally read and yet this will be finding itself in my 'unexpected gem' collection on my Kindle.

Highly Recommended (even though I did not chuckle even once!)

JTG","The story itself was not bad, however the grammatical errors made it hard for me to enjoy it as I cringed every time ""breathe"" was used in place of ""breath"". I can see how others would enjoy this more if they weren't prone to noticing things like this.

I also didn't care for how Joe went from saying ""Sorry, I really need this job!"" one day, to knocking out his fellow workers as if it didn't matter the next day.

With a little work this would probably be a much more enjoyable read.","This story is intriguing. I loved the creativity of it, but the writing was not very good. Too many grammatical mistakes: incorrect punctuation, run on sentences, improperly placed clauses. Lots of potential, but it would have benefited from a really good editor.","Grammatical errors and typos spoil what is otherwise an interesting read. It is at least worth a look, if only because the premise is intriguing.","the story has a lot of grammar errors. the story is more for a mature audience, as it has traumatic points. a good ending that has the earlier parts of the story come together",An interesting yet rough story about escapism and overcoming illness  While the Second Ward has a lot of issues the story is interesting enough to draw anyone in. Well worth the Read.,
B004VMZZ3K,"A very useful and interesting and had had one in the past but now give it away and went back to buy 2 one for me and one for a nephew who is delighted with his S5260, this product can be bought cheap and necessary for me and my nephew, I recommend buying it.","I tried plugging in an AT&T SIM, but getting a message 'Phone Freeze'. Does this means that phone is locked? I expected an unlocked phone.

I got the unfreeze code from the customer service.",I LOVE THIS PHONE BUT WHEN I WENT TO REGISTER THE WARRANTY SAMSUNG DECLINED AND SAID IT WAS CREATED FOR THE UK SO THEY WOULD NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY IN THE US.I THINK THAT SAMSUNG SHOULD STAND BEHIND THERE PRODUCT WHERE EVER IT IS.,"This cell phone worked well except for one major feature that I really needed.  The blue tooth connections between the phone and my other blue tooth devices would constantly drop.  I complained to the seller, an Amazon's merchant, and I was sent a replacement.  The replacement had the exact same problem.  So, I am now using my old Nokia cell phone which works perfectly when paired to my car speaker phone and my headset.  The seller now ignores my requests for a refund, saying that I am a few weeks too late.  So, if pairing with other devices is something that you need, this cell phone will not stay connected for more than a few minutes.  Sometimes it will reconnect but then disconnect a short time later.","It's working! I buyed this phone to my daughter about 6 months ago and I am satisfied, this phone met her requirements. Its has camera, music & video players, games and some others applications like a Translator and The Bible. She is happy and me too.","I think it's an excellent product, is a very good buy because it meets all my expectations. Highly recommended. Thanks",The phone is very sensitive to touches.  Often my finger toughes the wrong button.  I plan to get a new phone from T Mobil,I am very pleased with the purchase of this product. This cell phone is very good and comfortable to use. I recommend this seller. Greetings from Ecuador,"Sorry to say this phone didn't work for me.  From the beginning, out of the box, the phone said ""Phone Freeze SIM unavailable. Contact your service provider"".  I tried my AT&T sim card, my husbands (AT&T), and one (AT&T) borrowed from a friend out of her IPHONE.  Got the same message on all three, even after a tech from the seller told me how to reset the phone.  I even called AT&T and to my surprise, the lady I talked to said that my sim card should work in any phone.  Wish it had worked, the other features looked like it would be a fun phone to have.  I must say that the seller was prompt and courteous when I emailed them about the problem.  Unfortunately, the phone is packed up and ready to be shipped back tommorrow.",The phone had more features in it than how it was described in the details which was a great thing and it's very user friendly. My little brother didn't have a hard time getting used to it.,"A nice phone, although a little pricy. It works right out of the box, and it works well both in and out of the US. WIFI function is particularly nice so that I don't need to sign up for data service with my carrier, and trapped into a 2 years agreement. One problem I have with this phone is that it's not set up w/ my carrier to send and receive multimedia text messages. It would have been nice if it came with an instruction to help to set up multimedia text messages with major carriers in the US, if it's sold here.","it has all the features I need like.. phone, internet and camera. work great on English only. can not add more languages","Phone package arrived with an international version of charger(plug doesn't fit into U.S. outlet). Had to buy a generic one from a retailer for additional $11. No USB cable included. Touch sensitivity is average. Youtube streaming works well, ave. buzz time is under 3 sec. for a song, although picture quality is terrible.  Internet surfing is almost impossible-Not Enough Memory msg. keeps popping up; even after all cookies, cache, etc. were deleted & all other programs were closed. FB works OK.

The most annoying thing about this phone is that it doesn't always flip to the landscape screen when you continuously flip the phone. When it flips, it went right back to the (portrait) format.

Overall, it's an average phone for the price. You get what you paid for, I guess.","It is an excellent product that does what it has provided on the page, Congratulations on the quality of the product and its features","This phone is so expensive looking, the wifi is a plus feature unfortunately the instruction manual is in German and also the charger is so funny that is also for a foreign outlet.

Items was suppose to arrive to me no later than Jan 6.  Needless to say I contacted the seller, left a negative feedback, and still no case. Worst service I ever receive from a seller on the Amazon market. Sad thing is this case was for my son, everyone receive their cases (different seller) and he was without one. Very disappointed because they are the only ones that sells this color case on Amazon. Wish I could give them negative stars.","Its a nice solid case, only problem is that it is more of a dark pink then a red. It is no where near as red as the color in the pic. Its still not bad though. High quality case for a good price. You may want to consider like a blue though, unless your looking for a really light red.",The case is decorative and provides moderate protection. The shipping is fast. The product fits snug to the phone.

The cell phone is no exception.  It is easy to setup and on the Sprint network in minutes.,"I ordered this phone on Amazon, through Just Cellular. I ordered the new phone but it did not come in its original box, it does not look brand new, it did not come with the manual book for the phone, and it did not come with its original phone charger, the charger is different and only about 2 feet long, very short compared to normal chargers, its the cheap charger that they have for sell for $5, so I guess they take the nice one out of the box from your new phone and give you the cheap crappy charger so they can sell the other one for a better price, not sure. It did ship on the 4th of the 3 to 5 day business shipping days so that was good. So far the phone is working well but if I need another phone I will not be ordering it through Just Cellular, and I would advise others not to as well",As far as phones go it is pretty nice easy to use .. However buyer beware it is considered a smartphone and requires a data package.. not just a texting one.. the sprint people at first told my daughter it didn't but they changed my plan to data so upon deeper investigation I found out that it was in fact a smartphone.. so as far as phones go it is a great buy for the money but only if you want a full data package.,"Good phone, everything was as expected-new, excellent condition-no issues-great phone for the price.  call, text, email  and watch ESPN on it.","don't buy, the quality is awful and it has already broken. it IS a smart phone, even though amazon  will tell you no, so cell bill went up double",The phone arrived on time and was in great working condition.

There customer service is wonderful. My order never showed up so i contacted customer service and they sent me another one right away!!!","I put this case on as soon as I received the package. it looks so beautiful, and  the designs stand out. It look almost kind of 3D.  I would recommend this case to anyone who wants to give their infuse a new look. Thanks","The design and feel of the material is really lovely. Unfortunately, the case comes in two pieces, one that fits over the front and snaps into the backing. There is the worst, rough-feeling plasticky seam where the two pieces meet. It happens to be right where your fingers are when you hold the phone. The phone is uncomfortable to hold now and I'm disappointed. Less importantly, the design doesn't match up between the two pieces of the cover.

I had to shave away the extra plastic which was time consumming. Did not like having to work on a new item in order for it to work properly",excellent time and quality keep doing like this i recomended you with 5 stars and im going to buy more stuff,This crap was broken when I got it but because my mother wanted to keep it & it took you soooooooooo long to get it to me she just kept it. I won't b ordering anything else like this ever again!!! REAL TALK!!!,Well worth the price.. If u ever take off the case out can't put it back on! Also I thought it was black it was a dark grey not like the picture. Holographic kinda so I give props for that.

B0052CHOS2,"I went from original iPhone to a Blackberry Bold and then back to iPhone 4. I have always said that the only think that I really liked about the BB was the raised keyboard and the thing I dislike the most about the iPhone is the virtual keyboard. And now I can have the best of both!

Excellent service. Received it within a few days of ordering! Very easy to hook up with Bluetooth and pretty basic/easy to use. The negatives for me are: auto capitalization does not work when using keyboard and there's only one shift key and it's on the left side. Other than that, I really like it.

Anyhow, I like it. It's easy. And it looks cool!","I bought this device a while back and never wrote a review. Figured I would get around to it now. I bought this to have the feel of buttons as many iPhone users miss. In the end, the buttons worked great and the quality was better than I expected but not having the spell check option became too annoying. Maybe a new iOS will help make this product better and allow for it. Overall I felt the product was as advertised and if you are way more accurate than I am, you might like this product.","So i get my package in the mail, and i am very excited, but when i open it, i find that they sent me a cheap keyboard that does not light up or anything, or even slide out.. its the TK- 421 keyboard and it twists out from the side and the keys are much bigger and bulkier.. needless to say i will not buy from this user again.",didnt work well with my iphone. Affected my ability to text even when I had it turned off and was only texting with the phones touchscreen,"Got this for someone who HATES their virtual keyboard.  For the money it was worth a try.  They really like it and are adjusting to it.  I used it for a bit and didn't think it was the most ergonomic devise...it's a balance issue, the phone is kinda top heavy with the keyboard slid out.  Can't see a way for that to be fixed without making the case way too heavy.  Nice backlight and very easy to pair.","Worked great when I first used it. Disconnects all the time and eventually stopped charging and stopped connecting, plus there's no light so you can't use it in dim or dark rooms","The one complaint I had about the iPhone was the lack of a physical keyboard for texting, but look what we have here. Case fits great, no trouble getting it on, keyboard slide out like it was build onto the phone.","Bought this because it was cheap and had just needed better keyboard function than was on the tiny screen with my adult male sized hands. It was a great item while it worked, however, It completely died after about 2 months and would no longer create a bluetooth signal.  may have let the battery die, not sure.  There are other products on the market with key patterns the better mimic the layout of a ""real"" keyboard, so that is how i replaced this one.","This works great and doesn't seem to drain my battery.  I do wish it had a right shift key and the space key took a little getting use to, but overall a great product.","Purchased this as a gift for my  wife. Was, for the most part, as described by the seller. Quality could be a bit better and as some others have said, could use a light in the keyboard. Keyboard interferes with camera unless you slide it open before taking pictures. Bottom line, nice product until the novelty wears off.","Bought this for my mom as a Christmas gift to be used with her iPhone 4, as she hates the touchscreen keyboard.  She loves this item, it works great for her and is much easier for her to use.  This will prevent you from being able to use a case, so that is the downfall, but to her it is well worth it.",I ordered this item thinking it would make texting easier.  When I received it the cover was cheap feeling plastic and the keys did not punch half the time.  Of you were ever spoiled by a quality qwerty keyboard you will be disappointed.  I returned and am waiting on my refund,wish i could use this more but the thing is like too bulky and it doesnt fit in my pocket,This keyboard and case seem to work well on the iPhone 4S.  I putchased for a friend that is used to having a regular keyboard.,"The keyboard works like it should, my only actual criticism is for individually backlit keys, and a longer battery life.",overall the quality of the keyboard is mediocre but it works just fine for its function and needs a longer battery life,this product is good in quality and price-wise however there is an issue with the keyboard.,the keyboard is very good to used. features are very nice. and it is like too bulky. did not connected to some type of phones. some times little issue for this keyboard. otherwise a good keyboard to worth of money.,
B0053O8L6I,It fits great on the phone and comes of easy. The case came with light scratches around the edges. My biggest concern is that it's only been a week and the paint is starting to come off completly.,"I love the bright vibrant color orange and was somewhat disappointed when I opened the package to see the cover looked slightly red in low light. As you twist and turn the cover, you can see a nice orange color (with red tones) and it seems to be durable. I read the reviews and heard the color was more of a burnt orange, I guess I just really wanted it to match the photo more and be more of an obnoxious safety orange. The four stars were more towards the color, I just received the case and it seems to be substantial. I will update if anything changes.","I love the case.  It's a fun color - Orange with black hue.

Pros:
*  It is rubberized but not overly rubberized so it is easy to grip
*  The case fits the Incredible 2 perfectly
*  The case snaps together and stays together
*  Great value for the money

Cons:
* None

I have had the cover for two months and so far have not had any concerns.  Would buy again.","I bought this exact case in 6 different colors. I switch about once a week, so they wear well. They snap together easily, fit snugly, and stay on. I like the texture a lot. They are matt, feel like suede and don't attract dust, fur ( I have cats) or fibers like the neoprene covers. They look great. The finish hasn't worn off or chipped like some others I've read about. I love these covers and they price is perfect. I got 6 for what others charge for one. Great deal!",I thought the color would be more of the burnt orange look rather than the bright orange I received but it will work,"This case would have been fine, but it doesn't fit the phone and doesn't snap in place. Low quality item.","This was extrememly bright, which I expected it to be a burnt orange. The day I received it the case started peeling.",Said it fit the phone I had purchased but it definitely did not fit whatsoever.  Too small for the phone.,"When I first bought my phone, Incredible 2, because I'm very clumsy, I bought the ugly looking black case for over $25 which didn't last no more than 3 months. After I took off the ugly case, I had to change my phone and this time I did not want to pay that much. so I got this one. compared to the price, I love it!!! although the color is not consistent. Like the edge of the case is.. not well painted i guess? but its not that noticeable.
color: i got the orange one and i like it. it doesn't look that bright. very similar to the picture here.

I regret so much that I had to pay $25 for the almost same case (and plus the screen protector for 5times more expensive than ones online)",was not impressed. started peeling and made accessing the phone difficult. don't waste your money. also more of a copper than orange.,"Very sharp looking.  The case is a metallic coppery looking burnt orange.  Once on, it's sometimes difficult to remove.  I put my left thumbnail into the little slot by the connector opening, and then use my right thumbnail to pull it apart at the volume control and then work it through the crack toward the headphone jack.  First shipment was not received, but seller immediately corrected it.","The case did come rather quickly by mail,  but (1) it really is a neon orange, not the burnt, warm-looking orange in the picture, and (2) the case doesn't cover all four sides of the phone-- only the back and two long sides. The top next to the power button, and bottom of the phone are completely exposed. Only a few dollars, so it'll do for now, but I'll be getting another case.",I have had it a couple weeks its paint already peeling and coming off. Doesn't snap on competely I would not recommend this product.,"This cover does not seem ""rubberized"" and has scratched very easily. The paint comes off in different spots and looked well worn after about a week. I would spend the extra money to buy a product that is more quality.","I bought this case for my brother's phone and he used it for about 3 months before the case snapped. It's pretty heavy duty in terms of what abuse it can take for a little while. Eventually, like most accessories, it just ends up breaking especially since you get what you pay for. My brother does online school so he hardly ever leaves the house and he doesn't use his phone at all much so it usually just ends up sitting in his room for days or weeks on end. That being said, this case was supposed to be a protective barrier in case he dropped it in the kitchen or on the concrete floor. What a joke. He was holding the phone tightly one day and the case snapped at the corner so it doesn't even fit his phone anymore. What a piece of junk. I mean, I didn't pay very much for it, but it attracted nasty fingerprints and broke within a couple of months of mild use. It's a little bit ridiculous that this case has already been broken. It can easily be said that I won't be wasting my time with these cheap cases anymore.",This is a low-cost phone case that has a rubber texture. The color is nice but varies and is more often burnt orange. The rubber material give a good grip but it is peeling off quite quickly. Finally it can snap off easily. ,"the phone cover tends to fit well, but can have issues snapping on properly on some phones, and can leave a couple places unprotected. it is durable, however, the paint may chip off in some places. the orange is not the same orange as seen in the description.","while there is no doubt about the quality of this product, there is a serious design flaw in it .the front side of the case doesn't cover the screen as it ought to. so much so, you can even see the edge of the screen if you observe closely. it's also loose at the sides and doesn't 'snap' onto the phone like how most cases do when the fit is perfect.",
B005441EVQ,"Nice, nice, nice. Keeps my phone running like crazy. Love it so far. Not too heavy, not too big, well, it does make your toy larger, but it worth it.
One minus - when playing (phone on side), kinda uncomfortable to play, but the rest is fine,","Was great at first. Now it doesn't seem to hold a charge as long. Not sure why, but that was the only let down.",This items takes long to charge and doesn't provide twice the battery life.  Would hope to have had one that can hold the life of the phone longer than just two hours.,"So it was great for 3 months or so but then it just stopped working. Before that I had to play with the charging cable to get it to work, which sucked. All this said, I am gonna buy a new one as I have no choice [gritts teeth]. There should be a law against phone manus making their new toys with ludicrously-inadequate power supplies....","I just love this product. It gives me double the life of my battery. Works best if you have it on after charging over night. Last 2-3 hours longer then when trying to recharge your phone. The only reason I give this a 4 is because it doesn't enable computer sync. you have to completely unhook your phone in order to transfer your files to and from your computer. Other then that this product is great. Adds bulk but I love it, gives me a much better grip on my phone. If you are interested in an extended battery go with this one if you don't mind unhooking it frm your phone to do data sync to your computer.","I purchased a PowerSkin for my HTC Sensation in October 2011.  It worked as advertised quite well, doubling my battery life and allowing me to spend a whole day without having to plug the phone in.  Unfortunately it stopped working about two months after I bought it, I think perhaps because the wires that connect the case to the phone got stressed.

I wrote to PowerSkin several times through their website to request a repair/replacement, as it is under warranty, but they have failed to respond despite my repeated inquiries.  So I would give this 4 stars for when it worked but zero stars for durability/customer service.  I will not buy another one.","Bulky, usable.
But with its size, could pack easily 1.5 to 3 times the 1500 mAH.
Easy to plug in and can charge internal battery while plug-in.
The size for 1500mAh is too little. Can easily pack 3000mAh+ battery in the that volume of space it occupies.","I am very pleased with my PowerSkin. Not only does it give me enough battery life to last the whole day (like carrying two batteries), but the rubber case is very comfortable, not too thick, and does a good job of protecting my phone. It's also extremely easy to apply and remove when you need access to the battery compartment. The only negative I can give it is that the usb connector tends to work its way out, losing contact, but I habitually push it back in with my little finger as I'm talking, so it's no big issue.","Is this a joke?  That's nearly a triple the thickness of the phone.  The i-phone version only add a little to the overall thickness but the android version makes the phone look like it's from 1990's.  I don't know what these guys were thinking but the average battery is less then 1/4"" thick, so where is the extra thickness coming from?","This case adds a second battery to my smartphone, allows me to use GPS navigation, push email, browsing the internet, listening music all day long without being out of battery.

The case material is soft and nice to touch, only thing which could have been better is the bump on the left side for the power plug, I think it could have been reduced using a smaller plug in order to be the same size as the right side, but it's not a big deal.

Another great thing is that the case is punctured for every little hole present on the HTC Sensation's back for noise cancelation mikes, so it won't block this feature such as other cases.",ehh...it makes battery last longer then it used to...but i STILL wish it would last longer! i still did recommend this product to co-workers because they have the same phone and the batteries die quick :),Buy from your local phone dealer. That way you don't have all the drama of trying to send it back to get a replacement due to it being broke right out of the box.,Alright if you have a HTC Sensation and use any amount at all you know then that the battery is at least on the verge of dying by evening or already dead. When I added this powerskin to mine it seriously added on a ton of battery life. I can go all day with no worry whatsoever now. That being said....lets move on to what sucks about it. Do not be fooled about other reviews. This case literally almost doubles the thickness of the phone and makes it VERY BULKY. A little heavy also for a phone. The thing on the side of the phone sticking out is dumb at first but you get used to it and I think it helps gripping the phone up by my ear. One more thing about this case. What it does is keep your phone topped off all day and then once this case is dead then your battery in the phone starts draining and shows it draining on the battery usage bar. WHEN this device is being topped off by the case....the case may get really warm. Overall I think it is worth....about $40. It does what it needs to do for you and what it advertises.,"If i could give ten stars I would. Exactly what I was looking for. Definitely a perfect buy!  I had been searching for a product that was thin, sleek, and protective.  The silicone cases are my favorite. They are not too rough and they aren't too smooth so the grip is just perfect.  The battery pack really did double my HTC battery life.  It was not heavy at all and I felt like I was just holding my phone without a case.  The fit of the case was really snug, also. For the price you can't go wrong. I * HIGHLY RECOMMEND* this case to anyone and everyone who has the HTC Sensation.","i recieved these in 3 days after ordering.. the quality is good and they are a great way to protect your phone! it is made of a silicon material that i find protects a lot more than anything made of plastic.
i would recommend these!",the powerskin has a long battery life. it was light and pairs with the htc sensation.,"a bulky product, that is a bit exaggerated on its size but does double the phone's battery life. the only problem is that its quality falls short after the first few months.","this case will add some bulk, but also a better grip, to your phone. the material is silicone. battery life is extended for your phone and little weight is added.",
B0055AWHP6,"I got this book, like, when it first came out. It was LITTERED with obvious typos! They would forget periods, to close off parenthesis, leave off half of a sentence, it's pathetic. I found grammar errors too, grammar errors that Koreans commonly make. This book was written by Koreans. I think they should have had a native-English speaker proofread it. To a native-English speaker like myself, those grammar mistakes are obvious. So it's obvious they didn't have one read it.

The book also has other, major flaws, but the other people who gave this book a negative review explain those quite well so I shall be silent.",This good was supposed to be in good condition..it was dirty messy old and not useable. It was not as advertised and it was worn a book that needed to be thrown out not sold.,"The book itself is okay, definitely cannot learn Korean from it, but it's good for learning some basics. The entire book is romanized so if you went to Korea the book would be useless, you definitely need to learn Hangul. I'm not sure why they don't teach the student how to write the language, that is beyond stupid, but Hangul is relatively easy to learn. Without knowing the Hangul words with ""ss"" or any other double consonants would not hold any meaning to the reader. Overall the book is sub-par, there are way better ones out there, I wouldn't buy it again.",Good afternoon. I'm happy because I have in my hands the order. It's what I expected and cause to advance knowledge of Korean by the book and the translator. Thank you very much. God bless you.,"Fans of Korean Soap Operas, that is to say, obsessive viewers of same, will love this book. Korean in phonic English which is fun and helpful.  But in addition some very, very interesting facts:  Do you know why Asians take off their shoes at the entrance to houses?
Bet you don't.  This book tells the story.  And many others.",Not very interesting--with this book you will not write in Korean-and you will not understand !!!,"Very good primer for anyone wanting to learn how to speak and understand Korean. In fact, the best guide I've been able to find so far (I studied Korean while I was stationed in Korea and bought several books and tapes, but this guide has been more useful than formal classes I attended).","Korean for dummies the ideal book for anyone starting
out,this book provides all the basics for learning
the Korean language. A good lesson book that make
studying korean, easy and fun.","This book is a must have for beginners excited to learn to speak Korean...I am a huge fan of the historical dramas, and this book helps me not to rely on the subtitles...you have to try it...thank you!","My girlfriend is korean as many of my friends, so that's why I decided to look for different ways to learn Korean.
As other languages I've learned, you start with the basics, and the korean's basic is the Hangul, or the Korean Alphabet. This books does not have any word in Hangul, so this is the first bad feature of this book.
Another basic is some grammatic, which is not one of the features of this book.
This book basically goes through several expressions for typical situations.
If you want a tool where you can learn some words and expressions, this is your book, but do not count on any methodology to understand etymologies, neither to understand korean in such way you could create your own phrases.","I love this book! It tells me things that I didn't even know that Korean people did and i""m amazed at how complex this language is!","This book really is for dummies.  I had already learned how to read Korean characters before purchasing this book and I was comfortable reading them.  This book does not have the characters, just the Korean words written in English letters.  It was so confusing.  I had to write the words down in Hangul to be able to read and pronounce the words.  Don't buy this.  It's a waste of time.  There are much better resources out there.","It's critical to learn Hangul and I'm very surprised that it isn't included in this book.  I speak some Korean and romanization is NOT a good way to learn the language.  If you buy this book, buy a book that has Hangul, learn the letters & their sounds which is very simple - less characters than the English alphabet, then translate the romanization into Hangul.  I can't stress enough that it's more important to learn to sound the words out using Hangul and do NOT rely on the romanization which is only ""ok"" at best.","you might be able to lean to speak Korean w/this, but will not be able to read it. W/o the written word, a vital part of the language is missing.  So if all you want to do is watch Korean films w/o subtitles - this may work for you.  But if you want a complete understanding of the language, it's a sad disappointment.",I got this for my husband and so far he is actually using it.,a korean translation guide book that is quite useful to understand the meaning if you like to watch korean movies without subtitles. this book does not have basic hangul but helps you to learn to speak not to read.,the book is not a good way to learn korean and has many misspellings and typos,"the book received mostly negative comments from reviewers. a common complaint is about the lack of hangul (the korean alphabet) and the use of romanized words, which do not allow readers to properly learn the language. others nevertheless found the book useful and some were even enthusiastic about it.",2 disagreements
B0055BKII8,The plastic has a coating on it that will wear off quickly but it has a nice feel to it.  It provides no protection whatsoever.  And it's already dirty after using it for only 3 days.,Fast shipment and cheap nice looking cover. The cover fits my phone so nicely and its so easy to insert it on my iphone.,"This iphone case looks great and is true to the picture. It also has a nice, satiny feeling to it.

HOWEVER, I find the case slightly loose. Not loose enough that the phone will fall out, but it is just a tiny bit longer than the phone who there is a slight shift up and down from the phone. I do not think it is bad enough to NOT take this amazing buy though.","I thought this case looked super cute online, and the reviews seemed good so I purchased it.  I was very disappointed in the result.  It is a cute case but the hole around the camera lens and flash is not big enough or something because pictures using the flash come out foggy.  Also when I tried taking the case off my iPhone 4s, it would not come off!  I ended up having to use a small flathead screwdriver to pry it off and the tool chipped my brand new phone.  Not happy. :(  I don't recommend buying this product.  Spend the money on a good case from Incase or the Apple store or something.",It took forever to get here but I love it!

The case may be cheap, but it is not worth it.","I was looking for a few pretty, unique cases for my iPhone.  Arrived quickly, in brand new condition and is a pretty cover.","It's nice to look at, but the case broke around the volume buttons the first time the phone dropped. Still I only paid $2 for it.","I love this case. It's very slick, and thing enough where it doesn't feel bulky. It scratches very easily but being that it's white you can't really see it unless you look really closely. Can't beat the price!","looks nothing like the picture, it is hideously ugly. Can not bring myself to give it as a gift as intended.",This is just as beautiful in person. Got it really fast and well worth every penny! I would have(& have)paid 3 times the priceh,"The case is absolutely adorable! It snapped onto my iPhone very easily and I've gotten tons of compliments on it! The only problem is that it offers no protection to the front cover so if you dropped it the screen would have no defense whatsoever. Also, its kind of slippery, because there's no rubber on the case at all, so it could easily slip out of your hand or something like that. However, I do think the case is gorgeous and if you pair it with a clear screen cover you will be good to go! Very reasonably priced!","I loved the design of the casae but, trust me, it does little to protect your phone. I knew this might be a problem, which is hte only reason I'm giving this two stars. I should have known. I was getting out of my car and unknowingly had my phone on my lap, so when I got out of the car the phone landed face down on the cement and the screen cracked. The phone still worked but I ended up getting the phone replaced by Apple for $150. Therefore, the $5 phone case ended up costing me $155. Be careful!!!",It's easy tu put into the iphone. The coloros are darker than the picture. The covers for the screen are good. Very nice price,a cheap product easy to fit into the cell phone and fragile that does not last long most of the time.,"the price of the case is low, however the product's quality is poor and the phone case easily gets dirty.","an iphone case that works with the newest models. designed to protect your phone, this case is easy to slip on.",2 disagreements
B0055S1U1K,"Product arrived earlier than expected, and fits its description well. The one thing I that threw me off slightly was its a baby pastel pink (almost white) glitter sparkle instead of the light bubble gum pink sparkle. However, it was a gift for a friend and she LOVES it. When it first came in I was afraid the glitter would get everywhere, however she has had it for a week now and not even a speck of glitter has rubbed off. Very Happy!","It was pretty when I first got it but turned black quickly and very dirty.  Then the material on the case would fall off glitter was everywhere,not worth it.",I ordered this case with the assumption that it would actually FIT my iPhone 4S by Verizon. Boy was I surprised. When I got it in the mail I took it out of the packaging and tried to put it on my phone and it seemed like it was made for a completely different phone. I was extremely disappointed.,i hate this case because it doesn't protect the phone at all not even a little and it feels like card board and it doesn't sit even on the phone so it is lopsided. i don't recommend this to anyone!,I liked the case a lot. It is cute and handles well. It does feel a little tight around the corners. I'd like it to fit a little better there.,This is a very pretty case.  The picture on Amazon actually reflects what it will look like (the color) in person.  It is very shimmery & I get a lot of compliments on it when I use it.  The price is great.  I would recommend this case to others.,"This is a super cute case I like it a lot especially if your a girl who loves pink, fits my iPhone 4 perfectly and it's easy to take off",It's a cute case but that's really all it has goin for it. It provides no protection for the phone and the glitter did come off rather easily.,"My daughter loved this case so much. The glitter, and sparkle of it is perfect for a girly teenager like her.",Disappointed that I will not be able to use this case. Pulled it out of wrapping and immediately had glitter all over my hands. Can't imagine after a phone conversation how much glitter would be on my face and hands!,"Don't usually use cases as I'm careful not to drop my phone, but was just looking for one as a change of scenery for my iphone. Like the description says the case only covers the back and some of the sides (Keep in mind this is Not a protective case at all). For what I payed for, didn't expect much but when I received it it was good enough. I was looking for something sparkly/glittery, and also got a lot of compliments from my friends. It gets dirty quick because the color is so light and sometimes when I slip it into my jeans pocket the blue denim rubs off onto the edges after some of the sparkles had eventually rubbed off from normal wear and tear. All in all, I was satisfied but decided to order the black sparkle case color at a later time because I liked the case, just not the dinge it got after awhile.",this pink sparles case was cheaply made it looks better in the picture than it does in person. I did not like this at all,"I ordered this case for my friend and I thought it was really cute! And it is. When she opened it she was really happy! The only thing is, is that it's scratchy and glitter falls off easily. Also the color of jeans sticks to the sides of the rubber part of the case. If you want a cheap case then I suggest this one it's cute and simple.",You get what you pay for and that is true in this situation too. I used it a few times and then threw it away because it was getting discolored and the coating was peeling off the hard plastic case. Oh we'll.,This is exactly how it was pictured and very affordable.  So far it's so good.

I was truely disappionted.,I have not yet recieved this cell phone and I e mailed them twice and they have yet to respond. Maybe I need to take further actions.,"This is not an outstanding phone by any means, but it is a good value for the money, so far. I wanted a non-Android Boost Mobile phone that would do occasional web browsing. It does what it's supposed to do. Not the most robust phone, and battery life isn't fantastic, but it's easy to use, and I haven't had any problems with it. I wouldn't recommend it for regular, hard usage, but for a backup or second phone it's just fine.","I replaced my Motorola i290 with the Theory thinking that I was getting a better phone.  Turns out that's all it's good for, theory, as far as Motorola tech people are concerned. They suck at providing sound tech advice on their own product.  You'd think they should know that there is no way to connect the Theory to a PC either with bluetooth or data cable.  It cost me over $50 to get their Motorola Tool kit, which they recommended as a solution for getting access to my contact and text messages, not to mention photos (as poor as they are!), on a PC.  Only after installing and reporting back to them that the tool does not seem to recognize Theory did they figure out that there's no way to connect Theory to a PC.  Worse still, they would not refund me even though they told me to buy it!.  Each time I called I get a different recommendation from Motorola technicians.  Needless to say, this is my last Motorola phone!  For real...",i charged the phone all night and just work half of the day! for like 3 hrs. i wish i can get my money back!,Though it is certainly cheap enough this phone has a short battery life and tinny sound. There are better Boost phones for not much more money.,"Works well as a modern phone without all the bells and whistles of an iPhone or droid phone.  You can't play music on it, but if you go online and download Opera Mini you can use your Boost Unlimited Internet on it and it functions and looks just like a regular computer.  Opera Mini is also about a thousand times faster (literally) than the browser that comes with the phone.  Great value for what you pay.  It is way more cost effective than a smart phone.","i bought this phone and i just love it, i needed a longer lasting battery, so i contacted Motorola

It has a nice fast processor, a decent amount of RAM, and supports a 32gb expansion via Micro SD.  Here's the problem.. LG and AT&T aren't going to update this phone.  It's still stuck, to this day, on Android 2.3.x.  There's no hope in sight of it ever getting upgraded beyond this point.  So unless this phone is a freebie (not-contract based) then do yourself a favor and look at a Motorola or a Samsung phone.  Do NOT under any circumstances get tied into a 2 year contract with a phone that has no support for the future.","This is by far the best smartphone that i have come across.  I think it's bettr than the HTC EVO 3D.  This phone is sturdy and doesn't feel like it's going to slip out of your hands.  The phone has tons of features, you just have to find them all.  Some you just come across by yourself and others are in the user manual.  Can't wait for the update in October.  Hopefully, this fixes some of the small minor issues.  The battery life could be better, but it could also be worse, depending on how many apps you have and apps running.  Make sure you stop off running apps when not in use.  Overall, great phone.  Good job LG!!!","Phone is big, software is unstable, and just got upgraded to gingerbread, which is an os more than 2 years old.  Although the hardware can handle it, it will never get ICS.  Not worth the money, LG does not update software.  Buy a google phone","For me, this is the best 3D phone available in the US market. Also this is one of the best glasses-free 3D screen including tv. I cannot believe my eyes to see the 3D pics and movies in this phone. And, of course, I wow-ed my friends also when I showed this phone to them. You can also take 3D pics or make 3D movie using this phone. Just remember that not all movie is ideal for 3D viewing.

Cons:
1. Battery life. When you are traveling, do not use the 3D feature. The battery's gone within an hour or two.

2. The phone still use Android 2.2 Froyo. It is kind of old OS and not as user-friendly.","I made the jump from an iPhone to the LG Thrill 4G.  My iPhone hardware was becoming unstable.  This phone is massive, but I don't care.  I love the large screen.  The phone has run flawlessly for me for two months now.

The only thing I don't like about this phone--and it is a biggy--is the 3D app button on the right hand side.  I absolutely hate it. I will be doing something important with the phone, accidentally hit the button and boom: I get kicked out of what I'm doing and into the 3d app app. This happens to me all of the time.  The button is one of the gimmicky things made for the floor sales guy so he can hit the button and instantly wow people with the 3d.  A much more useful purpose for this button would be to go straight to phone mode.","I bought this despite what i read about the battery thinking ""it cant be that bad."" It definitely is as bad as people are saying. The phone itself is nice. Screen is giant, 3d is cool, pics and video are clear, but if you use your phone for an hour, you'll be at %20 or less battery.

Poor quality although it seemed like a cool thing,"I wish there was a better design for the lens connecting to the phone besides have it use the case, also the macro and wide angle need to be separate because they are very hard to separate","This was a rare impulse buy for me.  I don't buy on a whim so I was nervous.
I rated this a 4 star because the only way to use it with my iPhone 4 was to modify the stick on ring.  The ring covers the flash if you want the ring in the middle so the lens is centered.
I ended up taking a pair of side cutters and cutting a small section out of the ring.  I stuck it on and it works great and does not impede the flash.
Just keep in mind that the flash is still blocked when you use the lens but will not be blocked without the lens.  I use my phone's flash a lot for a flashlight so it was important that it was not blocked.

Otherwise these are great little lens that can enhance your picture taking with a phone.","Is what I want, when I search and see the specifications, the product is excelent, This buy is in substitution of the older.","I really like the Camera Lens kit especially the zoom lens.

Only 3 of the 4 lenses came, and the only option provided to me is to send back and reorder and hope for better outcome, but based upon other reviews this seems a chronic problem, so next I could get fewer or damaged lenses.  The lenses look fun, but they are very cheaply made, the rings don't stick well, and you also have to turn your flash off in order get a picture that is not destroyed by the flash.  My biggest complaint is NOT having gotten all 4 lenses and being in a growing list of customers with the same complaint.

B005DMMEMM,"This is the first Virginia Henley story I have ever read and it was a disappointment. Setting aside the formatting problems, which were annoying and distracting, there was no character development, neither hero nor heroine were likable, I could find no reason why the heroine would suddenly be in love with the hero after he'd raped her on their wedding night before sailing away, or why he would be in love with her since she'd acted like a shrew from the start. There was also no building of a relationship, and the story line was fragmented and confusing. I found the writing very clichd. Dialog tags like nodded stiffly... said coldly... drawled lazily... he mocked... were all overused, stilted, writing. And a heroine with burgundy hair and violet eyes was like reading about a space alien. It was also very distracting the way the author constantly skipped between character point of views. So yes, I was very disappointed. I gave it three stars, however, because I believe she did a credible job with Queen Elizabeth.",There was a great leadup to the story and the scine was set. Tension was created between the two character who were to fall im love. Then in three paragraphs the main character falls in love. the next two pages are the sex scine and then the story is done. I was so disapointed that this story was ever published. I expect more from a book. Even a paperback or a free eBook.,"This was a really nice short story. I wish it was much longer, I was hopping for more. I recommend this book.",Virginia Henley does it again with this spellbinding story of all that is sacrificed for love.  I would highly recommend this book.,I did enjoy this maybe not as much as her other works. Felt a little cheated but it is a short story after all. Still I have been a fan of Virginia Henley for many many years and will continue to read her books!,"Love Virginia Henley! The history and romance is an excellent combo. Every time I pick up her books, I can't put them down! A great short story! How many families does Mr. Burke cook for throughout all these books? :)","I liked the premise of this, but quit reading in the middle because the sex was too graphic for me.","This is typical Virginia Henley, nothing new. She uses her usual abusive language, dominant male character and dominant female character with court intrigue. I haven't read a Virginia Henley novel in quite a while because she uses the same style that becomes boring and a turn off with her overuse of abusive language.

This novella is more of a short story that follows her usual pattern and that is rather loose. As it is short, there isn't much character or plot development. However, I think that a seasoned writer like Henley could have done a much better job. There is a better understanding of who Burgundy is, but not much is done with the hero, Nicholas. There is a disconnect between the characters that is mirrored in the plot. The reader is never really sure how they fell in love or why Burgundy decides to marry Nicholas. Henley uses two plot devices that are simply not strong: a letter and a book.

Perhaps if Henley had spent less time using her usual formula and offensive language,she might have written a better novella.","I usually either completely love or utterly deplore books by Virginia Henley.  This book was a surprise because it fell into neither category.  It is a well-written story, but nothing memorable, at least for me.  I won't be rereading this one time and time again as I have some of her other books.  I'm glad I read it, it gave me a nice escape, but I easily escaped from this world and headed into another without any regrets.","Yeah.  It was that shallow.
Who complains about free e-books?  Well, somebody needs to maintain standards.  Actually, I'm disappointed.  I've been wanting to try Henley for years--and to be fair, I do plan on reading one of her full-length novels.
But back to this literary root canal.  The central plot which I have read a hundred times before made no apologies for being regurgitated claptrap.  Nary a shred of originality to be found.  Even naming our heroine Burgundy isn't as clever as misplaced.  Speaking of which, it's a nod to the sauce, not the area in France, and for me it's arrestingly ugly.  Why not call her Malmsey, or Hippocras, or Claret?  Even Madeira would have at least been ironic.
And how could any writer get Glorianna so wrong?  Her body may have aged but her mind remained ever sharp.  It's also not likely she would have been keen on any of her ladies marrying.
All right, I'm long here.  You'll get your money's worth and a craving for boeuf bourgignonne.","Poorly written, poorly edited, a lot of written mistakes. (The word first instead of fist for example.) One dimensional characters with odd dialogue. The storyline made no sense, and even for a short story it was not worth reading. Wish I could give it zero stars. There are better free books out there.",Enjoyed reading to the last word. I wished for more. It was transported to Elizabethian era. Thank you for a wonderful read.,"The main character was not developed at all. I did not see a connection (an enotional) between the characters...

It contains love, sex and thrill. But also follows the footsteps of most romance novels, the same story line told by many many different authors just in a different setting with different characters. Overall Virginia Henley did good, plus it is free!","the book has some strong points and can be satisfying. it doesn't tread new territory but has a decent story. however, there are flaws that bring down the quality. namely, the short length of the book and lack of character development/connection that is in much of the story.",a book by virginia henley about history and romance. a quick story with graphic sex scenes but the storyline falls short.,
B005I0GXO4,The abundance of sex scenes and innuendo could have been toned down a lot and replaced with person-to-person intrigue minus the skin.,"As everyone else has said the worst part of this book was all the gratuitous sex scenes. My biggest problem was the fact that the scenes were completely unnecessary. The scenes in question weren't pornographic (i.e. not penthouse stories but cinimax at 2 in the morning) but they were non-stop the whole book. It also had one of the most ridiculous plot devices to support all the sex (ship go fast, women get horny). I liked the book as a whole, which is why its getting three stars, I just would have like it a whole lot more if the constant sex and been toned down (and I'm a guy:).",First off this is not your average SciFi book there are no space battles. The book follows the start of a carer of a young Ensign through his first ship board assignment. The characters are explained quite well in depth. The one item I was prepared for was there light speed travel. in the book it turned them all in to horny kids. But then again it was a new way of thinking about how the body handle that kind of extreme stress and the sex scenes were nice. I don't think for one bit with out them the book would have turned out so well because its a great sub point for the story. Personally I can not wait for the sequel to this book and the sex scenes were mild I have read a few other scfi books that have had sex in them and they were way out there this ne was just done right.,"Started out as a good read but as others have noted, drifted further and further into the  ill-thought out female-sex crazed plot line.  I say ill thought out because it is based upon ""high-delta v"" environment.  However, as the author points out when explaining the circumstance of engaging in EVA, unless you are accelerating or breaking, without an outside reference you can't tell if you are standing still or moving at a high velocity.  If that is the case, what is the cause of the sex nonsense?  It would have been a much, much better book without this device.",It is an interesting take on a  young mans start in the space navy where he gets lucky in many different ways on his first cruise,"ok so this book is good........

its basically a space opera meets Emanuel but with actual science written for 16 year old boys.

so yeah it ticks all the right boxes......now to win the lotto and make it into a feature film, wonder how much it would take to get Natalie Portman to star in it.","Half this book is good, the other half is rubbish!  The problem is that while the characters are quite well developed, the plot line has at its base the concept that the females on board the ship are all affected by the speed at which the ship travels...they become, in the author's words, ""horny"".  So, if you like a lot of what become quite boring sex scenes, buy this book.  If you are prepared to skip large chunks, buy this book.
Judith","This book had to be written by a 15 y/o teenager with fantasies.  He doesn't know women or men.  The writing isn't bad except he needs to get real, even though it is fantasy, this kind is embarrassing for the whole female sex and probably most of the males over 25.  The story parts are ok, except it gets worse and worse, so the real book is only short story length.  I would suggest he grow up before writing any more---or go into porn so his readers could place him in the right genre.","Fleet Academy is a highly unusual story about a space cadet's stay in a training ship.  There are no space fights against pirates or aliens on other ships.  But there is plenty of danger and opportunity for mishaps while Matt Molter, the humble protagonist in this story, conducts various exercises as directed by his superior officers.

The author pays special attention to the mechanics of moving about in a space ship, and procedures in donning space suits, going out in space, etc.  Additionally, the author creates a sexually charged atmosphere under the guise of the ship's acceleration affecting libido of the female crew.

I agree that the story went overboard on the sex scenes, and I took off a star from my rating for this specific reason.  The sex scenes aside, the story is refreshingly original, and the writer gets kudos for attempting to envision a space cadet's life aboard a training space vessel.","Some of the reviewers are certainly inhibited as seems to be the U.S. norm. Being a Scottish immigrant, I loved it!  Fast paced and very entertaining both in the story line and simple erotica. I look forward to what I hope will be the next episode in what would make a great trilogy!","I was very disappointed.  I bought the story (not really a book) direct from my Kindle.  I got the sample and it looked like a good way to spend a little time without having to think too much about it.
The sample was misleading, very misleading.  It set the stage for a Space Academy story, lead character is really proficient but insecure, etc.  That seems to be, perhaps, the only part of the story without something about grabbing breasts, erect nipples, and the rest of the fantasy world of the 12-year old.  The sex took over and covered up the story, becoming more and more impossible to believe, to the point our intrepid lead character is consumed by the amazing attraction he has for every woman on a ship, to the point that if it were even partially true on a real ship the crew would end up dead from inattention.
Someone already said this, but I'll repeat it.  If I want (bad) porn, I know where to find it.  This doesn't even qualify as bad port, just bad Juvenal fantasy.
I feel I got fooled.  Be warned.","I agree with most reviewers that the sex scenes were way overdone.  In addition, the shear number of mechanical failures experienced by the crew was unbelievable.  They couldn't do anything without a suit leak or a mechanical failure.  I was waiting for the saboteur to show up, but nobody, least of all the Captain, seemed to  notice the issue.  I can't imagine any real navy accepting such a failure rate without even commenting on it.","The Author is just using his Fllet academy story as a hook for ALL the sex scenes.  If I want Porn, i will buy it.  I resent that this book is sold as Science fiction.","This books starts out with a strong story line but quickly loses it.  The focus of the book then becomes a weak plot creating tenuous bridges between the numerous sexual encounters of the main character.  I am really disappointed!  As a writer, the author seems to have the potential to write strong compelling stories if only he can avoid the sexual drivel that populated this book.","Great Action. Good Sex. It does need to have even more detailed descriptions of the sex, such as the penetrations.","it is a book that has many sex scenes focused on the main character, making it a limited plot, but it has good writing and a quick read.",this book is an erotic story with a sci-fi setting. there is a lot of focus on the sex scenes. the space academy setting is unrealistic as no one is paying attention to flying the ship due to all of the sex being had.,flight academy is science fiction. it has sex scenes and fantasies. the book is mostly about the main character having mechanical problems.,2 disagreements

The characters are well-developed and compelling, with back-stories and a history. They have more at stake than just their attraction to one another. The love scene fits well into the plot as a whole, but it isn't the plot as a whole; it's just part of it, as it should be.

This is a wonderful little story. I wish it was longer. And I'd really like to see these two have another go at each other, and maybe resolve something of their relationship while they're at it!","I didn't realize this was a short story until it ended super quick. It was pretty good and a little heart pounding. For a short story, it definitely can hold your attention the entire time.","I didn't like this story at all. Author needs to do a bit more research before writing. Austrlian women do not currently serve in front line positions in the Army. Australia has only just announced that women could start serving in front line positions ie:special forces.
I know its a story but I hate people writing about things with out correct information.
The story by the way was horrible. The characters were not believable. Lucky it was only 21 pages or i would have not read the rest of the story.","I know these short stories are supposed to whet your appetite for more from the author, this one  didn't. In fact, I am not bothering to read any of them again.","Very fast book, well played out but not what I expected. Really wish it was longer but can understand why it was a short book.",I read this book as a friend of mine told me that she really enjoyed. Not my cup of tea. I one only one relationship at a time.,"I liked the characters  and plot but was a bit short for me.
I would liked to have had a little more body.","For people not as old fashioned as I, it could be rated four or more stars. It was a good read, I'm just a bit uncomfortable reading love making scenes. Good reading.","It was good but  I felt it dragged a little before getting to the hot sexy scene. I thought for a quick minute that there was no erotic part at all but I kept going in hopes that it would finally get to it. An tada it finally did, although very quick and short but sexy none the less.","That was like sex without an orgasm. It built up to what should have been a wonderful crescendo, but then fell flat on its face. What a disappointment.","Hot and entertaining!
Can vividly see what's happening with the written details.
Would definitely recommend to my friends to read.","Tag Team by Nicola Marsh oozes sizzlin heat and  a quickee romance combined with lots of action. Tag Team is an ideal coffee break snack that Im sure you will discover -  your coffee is still half full after you have  devoured your read.

 A short quickee that Im sure you leave you wanting more and wishing that, the special op team had taken there sweet time ** wink wink *

A sponataneous, romantic interlude, and an inferno of heat  that makes Tag Team a real scorching lockdown. Fox and Lee have a past, and in the last minutes that they have left to survive delve into a passion that has been reigninted. Swift, fast, pantee dropper Fox has moves that knocks Lee's panties off and leaves them both rethinking of whats more to come ** wink *

Tag Team is short,  and  steamy, but wafting with goodness. Ideal for that coffee break or before bedtime night cap lol.

Storyline is present, but well intergrated with romance, action and smexy scenes..",for those who enjoy a sexy romance book. it goes into details with it's sexual fantasies.,"a shorter book, but a story with many emotions and a well done and contagious plot.",this book has short story and erotic one but its easy to read since its very short.,2 disagreements
B005KDF8QI,"Easy to put on, but doesn't come off easily. The color is exactly as advertised. Great protection for a great price!",This case is not good because is missing some holes at the bottom and when I get a call I can't heard because the cover is over the little microphones.,I never got to use this cover.  It said it was for the HTC EVO 4G but it was not for mine.,This item was great at first; fit perfectly out of the package however now (a month later) it is starting to sag and lose its shape. This is still a great product I would definitely purchase more then one; maybe in different colors so that they can be switched out every so often to maintain their size/shape.,The product shipped on time and fit the phone with no problems. I had many complaints about people not able to hear or understand me. No more complaints after removing the case.,"i bought this case and i hate it. it barely even stays on the phone its so loose. If it were tighter on the phone it would be great, could be i got a bad one but i don't know.","Love the color, and the stretchiness.  I got it for a friend and she liked it.  I would purchase it again","My hubby bought this case for me. I love the color (not quite as bright as whats shown above, but still a solid & bright pink). At first I loved the case - it fit perfectly. But after time I guess it started to stretch out or something. It constantly falls off and is more annoying than helpful. My hubby bought himself the black version of this case and it's still perfectly snug! Also, since it's silicone, it gets stuck on everything (which I knew would happen) but if you like to put your phone in your pocket or tight pocket in your purse, you won't be able to get it out quickly. So, all in all - good product for a short time.","Placed order on the 12th received it on the 16th. Not as bright as shown but still cute. Soft gel, not the shiny hard gel so cotton does rub off to it. it fits the EVO design 4g well. I'm satisfied for less than a buck plus shipping which was like $1.50 I can't complain.",Wasnt the right one. :( I loved the color and material but didn't fit. Unable to use cause its not for the phone.,"great product, does it exactly what it says! This was definitely something I needed, because my phone is more on the ground than in my hand.",I like it. No problems with it. stays on for the most part. every now and then a corner will kinda slip off but its okay,"Nothing too spectacular, but fits snugly and offers decent protection. I've dropped the phone a few times with this cover and it bounces off hard surfaces. The color isn't quite as vibrant as pictured, but overall a good buy for such a low price!","I haven't read any other reviews, but I received mine in a timely fashion, and absolutely love it! It fits my htc hero perfect, the holes that open for camera and speaker are exactly where they are supposed to be and it is nice to be able to take off for cleaning of phone etc.",Honestly this case just sits in my room and collects dust. It's actually a really pale pink and very see-through. It is really ugly and fortunately I bought three other cases at the same time so I'm not out of a case. Don't buy unless you want what I described.,this phone case was very attractive and fasion with lovely colour. however the fitness of the holes in the case was make the product more less than the productive.,The product gives the satisfaction overall with the value of money and  it fits the EVO design well. Color and material is really good and attractive available in different colors.,"This is a budget silicone phone case that has a nice pink color and offers a decent protection. That case fit wells, however you may need to buy multiple items because the material stretch and the case become loose after some time.",

The calendar program on this page, Day Planner & Calendar by Magellan is my new favorite.

1. Icons for events look great in month views.
2. Every detail in other programs seems to be in this one.
3. First program with a decent Year page.
4. Offers choices of US holidays, Canada holiday, Provincial holidays, popular events, and moon phases.
5. Give good flexibility for tasks and events.  Recurring events are easy.
6. Tasks can be marked as done, so this becomes a decent ""to-do"" list program, as well.

Pressing ""c"" brings up a bold clock, which advances every minute.

It looks like Magellan read every review on all the programs mentioned above to see what people wanted.  When you first launch the program, you'll get an excellent looking month of your activities.

Superb program in every way.  Highly recommended.",So easy to use! My work schedule varies hours and where I work! So handy! Love it!!!! Thanks for such a useful tool!,Do not like the fact that only certain holidays are included.  Ease of use is okay.  Bought a different calendar planner that seems to be more flexible.,"Love this little app. It is so versitle, and so much can be entered onto it.  Love having the CLOCK also. Very flexible to  your daily needs / schedules .

In addition, I love having access to a 12 month calander on ONE page, as a great bonus.","Disappointing, very cumbersome ot use - not worth it, a waste of my hard earned money for sure.  Don't buy it.","I thought that this would be better, but I found this harder to use.  It took extra steps to record my events, especially if they were repeating events.  It was harder and took extra steps to find the events and tasks of the day.  Sure, it has more icons, but most of them were unusable for my purposes.

B005PUZO92,"I love these. I don't want to get into some audiophile debate with other folks here, but I think these are the best bluetooth headphones I have tried. The sound quality is good for both music or conference calls. The battery life has been great and I can go a week of average use (my average use) without having to recharge.
I think they are great. I'd buy again without hesitation.","Works great but, feel very cheap.  Love the ability to quickly adjust the volume\mute etc.  I have having the integrated batteries though...what happens when the batteries are no good...this unit becomes disposable.","The sound is great, the battery is pretty good too. No problem with the bluetooth comunication. In general, is a very good product BUT, the headset shape does not fit properly with the head and there is not option to set them up to make them fit. I mean, the problem is that they do not press your ears so, it feels like if you have two little speakers hanging in your head, so everyone can hear what you are listening and you can not listen good because they are far of your head.

It is unfortunate because the headset is great without that detail.",I have been using this Bluetooth since the moment I got it my home and so far its been awesome.,I mainly use these with my phone at work to listen to music but I have also used them for making calls just so I don't have to hold the phone or put it on speaker phone.  People on the other end do say it sounds a little more distant than just talking directly into the phone and I'm not entirely sure where the mic(s) are to pick up my voice but other than that they work well and the sound quality is good.  It's nice how they fold up to store them without much space and connecting it to my phone for the first time was very easy so I had no issues using them or figuring things out.  They do kind of fall off my head if I look down rather easy sometimes since they are not super snug (I have a small head though).  I like how they look and feel and have no real complaints other than what others have said about not being able to hear me as well on the other end of the line though.,Wish they didn't crap out on me because I loved these headphones. Crying shame!,"It is a phone with a very nice sound. However, constantly, a momentary mute, split-second thing, but very unpleasant occurs while listening music.","I expected this stuff get a better microphone, I work in a site with a lot of noise and didn't improvement the quality of the voice.",It is not upto the mark and it is not with for the price,"About 8 months after I bought these, the hinge on the on/off side stopped sticking into ""on"" position.  So when grabbing them off the desk to take an incoming phone call, it would unhinge, turn off, and disconnect.  By the time I realize it's happened, turn on, reconnect to the phone....missed call.  Good electronics sound quality voice quality etc, but brought down by cheap plastic construction.","I bought this as it was one of the only Bluetooth headphones with multi-point support. It started to stutter, updated the firmware. Stuttered again, reset the headphones. After a month later, it is still not reliable. I guess I will have to lower my expectations for wanting multi-point support. However, I will likely buy something better.

And while wired headphones is obviously better, I wanted wireless as I sometimes get the wire caught against something especially when walking my two dogs.","Good price. Sometimes difficult to lock on the extender position. The ear covers get a lot of stuff on them, and one of them is loose already with limited use.","Like other reviewers, I discovered it is not reliable with my Macbook Pro (sometimes it works, sometimes it sounds like a tin can and often it clicks and goes dead). It also will not connect to my HTC telephone. Surprisingly, it works wonderfully with my iPad, but sadly that wasn't my intended use for the headset.

It looks good and is comfortable. However, the black felt-like fabric picks up hair and dust and after a short time on my head it resembled my dog's bed.",I like it so much that I gave it my brother so he could enjoy the product too. Just thinking of getting another pair.,they never did work and I can't figure out how the buttons work this is supposed to be blue tooth but it was never coordinated with my system so I bought the Audio Technica quiet points and they are outstanding a lot less the price I am very dissatisfied with this job but due to the hassle of sending anything back I am just going to eat the loss it's sad because I wanted to use this for one of my clients who is disabled using the Bluetooth mechanism this set and maybe it was just mine was completely worthless,"The Bluetooth headset has some good points and some bad.  The sound quality is good. The battery life is good, however the battery is internal.  On occasion is fails to lock in the deployed position.  The fit of the headset is not the best. The covering picks up debris and always looks dirty. On occasion the headset fails to connect with a device.",These headphones will fold for easy storage. They are comfortable but do not fit very snug against the head. The ear covers are made of a black felt fabric that may pick up dirt or dust. They have a microphone but the voice quality is not great.,this bluetooth has good quality of sound and the price is cheap. it has some connectivity issues with some devices.,
B005PVXIVM,"These headphones are very nice, but unfortunately, they aren't made for small ears. They don't fit comfortably on my ear, nor do the hoops fit behind the ear like they're supposed to (at least for small-eared me). A friend of mine with larger ears tried them on and loved them--so they work for some people, just not me.",Complete garbage. Lost all bass in right ear with-in first week of light usage. They do not stay in ears for any movement or exercise more extreme of walking. Would not pay $5 for these. They are temporary/disposable earphones at best. Sent back for refund.,"work well so far, but fall off of my ears when I'm running fast on the treadmill","these are nice headphones that stay in place when running and have a sufficiently long cord without being too long. the microphone is a nice touch as well and i carried on a full conversation while jogging and everything was clear. the button is hit or miss. it hung up the phone instead of answering it and kind of acts randomly with my android phone. the sound is also a little flat, lacks bass, and they do not really get into your ear that much so it sounds like you're listening to small speakers held close to your ear instead of a true headphone. all in all, not bad for affordable and tough little earbuds.",i had a pair of these but i washed them and they didn't survive the dryer so i saw these and they looked like the ones i ruined.........but when i received these they  weren't as heavy the wires were cheap.and in about two usages the Mic just fell apart .......THEY ARE JUNK!,The fit is excellent and the security of the over the ear helps. Sound quality is good and the microphone makes it convenient to answer the phone while hiking or walking.,"Comfortable, does not tangle, has worked well for me while jogging.  I really like these.  My wife tried them out and she ended up ordering a pair for her.  I've used them for up to 3 hours at a time and they don't hurt my ear.","You get what you pay for. The plastic holding the earbud broke after a few months. Sound was okay, but there has to be better out there.","The problem these have is with the switch, when wet it malfunctions.  When I used these to work out with the sweat would be enough to cause the switch to make the MotoActiv go crazy.  The answer from Motorola was to disable the switch function on the MotoActiv, not fix the headphones. I went ahead and purchased other headphones.  I do love the MotoActiv, it is an awesome running watch; just not the headphones it came with.",With volume turned up on device still hard to hear through the headphones.  Poor quality.,"I bought these to replace the set that came with my MotoACTV.  I broke those after catching the wire on something and the headphones separated where the microphone is connected.  So, they aren't the most durable.  The sound is average for a set of gym headphones.  I can't complain about the volume even when its windy.  The clarity or bass isn't impressive though, just ok.  They fit me quite well and I like the look.  Overall, they're satisfying for the price.","Extremely Comfortable Headphones, my second pair!

Bought these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, she was looking for a new pair of headphones for working out. I own a pair and love them, she appreciates the comfort and excellent sound quality as well. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of stylish and hardy headphones.","These earbuds are for personal listening on portable devices.  They're designed for sports, so they have an around-the-ear loop and a small chest clip for added stabilization.  They also have a slider to adjust the length of separation between the ear pieces.  They come with soft plastic ear plugs, and ship with 8 extra ear plugs, just in case you lose some or wear some out.  Also included in the package is a faux leather carrying case to reduce tangles if you want to carry the earbuds in your pocket, backpack, or purse.  These earbuds are light weight and comfortable, but most importantly, their sound quality is excellent.  Music really comes alive when you're wearing these earbuds!","nice headphones, good sound quality, fit well in ear. very happy with my purchase. i would recommend this product to anyone","My first impression was that they were counterfeit because of the packaging and nowhere on the product does it say Motorola. They work okay but the cord is a little tight around the neck. They do stay in place though! All that said, I didn't expect a lot for the price.","these ear buds are light weight with an adjustable cord for comfort and a carrying case making travel easy. however, materials used are not of top quality and may cause product to malfunction or slip from ears when using.",the headphones have enabled microphone to make it possible to answer calls while doing other activities. the cords are however shorter. they come in a leather carrying case for easy pocket transportation.,It's a good headphone for the price. Microphone works fine. Volume is average. It's not the most durable. But it is very presentable. Overall it's an ok headphone.,2 disagreements

On the good side...I am curious about what the strike was all about.","I downloaded this freebie to get a taste of Shelia Roberts writing as I haven't read any of her books before. I hadn't expected most of this book to actually be a sample chapter for a cat story. I finally figured out that Kindle had opened the book in the wrong place and I found the exclusive short story which is a follow-up to On Strike for Christmas. As I hadn't read either of the books these stories were connected to I felt a little lost. The writing seemed pretty good, and I did like Ambrose being a cat person, but it wasn't what I expected. It also didn't really give me a good feel for the author's writing. Maybe I'll have to check out one of her books from the library.","This was a cute follow up to On Strike for Christmas -- short & sweet, but gave the reader (me) insight to what happened next!!","While this is a cute little story - it is also just an excerpt out of a book I had already purchased.

Theres not much to say these earphones are exactly what I wanted.they have great crisp sound with descent bass all with wirelesss convenience. The only thing I would suggest to Novero is adding some foam ear pieces. I perfer the foam ear pieces, they would stay more firmly in the ear. I say this from experience I took the earpieces off my much loved JVC Marshmallows which just happen to fit these perfectly and do secure them much better in your ear. They also have superior noise cancellation.","I really like this product for many reasons, however I was disappointed by the volume.  It does not quite generate enough decibels to fully enjoy music.

They are a great design and fit though for normal use. My only criticism is you can never tell if they're shut off and if they aren't batteris go quickly.

I called Amazon to simply exchange item for Item that works. I was told by Amazon that they can not exchange but only return item because they shipped it but because it is sold by a different party that is all they can do, advising me to buy it again and wait for refund to hit my card..This to me is unacceptable process I only had the item two days and it doesn't work now I have to jump through all these hopes to get an Item that works...and now the price has jumped from $79.99 up to $108.99...an I only want a replacement...I will report Amazon to the better business bureau and never order from them again they have satisfied there company because they have my money but there is nothing they can do for the customer.....!!!!!!!!","good for the gym IF you don't sweat. other than that great for everything else. I don't regret the purchase, but will look into a better more practical set.","I bought these as a replacement for a lost pair of the Sony's .  The design is good and I really wanted a pair that could work with the standard micro usb charger and pair with two devices.

While indeed the Noveros do these things the overall build quality is terrible.  Cheap labels fall off the earbuds so you lose track of which ear is which, the battery cover is very flimsy etc and the quality of the connection is very poor.

Maybe in the future they will fix some of this....but at least for now these are best avoided.  I sent mine back for a refund.","I didn't expect these to compare to the Bose (wired) IE2s headphones I normally use but after using those for a long time, the Rockaway Headset makes my music sound like it's on an AM radio with an old shallow speaker.  There's hardly any bass and the buds do not sit well no matter what size I use - they fall out often - maybe because of how far the ends stick out.  I've used the Rockaways in the office paired to my laptop about 3ft away and on my iPhone as well with the same sound results.  I'll just get an extension cable for my Bose instead of continuing with these.","They have great battery life.

I really wish they were ear buds and not in-ear.  They don't stay in my ears and even with the smallest ends hurt my ears after a couple hours of listening. But the audio is extremely clear and the max volume is nice and loud.

They do sufficiently drown out background noise so they work great in loud environments I just wish they were more comfortable for me.","I thought design was very nice.  They fit well and I liked  the flat connecting wire.  My problem was the music quality was just not there and I went back to my wireless head phones, less money and better sound.","Overall i am proud of my new bluetooth headset, although there is room for improvements:
1st -- improve the max volume of the speakers, volumne does not get loud enough.
2nd -- the clip and the plastic cover that covers the charging port both broke.

The right ear bud as all but stopped working. I can only hear a faint level of sound. I will be contacting novero to see what they can do. The left side remains unaffected.

Eventually after months got a replacement but it was a huge hassle and took lots of follow up contacting. Don't have much faith in the replacement...

I was right to worry about the replacement. It also quit working properly on the switch side. It has a very very low volume on the one side even at full volume! With all the hassle to get the first one replaced I don't think I'll bother with the second set.
very expensive garbage!","i got this headset today, i am so excited. but was disappointed when i cant swith it on at all. at first i thought is because the batt is low so i plug in the cable provided and try to charge it. when i plug the cable to the device, the led light shows blue led (fully charged) instead of red led (charging). i tried to charged for more than 12 hrs althought the led was showing blue light. after more than 12hrs i try to switch it on and it won't switch on. anyone have the same problem too? pls share... thanks

days later ...

i got a reply from quantum wireless saying that i can ship the headset back to them.
i am so disappointed, this is my first time ordering from them and i got a defective set. i paid the headset for (headset $80 plus + shipping $50 plus = total $130+) and now i got to ship back ($60) due to faulty set they send me. now they are telling me that most likely i will get a refund back for only the item i order. they don't cover the shipping fees. really sad and disappointed.","These are nice but I have two issues.

I was not going to compare them with my Bose headphones for the sound quality, but they are good for being as small as they are and bluetooth.

It works well even though he is pretty picky when it comes to electronics.,"I loved the design and bought a pair despite the low ratings. The Rockway will just not stay in your ears. Forget about walking around in it, I stayed motionless and it fell out under 10 seconds. Coupled with a very average sound quality I just had to return this pair.

It looks great but just doesn't perform in the real world. Get an other brand that understands ergonomics.","I was so excited at first when i saw this for the first time. There were no reviews for the product but i had been waiting years for wireless bluetooth earbuds that had volume controls. I bought two pairs. when they arrived one of the pairs was broken. The second pair worked for maybe 4 days and then stopped working. I believe they are not made very well.

The cord is two long which makes them heavy, it only takes a little bump for it to fall out of your ear, which includes changing the volume. In my opinion that defeates the purpose.. The cord comes out of the earbuds sideways in my opinion which makes it uncomfortable because it rubs agains your ears.

If they could fix the issue with them breaking i could have lived with the other issues long enough for a better pair to come out.

The company itself is not helpful and rejected my negative review of there product. They also would not accept my return of the product. They would not exchange it either or fix them.",The worse Bluetooth I have ever had. the sound quality is so poor. The worse part of this product is there is a lag about 2 seconds that mean you can't enjoy the movie or game with this product.,"Had these shipped to a relative in the USA and then brought to us in Canada, which seems to be they only way to get many items from Amazon.

B0061N848A,"An interesting concept for the story, but it wasn't executed well.  I didn't realize this wasn't a full length book when I purchased it, so I was surprised by the lack of details and nuance in the stories execution.  While I enjoyed the characters, they weren't given time to develop fully so it was hard to emotionally connect to them.",I downloaded this book because it was free for the kindle and I'm glad I didn't waste any money on it! It's rushed and just overall not very good.,"It's always a joy to read a Delilah Marvelle novel, and this novella is no exception. Lady Augustine Jane Ascott and the Duke of Wentworth are characters you can't help falling in love with. I rooted for their happy-ever-after from the very first page. A must read.","I loved this book.  A great historical romance is hard to find these days.  I'm all about the story, and Marvelle is a gifted storyteller. This is a keeper for me.","The story was good, but it was short and unresolved at the end. I'm undecided as to whether or not to continue the series, but it was written well enough and kept my attention.","I've read the prequel and listened to all the books in the series.  The storylines are very intriguing and tearful in places.  To round off the stories is a good bit of humor.  Although these could most likely be read or listened to as stand alone I would suggest the reader start with the prequel, which can only be read.  There are also the deleted chapters to the prequel on the authors website.
If you listen to the series the only downfall is the switch in narrators.

This is a great series.","First of all, I did not pay for this book. It was borrowed through the local library ebook system..a fact for which I am incredibly grateful because if I had paid for this mess of a book, I'd be hopping pissed. Historical inaccuracies abound, pulling me out of what was a great idea but very poorly executed. Dialogue is, as one reviewer puts it stilted and just all around terrible. I get this is a prequel but the writer has to resort to telling us Augustine and Irving are in love. She does not show us; instead we have to bloody take her word for it. This kind of shoddy writing makes me angry as I want to be immersed in their story and yet I feel like a dispassionate bystander. Nope, sorry. I really can not care about these characters. The writing is certainly competent but that's about the only thing this book has going for it. Save your time and money. Read something.","Even though this novella takes place 20-some odd years before the first book in the Rumor series, Forever and a Day, I would suggest reading Forever and a Day first. That way, you are not spoiling some of the story from Forever and a Day. Plus, I personally enjoyed seeing Leonard first as an older gentleman in the role of Roderick's father, and then in the novella as his younger self finding love for the second time.

Leonard, the Duke of Wentworth, has set his eyes on Lady Augustine. He is ready for marriage again after seven years of mourning his first wife. Lady Augustine has different plans though. She is consumed by a family tragedy and does not think she could make any man happy until she gets some answers.

I found this to be a very bittersweet novella. It was also pretty humorous. Leonard's dialogue, especially, was very amusing. I'm now very much invested in finding out what happened to Nathaniel. Looks like I will have to wait until July when Forever a Lady is published to learn more.","This was just a little prequel but it was so rushed. Lady Ascott wants a husband, a real one that won't lie, cheat, steal and everything. She wants someone she can trust that won't hurt her and will love her, truly love her. The Duke of Wentworth comes along boasting about his love for her when they hardly know one another. It roams a bit around their get together but then most of the story is about the mysterious loss of her brother.","This is not for those looking for a rich reading experience.  The plot is sketchy and there is very little character development.  I wasn't sure where the author was taking me even when I got to the end.  Thankfully, the book is short.  I don't recommend this one.","I totally agree with the other one star comments. No story, no real insight to the characters, lousy dialogues.
The only positivity that it was for free - so for me it was ""only"" a waste of time..

It's such a pity. Not only did I leave a negative review, but the author will never have a chance with me again.",What the@#;@. It was like pulling teeth getting into this story then you get interested in it and its suddenly over.,"The rumor series by Delilah Marvelle

1. Forever mine: one of the worst prequels I have had the misfortune to read. It starts OK and then abruptly jumps ahead and stops without giving us a gratifying conclusion of the love story.

I have had a great time reading the rest of the series, except for the ending of book ""2.""

There wasn't really a romance here as much as a set-up for her next story--and, even then, it felt incomplete and stilted. The author mentions there are other chapters on her site, but I just didn't love the characters enough to put more effort into them.  I think I set myself up to be disappointed by assuming this would feel like a completed story line--and teasers just never do.","So, I'm usually not one for the ""shorties.""

I was just a little scared in the beginning but otherwise good book.,"Cheating Housewifes had it's monents, but not quite there.  Stories could have had a little more to them.

Lord, please bless me with a return of the two and a half minutes I spent on this...","It is very sweet that this caring housewife is willing to take multiple loads of ""black baby batter"" deep on multiple occasions to keep her poor husband from losing his place. I like Juliette's transition from desperate, reluctant participant to wanton, can't-get-enough slut over the course of this story. And now her husband's coming home and the poor sap will never know another man's tools have been in his shed...what a whore!","I found the descriptions of the sex scenes to be ok, but what really killed it was the twist happy ending. It's definitely not what I got this for. I'll admit that the sex scenes were hot, and that was the only saving grace in the face of poor characterization and spontaneous changes in motivation. Other than that, I'm happy I managed to get this for free because otherwise I'd be infuriated at the fact that I actually spent money on this. If I need a short read and quick shameless fap, I might crack it open, if my memory of it doesn't urge me to delete it.","I gave this book 4 stars because I thought it was better written than most books of this type.  A cheating housewife having unprotected sex with a man from a different race to pay her rent.  At first she is dressing sexily to influence her landlord, then is shocked when his agent insists she have sex with him.  Then it is daily sex, and finally the rent has nothing to do with it.

B0064GYRFI,"For the price of the product, it definitely fulfills my expectations. Fits the iPhone 4s like a glove and looks nice. My only complaint is that similar to other white or grey cases, it dirties quicker than other colors. Overall, Chivel makes a quality product.","Arrived very quickly, broke about a month into having it but still useable. For the price, what can you expect",It is cheap. When I opened it it was already scratched on the buttons. Yesterday the gray lining started to seperated from the plastic casing-basically it is already falling apart.,"This case is very stylish and I like it a lot. However, I don't see it providing a lot of protection if you drop the phone. It's just for looks, that's for sure. But I'm not very hard on my phones like some people so, it works for me. The rubber part did start to shed (best word I can think of to describe what it is doing) after a period of time, but I got the case for so cheap, I'm not too upset about it. It just gives me an excuse to get it in a different color.",Its not bad for the amount you pay. The only problem i had was the white rubber corners become discolored rather quickly. BUT its way cheaper than  buying the actual apple bumper,"This particular bumper works great on my iPhone 4S.  The buttons all have the metal, aluminum look and feel to them just as the Apple version does.  However, from what I can see Chivel-made bumpers should have the name on the bumper itself.  This does not.  Of course this does not take away from the utility of the bumper itself, it does however, give users the notion that they are indeed receiving a Chivel product.

4 stars only because the bumper does not seem like a real Chivel product.  Other than that, it is a great accessory.","If you're like me, you're considering buying this bumper because of it's low price and appearance.

Both of those factors work in it's favor.  It looks good out of the box, matches my white iPhone well, and was waaay less than the overpriced bumpers Apple sells.

I also liked how the rubbery part of the surround added a bit of grip to my phone.  The stock iPhone 4/4S is way to slippery in my hands, which makes me nervous.

All the buttons line up well and work fine.  The rubber around the headphone jack doesn't work well with all 3.5 mm connectors, but I can live with that.

Unfortunately, this bumper just hasn't held up well over time.  After about 2 months, the rubber surround material started separating from hard plastic core of the bumper.  Additionally, the rubbery portion of the surround attracts grime like a magnet, and it seems hard to clean.

So, definitely OK given the low price, but you also get what you pay for.",I like idea of the cover but the top bottom has already broke off. Only had it for a month,It works fine to protect my iphone i recomand it its a great product Good goood good good .. .,"Basically this case is only so-so. It's a nice bumper, but within about 2 weeks it had cracked and the silicone began to separate from the plastic frame. I'm not hard on my phone at all, and I only got about 4 weeks out of this bumper case. It also doesn't have the proper cut-out on the bottom, so you have to actually remove the bumper to charge the phone or plug it into an accessory (which probably contributed to the cracking of the plastic). My advice---spend an extra $10 for a case that will last.","I've used all-white bumper cases in the past, and hated that after just a few weeks the silicone bumper edge would turn yellow from handling. No amount of cleaning would remove the yellow. I hoped that the gray edge on this case would perform better, but sadly, it didn't. Within a week it was a dingy yellow-gray and again, would not come clean. The rigid white plastic sides were still pristine. The case did fit my iPhone 4S perfectly and all buttons worked well.

I replaced it over a month ago with the LE White and Green Premium Bumper case. The new bumper looks and fits the same, but the green silicone is still bright and pretty, with no yellowing at all. I have not had to clean it yet. I paid $1.88 for the LE vs $6.99 for this one. I recommend the LE.",Bumper case looks nice but it breaks easy. I only had it for approximately 10 days and the power button came off. So there goes my bumper case.,"I picked this case up after reading that it actually fits the 4S model; the prior ""bumper-style"" case I ordered was from a different company and required some filing for the mute toggle to fit properly and the volume buttons never lined up quite right.  I'm happy to say that this bumper case is a perfect fit for the 4S.  The volume buttons feel great and the mute toggle works without any modifications needed.",This one is more than adequate. It is a little rough with some mild parting lines but after I ran a nail file across it they were long gone.  Fits a little more snug than the Apple Bumper and that's a good thing.,"This bumper fits my AT&T iPhone 4s perfectly.  The buttons work well, and look good.  The bumper also fits over my front and rear protector films.  This is a high quality product.

B006DI8FIW,"I was hoping to receive an all-red bumper, but the outer rubber was a bit lighter than the inner red. It looked more of a light red/dark pink compared to the inner ""firetruck"" red. Thankfully the seller was understanding and sent me an all-black one instead.",This case appears to be red on the picture and the title but when you relieve the bumper it is almost hot pink. Also the buttons on the volume and the lock fell off within the first day.....,The product is awesome fits my iPhone 4 snug. Not loose at all. All the buttons on the bumper work. Not an issue charging it either.,My last bumper came from Apple and lasted well over a year.  This one is falling apart after only a month.

Made kind of cheaply and fits a little tight. But works,The lock button came off the bumper. I wasn't satisfied with it because it broke and I didn't have it for long.,"Looks good, fits good, but doesn't last very long. Separates where it wraps around front and back of phone.

Good product. Recommended. Would buy again. Very happy.","I didn't like this bumper.  It didn't fit right, and thus it wrinkled and ruined my skinit sticker.

I just didn't think it was as good as an apple branded or even a good knockoff.","I like the way it look in my phone and it looks like the material is better than the one i use to to buy, let's see how long it's going to last.","The case appears to be red in the photo but is more hot pink, fits the phone well, doesn't make charging difficult, works well for its price, but it shouldn't last long.",The color of the product is different from the image but overall it is of good quality and works well,This is a cover for iPhone 5s that is pink in color. The style of the cover is a bumper which only covers the sides of the phone.,
B006G3C8SW,This was a horrible case when I got it I put it on and it worked great just until about 2 days. Than the whole thing fell apart I want my money back or another FEW sent to me!!,I order this three months ago and never got my phone case. The company isn't wanting to work with me and it was a Christmas gift.,The bumper is better than a thick phone cover however the blue is more of a purple then blue. I would recommend this to anyone.,"my son used it for a short of time and it tore-won't use it now; although it wasn't pricey, it wasn't quality","For all gator fans out there, this is the perfect case for you. Great protection with a slim look and that no case feel",i definitely recommended to other people. I think the price is absolutely no one can beat it but the quality is good too.,I just recived this product about a week ago. Although I ordered a blue and orange case i recived a case which is very much purple and orange. But it is still a nice case I have recieve many compliments on it.,the colors were great because it represented my team but the durability of the product itself wasn't too good. it already started falling apart. i would order another one but it's not worth the time and delievery. it was fun while it lasted,"Its more of a purple color and def not blue at all.  Other than that its a good bumper case. As good as any i have used. They are more like disposable ones since really they don't last more than about 5 months or so. The rubber starts becoming stretched out, but at the price i usually just buy a couple at once.","It was really cheap but the color was not real. I thought it was the home color as NY Knicks, but it was actually purple and orange. If you don't really care about that, then it is a good case.","I bought this for fun.

Quality: As good as a Bumper can be

Seller: Great",i haven't recieved this case yet. I hope to get it soon and then i can put a better review...,"It feels cheap, with some unfinished, sharp seams in the plastic, but considering the price, it is a good deal.",Well im not the type of guy to write reviews on anything nor do I feel as though what most people write are accurate but in this case it is. The photo makes the case appear to be a nice bright shinny orange and a dark glossy blue however in my case (no pun intended lol) it has a dull orange band and a vilot/pruple rubber edge. Knowing this I probially would have pasted on the case but what do you get for 2$? Also the sleep button is very sloppy and has to be in the correct postion to work or else another oart hold it down and it constantly tries to power down the iphone. Hope this helps,"Its a very cute and likable case, I get many compliments. The only problem is its not much protection but it is good besides that.",this phone case is cheap at only two dollars but tends not to last long. the blue in the color scheme sometimes appears more purple.,"the price is reasonable, and the quality is good. it is better than disposable ones. the case could offer more protection and durability.","despite possessing a fun color combination, the product is a phone case that fails to usefully protect the phone or maintain its own condition. shortly after use, many users found their cases had accrued significant damage.",

It was short and sweet. Love sylvia day books. Can't wait to read more.,"I don't know if I didn't get the whole download of this ""short story"" but I was confused about the length of what I purchased.  I don't even know if you could consider it a book....it is more like a first chapter of a really trashy beginning.  I would not purchase again and would not recommend it to a friend.  I didn't notice that I had an option for 1/4 star, so I had to give it a one star.  I should have known better than to buy what was considered an erotic novel.......not even close.",jump in for a great quickly!  I loved it. A fun read for a lazy weekend. All Sylvia Day novels rock.,"I was expecting a novel, but soon realized I was reading two different stories. They were both very good. The first one was the best. I wish it had been longer.

I have found no aid so great as that of making the mind follow the body movements.  The motion of an awning  mind are not only very jerky and wasteful but they are exceedingly quick.  Such a mind vibrates with the speed again destructiveness of lightning, and the owner simply cannot compel it to be absolute be quiet.  But he can direct as well as to a very great extent.

I use it in my office where I have very poor reception and usually only 3G.  I placed the antenna right next to my office window and now I always get 4G reception.

As long as I place the mifi in an area where it won't get bumped, the plug stays connected and the reception is very good.",I really did not expect much from this antenna but it pleasantly has surprised me it definately does improve my reception with my verizon MIFI 4510L hot spot.,"This product is the top of the line .

B006UCVJKM,Not a bad read at all just expected the ending to have more to it.  Overall I enjoyed the book.,"Although i really enjoyed this book , I would love to see a story like this written by Stephen King who is a little better at writting this kind of story.",this is an interesting story.everyone can learn something from this book.the firdt time i went yo montauk i knew i have end up writing about it.,"Wow! I was completely engrossed in the psychological twists throughout this book. This writer pleasantly hands you these characters that immediately blow your mind. I love the pathological style that Vin Packer uses to describe these psychopaths so much that I bought another of his books, also amazing.","Well, not much of a page turner, this one. It certainly isn't a bad book, it's well written and slightly interesting. It just doesn't really go any where. There's no climax, no real denouement, it just sort of....is. And it certainly isn't ""revealing"" into the ""psyche"" of youth.

Strange. That's the feeling I'm left with. Just, strange.",i am VERY glad i happened upon this.  every character was enjoyable and relateable. i 'got' what everyone was experiencing and thoroughly enjoyed the read. the way in which the troubled parties asked for help - or demonstrated a need - was extremely very well written. the device for weaving everything together and use of 'the media' was good. purchase this now.,"Lovee the book except how it ended.  It had several stories that seemed separate but had the same theme, how mothers screw up their kids!  Pretty good!","How is this book supposed to make sense? Disjointed and jumps around,not worth the hour it takes to read it.",I greatly enjoyed this book!! It was a quick read (although I tend to go through at least a book a day no matter what length)and I really liked the style of writing. I just didn't want to put it down! I have since read a couple more of this authors books and liked them just as well....keep me interested the whole time!,This is about 3 young people and how the forces that surround them mold them into the warped personalities they become.  The ensuing crimes they commit flow from their fractures psyches.  To me this read almost like an abnormal psych textbook.,"I read a lot of books and try to read new authors.  This book was ok to read once but not one I would consider reading again.  It was somewhat like reading a news report and didn't really compel me.  I wasn't pulled into the stories nor did I feel much for the characters.  Just not ""exciting"" enough.  I did read the entire book as I always do but won't be reading again.","This book really takes you into the mind of psycho.  They don't explain anything clinically they just give you a visitors pass into the cold blooded.  A short book, but a very chilling experience. We all know that they are out there, but to see inside them is something that most of us never do. If you don't want the small hairs on the back of your neck to stand up, don't read it.  If you like to be spooked, pick it up today....","A youngster takes a gun to school and kills some of his fellow students; a
young man paints his face, goes to the movies and randomly kills others
in the theater. We try to pin down the reason. Too easy to get guns? Too
non-chalant about the odd ones among us? Or is it ""the times""? Today's problems aren't really new as Packer demonstrates in a novel written a half century
ago about ""the times.""  The three lead characters in The Twisted Ones are
from the fifties. They wil be familiar. They will be terrifying. But Packer
did not view them as ""twisted"" nor was the title one Packer approved of. This
wasn't a story of three crazy kids who one day went around the bend, but more
a look at three youngsters unrelated, unknown to each other, not that different
from any young people on the outside...But inside...inside...that's where
it starts. VP","Those of us who had our childhood in the fifties know that it was really  no Leave It To Beaver life.  The small town life in this small book conceals so much festering dysfunction; what's really sad here is that in each case of these psycho kids, there is so much mis-understanding.  Each character has a persona perceived by others, but inside, they are totally something else.  (But isn't that the way it is with all of us?)  It took me a few pages to get my bearings in this book; I believe it's a vintage one from the 1950's, and the writing style reflects this.  Once I got into the story, I had to keep reading to find out the connection between the characters.  My conclusions: Life is  all happenstance.","This book is short, the story is simple, and the characters are predictable... but it is a ""fun"" read. Can't beat the price (at the time I purchased it anyway) and you can't expect too much from a free book.","this book is a psychological thriller, featuring young characters, with lots of twists and turns throughout the book","the psychological side of the story is really interesting and it has, in general, a pretty good plot.",The book by Vin Parker is a captivating read with twists and turns that leave you engrossed in it. Representing a storyline in the 50s it captures a mundane experience and tells about 3 young boys and their wild escapades. It is an interesting read for a free book despite having an all the subtle ending and disjointing personas it captures and captivates.,
B006VYMHT6,I buy a new inexpensive one every couple of months and this one held up the best in my 12 year old's hands,"It was just as I had expected, and it came pretty fast. I would order it again. It was cheap and did exactly what I needed it to do.",The design is really bad. the plastic is inside and the rubber is outside which is really bad way of protecting the edges and glass of a smart phone. And I am saying so is because it did not protect my Razer from breaking. when in fell. Its really good on price but not worth it as the replacement digitizer would cost $180-$200. So its better to buy someting that would protect the Razer really well. Will not recommend to others.,"Ok, this is a look alike and similar protection to the otterbox series my husband uses and loves.  I don't use belt clips so this option was better for me, the little stand is helpful at times too.  The plastic case itself is a little fragile in removal from phone and the stand is not a sturdy plastic either.  there is no screen cover or protection of any kind included with this case, so additional purchase of that is required.
for the price though, you cant get better and weve purchased a 2 and intend on getting a few more in various colors.  And as always we keep a few screen protectors on hand just to ensure the phones are as protected as possible, the gorilla glass is only so safe if dropped and scuffed...",Don't think this is going to make your phone indestructible. It adds a lot of bulk to an already big phone.  I bought it for my son and even with the case on it he managed to bend the phone enough to break the screen and of course has no idea how it happened.  If you don't mind the bulk and drop your phone often you will probably like it and it does add quite a bit of protection.,This is absolutely the worst case ever!!! It does not fit the XT912 as it states. I cannot even get the hard plastic inner case to lock together on my phone. I left the hard case in 2 pieces and just applied the rubber case over it. Still terrible. The power and volume buttons cannot be used while the rubber case is on. Don't buy this one. I would look for a better case.,I have an XT912 however this case is not made for the XT912 despite what the description and packaging says.  Don't waste you money.,this case has worked fine for my husband who is a plumber and in the field all day.  Plus the kickstand allows him to play is games on the phone also.  :),"case is set up nice gives the phone some girth to hang onto, but noticed after having it its hard to use the side power and volume buttons. It has the bumps to use, but doesnt always work. so 3 stars for inconvenient.","It worked, it looked cool, but then the buttons wouldnt work... when I tried taking it off the tabs snapped. So it will work and look great for a while but the rubber for the buttons is to flimsy and they stop working.","Exactly What I Wanted!!

Nice price and protects the phone though.",its a pretty good fake otterbox. the only thing is the stand broke but that took a while before it happened,This is okay.  much bigger in person when you get it on the phone (which is already big to begin with)  But not terrible.,"This case is fantastic quality.  It is a hard case for superior protection, but has an additional silicone layer covers the hard case to protect the case and the phone from hard impact.  The silicone is thickest on the corners where it would most likely hit if dropped.  You can't beet the quality and price of this.  I'd take this over Otterbox any day!  It protects your phone better and is way cheaper!",the customers were not satisfied witht the product. it was not build with good quality and not much protection for the smart phone.,"Overall the reviews are mixed with most people enjoying the case for what it is. Most comment about the protection the case provides as being good, but the quality being cheaper than name brand counterparts.","The case has a nice quality and gives good protection to the phone, however it doesn't fit every phone even though the description says so. The sides of it are too thick making it hard to click the volume buttons.",
B006W0PPAM,"I wanted a case that didn't make my phone 3x bigger and heavier, and this case was a good fit.

However, being said it turned out to be very flimsy and an obviously very cheap product. The case is also hard to take apart when you're trying to take it off the phone. A month after having it, I dropped my phone on the carpet and it cracked.

Useful for the time being, but won't last you very long.","Cheap plastic, doubt it's rubber.  Doesn't even hold together.  It feels really week.  Really don't know why I need to say more...",This fits snug and makes your phone look original and fancy!!! I would definitely reccommned it to anybody that wants a fancy original look for their phone.,"The case is wonderful, it comes ship in the mail as promised. i just cant stand the fact if something sticks on it its hard to get off, or it will not come off at all.

No clue what will happen if I drop the phone.,havent dropped my phone so I'm not sure about protection. Snaps on easily. Of course it's white so its gotten some color arounnd the edge from just kinda dirt and stuff in my purse. Hopefully it'll come off when rinsing the case with soap and water.,I didn't like that it was a two-piece case and came apart if my phone did fall on the floor,Protects my phone well. I have dropped my phone many times and it saved it each time. Snapped back together each time too. I also ate s*** when I tripped and landed with my phone in my hand. Case got scratched but phone did not.,Nowhere near durable. I dropped it from my desk one time (never dropped before)and it broke. Also turns blue from your jeans i like my white phone case to stay white not to turn blue.,I give it a one star because its a two piece unit that snaps in. If you drop it splits up due to hard case. It does not have rubber feel or look. HARD PLASTIC. Hate it.,I paid a penny for this case and I guess you get what u pay for. I would not buy this case again.,"Just got the case, it came with a weird layer of dust all over it and some sticky spots on the inner back side. I gave it a good wash and tried it out on the phone. Seemed alright at first, beside the fact that the seems don't really fit together and there was cheap plastic that needed to be peeled off the sides. I decided I would just toss it on the carpet, since that couldn't possibly do any damage to the case or the phone... The case immediately popped open on one side. I can't imagine what would happen if it had taken a harder hit from an actual drop. Will be sending it back tomorrow. Not even worth the few bucks unless you feel like duct taping the seems together.","Even with the black HTC Vivid, the case still looks really sweet. Power and volume keys are left exposed, which for me is a real good thing because you don't have to push to hard like you may have to with other cases. I did take off one star because the seams where the two parts of the case meet could be better, but it still gets the job done for sure.","I know it's hard to believe a plain white cover is cute, but it's really stylish and makes the phone look really nice. My battery would always pop out of my phone when dropped and since I purchased this, it doesn't happen anymore. I've had it a couple of months and it is getting a little dirty on the edges, but it is a white cover so that was expected.",Also the texture of the case causes it to get dirty very easily. Even turn bluish from your blue jeans.,"feels very bulky, with more protection on back the in the front. there should have some lip on the front instead of the back to protect the screen.","According to the reviews, the case gets easily dirty because of the texture of the case, but the case fits perfectly to mobiles and it was hard plastic..","This case is not extremely durable, long-lasting, or particularly easy to use, but if you're more interested in a low-cost, fancy look than hardcore protection, it might be the way to go.",

This is more like the home version where you only have two rolls.,I love this game so much. I love playing it on my computer all of the time. I think everyone should play it.,"This is an ok game, although the other Farkle games I have played have allowed straights.  Also it is  a little like Zilch and a little like Yahtzee.  There is a lot of finger work on the older kindles, which I have and I suspect that it would be much easier on the touch or the fire.

The one on Kindle is great, I love it..",I love this game but i wish it had the same rules as regular Farkle. But it's still a good game.,"This is a good interprettion of a dice game which has many names such as Zilch, You're Out! and others. The object is to make the scoring combos in a dice roll.  Unlike Yahatzzy, the winning combos aren't based on poker per se but are seemingly arbitrary rules of this game.  Each variation of matching or sequencing numbers gives points (often lots of them!) and the goal is to reach the winning total before your opponent.  Easy to learn, yes.  Addictive yes, yes!  You'll likely find yourself saying ""just one more round and I know I can do better!"".  The only downer (and why 4 not 5 stars) is that it's sometimes a bit clumbsy to maneuver with the square controller.  But that's not a severe drawback and if you like dice games, I suggest giving it a try.","This verson of farkle is awful. Truly awful. The game play is clumsy, the few options available are laughable, and yet the interface is complicated. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",This version of the game is very simplistic.......stick with the real deal.  There are so few options that the game is not challenging at all.,The rules are established and not recognizable by any Farkel I have played.  It is a very limiting game.  Is there a way to delete it?,"The game of Farkle the way I learned to play is very different. Each player gets three rolls. A roll of 4 of any number is worth 1,ooo points.","It took me a while to catch on, but if you keep playing you soon will see what it means to farkle.  Still having a good time playing, especially if I'm waiting in the car for someone.  Not at all boring.","I have played Farkle on the net for years, but this version is clumsy to play and not very versatile on a simple Kindle.  I will continue to look for a friendlier download.",In the regular dice game you can choose to shake the dice.  In the regular game you can shake the dice until you lose or until you stop.  This came doesn't give you a choice.,"Grew up playing this with my mom, then playing this with my cousins and using pennies, nickles, dimes and quarters to make it a gambling game.  Many fun nights when I was young and in my 20s.","a simple and easy game to play overall, but a little different from the other, older version.",the electronic version of the frakle game is quite interesting for the beginners and will be a good time pass but for the advanced players some might feel bored.,"The Kindle version of the Farkle game looks nothing like the original. Indeed, the rules are different and playing on the Kindle is not ideal. However, it is still fun to pass the time. ",

But honestly it deals more with the plants and herbs found in europe.  It is not as illistrated as i had hoped it would be. I was looking for something for the beginner herbalist and this is certainly not it. For instance if you don't know what Mallows is you will not learn it here. It has a very nice description of the flower, but it could describe one of a million flowers. I gave it a four star rating for the information of what each plant is used for. would really like to see a picture of each plant though.","This is an excellent book, very complete.  I have often thought that the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA are completely against this.  But certainly herbs are much cheaper to get than the traditional drugs.  Yes there is skepticism, but I have administered many drugs and am now old enough that I have to take some.  The Herbs have it!  And herbs are a lot more fun, as soon as I get a chance I will grow them in my glass house.","Dear Amazon.

B00761OU0C,"I read the reviews, I didn't think it was THAT bad. Okay, it needed more and was way too short.","This read like a junior high short story. The sex was stuttered and uninvolved, and the narrative itself was poorly written. Weak storyline; full of cliches; lacking emotion, imagination and a decent vocabulary. Don't waste your time.","The book started almost in an interesting way, but went never really made me care for the people, and suddenly it was strange and it ended!

Off to investigate. My advice buy the whole series one time wish I had.","So, I haven't even gotten past page three and I can't finish this...book. The writing is horrendous: ""He could get lost in them for day, or even years, he though."" Huh? What happened to editing? Spellcheck will only check for the correct spelling of a word; it does not check grammar.  Then, I run into this offensive little tidbit: ""The problem was that Jaime didn't like the typical gay guy."" Can you say stereotype? What's a typical gay guy. Never mind. I'll move on to another book.","If you get this book, which I got free, it will make you want to read the rest of the series.

I was actually looking for dual sim both working for GSM network. I haven't used this phone yet, but just looking inside the phone that is what i saw and find misleading at the moment. Just wanted to give little heads up for the potential buyers as I will be in vacation for next one month and would actually find out about the phone over there.

B007FWO19W,"This ""book"" - published on February 29, 2012 -- i.e., before Mr. Arpaio released the results of his ""investigation"" -- does nothing more than provide yet another piece of evidence that the investigation was a sham.

Of course, it makes sense that the ""book"" could be published before the ""investigation"" results were released to the public, since the results are nothing more than a rehash of WND's unsubstantiated claims made back in April 2011 -- and soundly repudiated by August 2011, before Arpaio even started his wild west show.

What a joke.  What a sham.  What a shame.","I  only have the sample download and knowing the credentials of the author (Jerome Corsi) of this book, I was dumbfounded to read  ""I was approached on this issue because I dislike  ""of""  the standard ...""  on page 2 of the introduction followed on the next page (page 3)  with  ""I instructed them to go at this investigation with no preconceived idea  ""that""  and I personally ...""

Their reviews are all about personally insulting the readers and the authors of this book.

The Obots have nothing to offer but gutter name-calling, insults and the typical Saul Alinsky tactics of ridicule and slander to lay upon decent patriotic Americans who only want the truth revealed about Barack Obama.

This book by Dr. Corsi and posse member Michael Zullo reveals the step by step process of honestly investigating and forensically  evaluating the various documents that Mr. Obama swears are true and accurate documents.  The authors of this book reveal that these documents are forgeries and frauds.

 This book is not about race, religion or national origin,... its about finding the truth and facts honestly.

B007Q2ZKD2,"I cried a lot in the first part of the book.  Janes death is heart wrenching to watch.  I would have loved this book so much better if there had been a true conflict.  Yes, Mrs Bennett needs a good smack, but it's not enough of a conflict.  I can't remember a climax in the story.","After reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, I can see how this book could be a very believable variation. Although a very sad one. I enjoyed the book very much. It is like no other variation I have read to date.","And a long year it is! Darcy resigns himself to being Elizabeth's caretaker as she mourns Jane's death...not a lot of romance. I'm still not sure why there was such detail paid to describing the coffin, body preparation, and mourning rings... It was a bit creepy. It's easy to see why Darcy would take responsibility for Elizabeth (he loves her by then) but a bit harder to believe that she would go off with him and Bingley after the estrangement from her family rather than go to the Gardiners. A little more romance and a little less mourning and it might have have gotten the fourth star...",Too much misery and misfortune. The characters cry way to much and are far to depressing but have no emotional depth. I expected a more tender and happy romance in place of Jane's death. It was struggle to finish this and was not worth it. I want my money back.,"Even though the idea of the book is intresting, I think many Austen fans would agree that the characters lost that passion they should have, it was cold and spoke too much of the pain they felt and not enough of other feelings, Mrs. Bennett seems cruel intstead of just silly, its not a book I would recommend too any P&P fan.","This book has unrecognizable characters and awkward wording. It is sad and melodramatic. There is no real way to see a relationship developing between Darcy and Elizabeth. It seems to defy conventions of the time. Fanny Bennet is cruel and not simply silly. How can she walk over her husband so? Why is he so weak? Elizabeth's relationship with the Gardiners is not developed, as that is a place she could have gone.  So much does not make any sense. Book ends abruptly with sudden happiness, but Fanny remains a villain. Dialogue is weak and Elizabeth is a weak character. Skis Bingley,","I have read a lot of P&P alternates and continuations, but this is one of the (fortunately) few that I could rate it so low. Too much misery and not enough of the true spirit of Elizabeth Bennett. She would not dishonor Jane in the way she acted in this story.","I am a fan of Jane Austen's books, and I also like the alternate takes on the romance of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They usually not an improvement on the original, but they are fun. This book is no exception.  It is well written and the characters are plausible. They are taken to a logical place implied but not reached by Austen. Mrs. Bennet is taken a step further away from being a self-centered histrionic to a malicious termagant. This is not really a stretch. Mr. Darcy is the unprideful gentleman he becomes at the end of the original from the time when he first starts to admire Elizabeth in ""Pride and Prejudice"". Elizabeth's unlikely infatuation with Wickham never occurs, and she is affected more intensely by her mother's spite, and less intensely by Darcy's careless slur. This book is a lovely conceit which I highly recommend to fans of the romance.","I read this when it was a work in progress on an online JAFF forum. It is one of the best variations I have ever read, and I have now read hundreds of them. If you are looking for an exciting, out of the box read, try this one. It is really very good. But, do not take my word for it. Download the sample and try it first. I think you will agree that it is worth a read.",It's amazing how a novel so full of misery for P&P's beloved characters can be so lacking in emotional depth. I suspect this was written by a computer and not a person.,"What a sad and emotional story! It was beautifully written. The plot was full of ups and downs and I couldn't keep crying. I didn't like this Mrs. Bennet at all. She was a really bad mother. It took a long time for Darcy and Lizzy to have happiness. I need my tissues, again, just thinking about it. Lewis, do keep writing. Maybe write something less sad next time. I don't want to spend money on buying tissues. I'd rather use it to buy your books.","I liked this story very much. I read it in one sitting and reread much of it the next day. There are a few issues that could be worked out better: I would have liked to have seen more of Elizabeth's fight come out. I did not find Mr. Bennet's reason for caving to his wife's unreasonable demands believable, so I would prefer a better reason. Also, I would have expected the Gardiners and LIzzy's sisters to take more interest in her; this could have added some additional conflict and tension to the story. Finally, I think a real confrontation between Elizabeth and her mother in which some kind of resolution occurs would have added to the story immensely.","I've read at least 100 P & P variations, and enjoy visiting my favorite literary characters. But the Lizzy and Darcy ( not to mention
Bingley and Georgiana) in this book bear absolutely no resemblance to Jane Austen's beloved creations. Her Lizzy would never have wallowed in self- doubt and despair, and her Darcy was no wimp! Save your money IMHO.","Love the premise, great story.  Heartbreaking, as Elizabeth loses not only her dearest sister forever, but also her father and her home.  That Mrs Bennet can blame Elizabeth for everything is devastating, if the sky turned purple, I am sure Mrs Bennet would blame her for that as well.","I loved this book when it was being first written.  Jane catches a cold and has to stay at Netherfield as is mentioned in Jane Austen's book. Unfortunately it turns out to be more that a trifling cold it becomes more, influenza and the pneumonia.  Poor Jane seems to get worse and worse.  All the time Lizzy is looking after her elder sister and is blamed by her mother for not looking after her properly.  Eventually Jane dies and Elizabeth is cast of by her family.  It is such a sad story in many ways but has a wonderful happy ending.  It is a lovely story and I would recommend it to all Jane Austen lovers.",this book has plenty of drama and sad twists and turns. great for those looking for a heart breaking tale.,a sad book with some awkward writing in it. some people may enjoy that. if you like being on an emotional roller coaster then this is for you.,"Readers found this book to be quite a different spin off of the original story, filled with a lot of unexpected sadness and despair. Despite this, most felt it was well-written given the genre.",

Waste of money  ! I am sending it back,Loved all the items I got they work great.. The price was right for all the items that  it came with and yes will recommend to others out there.,Great product  good quality l like everything about the holder and the accessories fill each and every charging need I have.,This is a great item for the price.  You get everything you need plus a nice leather case for your Kindle,"the case and screen protector worked just fine, but all of the chargers did not work. I tried them on the kindle that I had before and they did not work for that one either.",The charger doesn't work correctly and its cover doesn't perfectly matched the kindle and the price is affordable but quality was low.,It does not fit very well and the chargers did not worked well too. Screen covers are just in ok condition.,it appears that the general consensus is you get what you pay for.  the wall charger and case are the real negative factor with most of the reviews as it isn't working and fitting properly.  you do have a chosen few that think overall its a decent product.  either way you should do your own research before purchase.,
B007SJHHH0,"I purchased this as a gift for a teenager.  The color was a little too bright and after dropping it so many times, it started to crack. Eventually the phone ended up having a crack in the front.",I looked all over trying to fine the exact case I needed for my daugher in laws phone.  This was perfect. i LOVE that it has a built in screen protector.  Those that just stick on are incredibly hard to use and don't last. Exactly what she needed and wanted.  Now her phone is much safer and hopefully will last longer.  Case keeps the phone very well protected!,"The phone is an older generation of phone, so finding cases for it is very difficult. So I took my search to Amazon. The case.. is.. shit. Don't order it. I gave it two stars because I was lucky that the phone cases even existed and that it shipped like next day. But beyond that, it stinks.",the rubber cover does not stay on near the bottom of the phone. I have to keep playing with it so it doesn't come off.,"This is a very good case, but fragile also. it will break very easy if you don't know what you're doing.

At the price I wasn't sure what to expect but was very happy with it! It's rubber is a little thin but for the price you can't beat it. Very pleased!,This is a great little case. Works pretty well. The otter box defender for HTC is almost 50 bucks. I'd buy several of these and throw away as they go bad... before I'd buy a otter box defender.....at 50% bucks,This product is very cheaply made and broke immediately. It lasted about 4 days. save your money because it is not worth the 15 dollars,"Nice for the price, but unfortunately the belt clip falls apart only after 3-4 months of use. For the price, buy extra if you need the belt clip so you have a replacement on hand.",came on time. came before expected but case was damged. Received one that had been returned I'm sure and the previous receiver didn't know how to open. and wasn't the color I expected,the plastic is weak. the rubber is week. the screen protector is like clear plastic. feels so cheap. HORRIBLE. came on time though.,"I love this case, its easy to take apart when my phone malfunctions and not hard on the hands- but the rubberized purple part of the case makes it hard to put in my pocket and the bottom charger entrance cover broke off by the next day BUT it still stayed in tact. overall pretty nice",Thought this was a good case at first but not so much now. The rubber is too thin and tears real easily where you put the charger in. The white plastic is just cheap. Gonna be getting an Otterbox.,"This case was wonderful! My only complaint was little  rubber parts (the flaps that hold the rubber onto the hard plastic) they felt very flimsy I felt it if I pulled it out of my pocket too hard or too fast it would rip. The same goes for the flap covering the charger port.
Other than that it is an absolutely WONDERFUL case for the price and protection!","This is exactly what i wanted a sort of otterbox for an HTC but as i kept having to remove the memory card from my phone to put in my computer to upload images one of the little tabs on the side broke off & now the rubber cover doesnt stay on very well, so its a poor quality but i guess u get what u pay for seeing as how it was so cheap.",The mobile case cover is very protective which comes with the inbuilt screen cover so it will save your phone screen but the rubber is bit thinner which is totally fine for this price segment. The best part it receives on time. Overall the case is a good deal under this price category with timely delivery.,"this case is a very good deal for the money.  it is very inexpensive.   however, it can break rather easily. it breaks too easily and can be difficult to adjust.",a phone case with cheap and poor quality plastic. can be flimsy but it's what to be expected based on the low price.,

She also said some of the jewels were missing.  I told her that happens sometimes with buying items on line.,I love this case. I did put clear nail polish on the diamonds to help keep them from falling out.,"At first had little difficulty snapping the lower part of the cover, once I figured out, fits and I am happy with this product so far","The case fit well. But first time the phone dropped the case broke. It did get her on time, not worth returning.","This case is really nice.  I've got alot of compliments on it.  Only thing the rhinestones are falling off of the case.  They fall off very easy, just putting the phone in and out of your pocket",It does not look like the picture.  it has all the bling but it does not appear to have any design to it.  There are no differnt bling colors or the zebra pattern.,im so happy with this it cost way less than my phone so it is a good investment to protect my phone/11 don't have to worry anymore!!!,This was my favorite of the five I bought but it too did mot last long. Wish they were not to expensive to ship,"Rhinestones would shine more; this is basically a silver, beaded plastic.
Definitely wanted more bling, like the picture shows it",Non quality product. Wouldnt snap together right. Was part of a christmas gift for young daughters first phone. Not recommended.,Wanted some cheap bling for my Rumor Flex and this is eye catching and wasn't much. Some of the bling has rubbed off around the screen but not real noticable is why I give it 4 stars. :),It started falling apart a week after we got it and it was nice for a second .The value was good but the quality was kinda poor.,I loved this cover until it broke.  I cannot seem to put the top lid back on the phone. I really liked. it,"Purchased this for my granddaughter.  Was very pretty but when she put it on her phone, in less than a week it fell off the phone and couldn't be reused.","This case is cheap and beautiful, having a great cost benefit, however the brilliants that it composes are fragile and the case itself breaks very easily making it difficult to be inserted in the device.","This iphone cover is made out of plastic and so it is less durable and somewhat prone to breaking down the line.

Pieces fell off after 1 day of having it!!! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!,The crown fell off after a couple of weeks and the case started to turn blue from being taken in and out of pockets,"Crystals all fell off within three days of just normal wear and tear (putting into pockets, purses, etc). At least they didn't leave residue on the pink case so the case is still usable without the crystals.",I mean it is a very cute phone case and at a good price....BUT after the first day 4 rhinestones had already fallen off.,"TOOOO CUTE!! I was so excited when I opened this! It's even prettier in person!! SUPER FAST SHIPPING and great customer service! Thank you again, we will definitely order again!","the case is beautiful, inexpensive, fits perfectly and delivery is fast, but the crystals came off easily.","the case poses major problems for anyone who uses it. reviewers found it difficult to remove the case, and that is aesthetic design features degraded quickly under regular use. the product seems deeply problematic.",This phone case is very cute and light weight. However it is cheaply made as the crown beads are loosely glued and can come off. It is more decorative than durable.,
B007Y73CGQ,Love this case! It was exactly as promised. They even included extra pieces and glue just for safe keeping. I've not had to use it. I'm hard on cases but this one is still holding up perfectly.,This is a very cute case but the beads around the camera fell off within a week of using it.,Very Cute and I love that they send you  glue along with it in case you need it to touch it up.,Is a really cute case but the lace fell apart on my second day having it. It was not worth the wait. I'm disappointed. I suggest you don't buy it if you're gonna have your phone in your pockets a lot.,The case does not fit my iPhone 4.

Awesome product. Works better than expected and has the highest quality.

B008327Z6O,"The time hopping of the narrative is a little difficult to follow, but the story is a good one.  Looking forward to the next installment.","It is very easy to get the two chapter groupings backwards. If one were to begin reading chapter eight without having read chapters one through seven, the book would be a mess. However, if read in proper sequence, this can be a thoroughly enjoyable experience!","Well, I must say that I am certainly not disappointed with this book. I have yet to finish it, but so far (more than halfway)it is a very impressive storyline.
The first book was very, very good. I was not as impressed with the second instalment..chapters 7 back, but this one has more than made up for the inconsistencies.
The technology that the Author has dreamt up is phenomenal, the twists that have occurred to date are first-class.
A score out of ten would have to be 9...and I haven't finished the book yet!!! Well done, Steve.","I would move forward to the day when the next volume in the Omniverse goes on sale. I have thoroughly enjoyed all those thus far released, and frankly, I am fortunate I purchased the kindle format, else I would needed to tape the bindings a good bit. Well done Mr. Karmazenuk, Story has a great pace, and solid alternate vision. Waiting with anticipation, Dan in Chicago",The first book was good and it's been nothing but a slow slide with the next 3 culminating in an epic fail in book 4. It's timelines have no flow from paragraph to paragraph let alone chapter to chapter.,"This book is hard to follow. The chapters go back and forth in time without any way for the reader to figure out what is going on. I assumed the authors were trying to simulate some types of alternate reality, like what would happen if you went back in time and prevented your father from meeting your mother, but the end result was just confusing. Still..I will buy the next installment just to see what happens.","I Bought Both 1-7 and 8-14, entertaining. I just like to finish a series all at once, hate to wait 6 months and forget what happend before.",I`ve enjoyed the other books in the series but not this one.  Way to confusing.  The jumping around to different time points is a complete departure from the style of the other books.  There are some elements of this that i liked.  I really hope the conclusion makes this worth while but I`m going to wait for some reviews.  Also this each insallment should be given its own name.  Calling them Chapters _ to _ is pathetic.,"I have enjoyed every one of Karmazenuk's Omniverse books.

The story is great.
The characters are memorable.
The insights into people, religion and society are remarkable.
The description of future technology is thought provoking.

This book is engaging at every level due to the masterful blend of creativity and intelligence.
I find most fiction and especially most science fiction childish but Karmazenuk combines imagination with insight to create truly credible entertainment.
Some reviewers were confused by the fact that time travel might logically make it possible for a person or spaceship to be present more than once at the same moment.
(If I travel to yesterday I might find myself. If the two us then traveled to the day before there would be three of me.)

If the reader allows himself a little imagination this book makes for a fascinating and thought provoking adventure that might change his view of the real world.","The other reviewers write of how hard it is to follow, and that may be, but by the end I knew what was going on and was glad at the glimpses of the past (future version of the Grandmaster).  It leads up to a wonderful cliffhanger which left me wanting more...to find out more about this other Tribe of El-Ahur.  I, personally, cannot wait for the next installment :)",Series overall is pretty good.  This jumped around to much for me though.  Will still read what ever other books come after.,"WTH Steve! Loved the previous books but this one was hard to follow. I mean I couldn't keep track of who is who and what age, time, dimension, or whatever was occurring! Dude, put markers or years every time you flip back and forth! I don't know how you kept track as you wrote it! I hope you conclude this series with clarity and resolution.!",I have no idea what happened to this series. Book one and two were great but the authors have completly lost me with the Aeons war. Chapters One through seven were werid but at least they made sense. This book is very difficult to follow and to be honest is just not interesting. The series is now way to focused on religion and not nearly emough on scifi. Skip this book.,"Liked the books and to understand them all the previous books must be read.  Anyone with a bad memory will have trouble.  I personably would like to see the follow up book or books to come out a little quicker.  Months or possibly years is to long.  Would like to see how it all comes together.

Good story line  Write faster.","I didn't even get half way through this book, and I forced myself to get that far. I have no idea what's going on. The problem is part confusing writing and part BAD editing. Doesn't anyone read this stuff before it's published? What a sad ending for me to a fun series. I'm out. No more. Bye bye, Steve Karmazenuk. You had some really cool ideas. *sigh*

Please, someone let me know what happens to everyone in this book if any of you can figure it out. Thank you.","this series of the books has a good plot and characterization but it is bit confusing. the editing is average. the author has taken the continuation of the series in a good manner. overall, a good book to read.",the storyline is impressive but there is a lot of time hopping. this book has a sci-fi setting with a storyline also about religion. reading the prior books in the set help make reading this one easier to follow.,"this book is about time traveling and had an interesting concept to it past chapter 7. overall, the book needs a improvement to avoid confusion so the storyline remains specific and consistent.",

It gaped open on one side and the charger wouldn't fit with it on. He had to remove the cover to charge the phone.,when i got this cover the black part was broken but it fits my phone nicely. another i don't like is the cover makes it hard to press the power and volume buttons. over all it does what it is supposed to do so i would buy it again.,"Bought several cases to try, and this works great when I am at work.

I received a baby blue cover instead of teal.",love it...and can change covers at will this will be my happy day cover  which i am most days. but with the colors I ordered I can change daily to match my outfits...thanks,"At the time this case was only $.02 and $2.95 for shipping so I could not pass it up. The color was exactly what I expected from the pictures and it was very true to what it advertised. If you are looking for protection for your phone, I would not recommend this case. It is silicone so really only protects the phone from getting dirty and scratches. Overall a good product.","A little too big, easily starts coming off at corner. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 1747, may fit other models.","It's a loose fit and doesn't stay on the phone.  Comes off easily.  Also, the silicon is thick and a little gummy which makes it hard to slide into my back pocket.","I received the correct case and it is a very nice case, however,  it was not the correct color. When I contacted the seller he was very nice but informed me that the color I received was the only color he had. I was extremely disappointed.","It dose not stay on very well everytime i pick up my phone it comes off , I guess you get what you pay for","I personally do not like this case. It comes off all the time when I take my phone in and out of my purse or pocket. It is a pain in the tuckus. That being said it does what it says it does. It protects your phone. If you drop it often this case absorbs the shock. The hassle is worth it if you want to protect your phone.

The color is pretty.","*Color wasn't the same as the pic but I like it anyways! *It's more like a Magenta color which was ok with me! *Fit ok, but wasn't a tight fit! *Not bad for the price! =)","Silicone cases overall are all flimsy, that is an obvious. But Wherever I take my phone out of my pocket or purse, the case is sliding off. The case stretches way to easily. I would recommend getting a gel or rubber case instead. It is better than nothing though.","I absolutly love this color more than anything. I ordered 3 cases off of amazon (because they're so cheap, why not) and out of the three this is my 2nd choice. It does fit the phone well and i was really concerned that it would be too lose based on other reviews. Well it fits like any other soft case does; It fits, but it's easy to come off. Meaning if you want it on, it will most likely stay on, but if your playing with it or taking it out of your pocket, a corner might slip of. I didn't find this too annoying thou, only takes a second to fix. If you get this case your still gonna have to be careful with your phone. If you're a bit clumsy like be, I suggest ordering a hard, 2-piece case in addition. Also if you're ordering cases of amazon, doesnt hurt to order multiple because at these prices, they not seem like they may have great quality. Hope this helps!","I was really pleased when i received this cover, it's a beautiful color, i haven't seen anyone with this color and i really like that.","Love this case, I was looking for this exact case for a while now since all I could find would the slippery silicone cases and I had a gel one like this on my iphone before I got the galaxy so I'm happy I could find one and at a good price!",I could not get this case to stay on my s3. I almost broke my phone a couple times because the phone slipped out of the case while i was using it.,this phone case is pretty good in look and the silicon material also in good quality however some times they sent different colour of the product.,a phone cover made of silicon for the galaxy. it can fit a bit loosely but has a variety of colors.,A silicone based protector for your phone. It comes in assorted colors and is thick so it will absorb a shock from a drop.,
B008OSES58,This cover is pretty thin It looks good and keeps the iPhone compact. The cover helps maintain battery life because the screen does not turn on accidentally. i gave it a 4 rather than 5 because if you are looking for lots of protection (ie if you plan to drop your phone frequently :) then this is probably not the best protection . Realistically this is a 4.5 rating . Price is great,I thought the leather was thicker and more plush but it wasn't.  It still serves its purpose of protecting the phone from scratches.  It doesn't add to the weight of the phone which is good to me.  It doesn't weigh down my purse.  I'll use it till it wears out.,This is really pretty but the flip top is a pain.  I thought it would be like the old flip phones - no different than that.  It is different.  The cover interferes with the camera function on my phone.  Don't like it.,This case is very functional. The cover  flips  up instead of down. This is why I bought it. Good quality and workmanship.,"This is a great case for the iphone 5 - esp. for the price!
I constantly get compliments AND I have dropped my phone a few times already and no damage!  the front cover really does the job of protecting the glass.  The only drawback is that you have to hold the cover up when you take a picture - but that doesn't bother me at all.","This iPhone 5 looks nice in the picture, but the actual product doesn't look as good. Hope I did not buy it.","it's not too big, the magnet closure works well (it's only been a week though) the plastic tray holds the body of the phone snugly.  I left the plastic on the front of the phone until I get a proper plastic protector for the face of the phone.  It's light, nice color kind of a light burgundy.  The front can be folded back behind the body of the case so that it isn't flapping all around while you are using it.  Who can say if that will eventually cause the front cover to break off, but I won't borrow that trouble from tomorrow!  Today, I am enjoying the case.  This will buy me time to investigate a real ""protective"" case for the phone.  It arrived as promised and was packaged appropriately.  I would order from this seller again.",The red plastic inner case left red color on sides of my white iPhone. Never ever buy this flip case unless you have a black iphone5.,"good fast delivery; product ok for the price, i've had it for about 2 weeks, and the threading coming appart already. I do love the Color. I would not say is a Premium Leather Case.","This case is great. It fits the iPhone 5 perfectly. The phone just snaps into place. The little tab has a small magnet that holds the case shut, and you can flip the tab backward to hold the case open while using the phone. The red is nice and rich. Great price!
Update: After a few months the threads have started to come out of the sides. I have to clip them every couple weeks. Still a nice product and the leather/color has held up well, but not the fanciest option.",This case looks more expensive than it was. It has a nice magnetic lock and is highly functional...but a bit awkward for picture taking.,"It was cheap, and it feels like it.  Flimsy side and the leather stitching is fraying already. Don't buy it.","This case is attractive and effective as a protector for my iphone 5. However, the threads began to show signs of fraying soon after I got the case, so I find myself babying it a bit.","This case is exactly what I was looking for.  I feel I have better screen protection without increasing the bulk of the phone.  Unlike other flip cases, this one also has side coverage which I love.  I did take the liberty of decorating the otherwise boring look, but that's just personal preference. Love this case, love the price, and the shipping was lightning fast.","The case is classy but not showy. It fits my iPhone 5 (ATT) perfectly. The fact that the cover flips from the bottom up is helpful for taking photos in landscape view as it provides something to hold on to away from the lens on the phone.

I'm giving it only four stars because the inside lining which touches the phone is hard plastic. I would have preferred a soft fabric, so I left the protector that came on the phone from the factory on the back to protect it from scratches.","the case fits the phone nicely, it is pleasing aesthetically and easily affordable for most people. it has a magnetic look and the cover flip-up is very functional.","customers love the product, but it has minor inconvenient features, so the product gets some backlash","This is a red imitation leather Iphone 5 protective case. The cover flips open and is held closed by a magnet. The cover makes taking pictures a bit more difficult, but a nice case overall for the money.",
B008SA15KI,"...what's more funny: this short by Garner or that so many reviewers apparently have no idea what satire is. Either way, the very existence of this Kindle Single makes for some diverting reading.

Readers will likely find these purposely-absurd ""fairy tales"" at least a little entertaining, especially those currently unenthused with the satirical target, the American Taliban--or ""The Tea Party"" for those with sensitive palates.

Be aware that this short is a) not a book for children and b) not meant to get glowing reviews from tea partiers. Still, it is comedy and humor is subjective. In my opinion 'Tea Party Fairy Tales' is a quick, entertaining, snort-laughing good time; made more so by the bad reviews, which compelled me to buy and read 'Tea Party Fairy Tales'.

Favorite line: ""Moral: Don't cloud your resolve with facts.""

Compare to: Andy Borowitz, Onion News, Stephen Colbert.","This was at best a waste of my time and money and neither of those are very costly. nothing in the league of Politically correct bedtime stories.

I give it one star just to show I read it.","As a bleeding-heart liberal, I thoroughly enjoyed each and every cheap shot James Finn Garner takes at the Tea Party and other self-proclaimed super-patriots. Any true liberal will enjoy this book. And if you're a staunch conservative with a weak ability to detect sarcasm, you'll enjoy Tea Party Fairy Tales, too. This book has it all. In the first story alone you have survivalists, semi-automatic pistols, geriatric dementia, murderous little girls, crooked ATF agents, and Urban wolves. I stopped reading my free download of Ivanhoe to read TPFT, and I'm glad I did. It's WAY funnier and more timely than Ivanhoe. You'll agree. Stop reading Fifty Shades Of Gray and download Tea Party Fairy Tales right now!","Seriously?
If you have a moral compass of a ""Survivor"" competitor.....you will love this book!  No value...just right wing political spin!","I loved it, but I'm not sure that some of the tea partiers I know would pick up on the irony.","Thought it might have some merit but it was less entertaining than expected and not all that creative. Oh well, the Tea Party is something of a fairy tale anyway.","When I bought this book I didn't know what to expect, had no idea what it was about.  So far I can't get interested in it.  May try again later.","Great read. Laughed my______off.  I have recommmended to many if my friends,  Got to love Jack and the Bean Stock.",This was the first title I have read from this author. It showcases the crazy positions that tea party people take on many issues. This book would not be entertaining for angry tea party types. Using story book tales to demonstrate the lack of reasoning in tea party thinking is very effective.,This is a wonderful collection of tongue-in-cheek twistings of familiar tales. I recommend it to anyone who gets a little annoyed at simplistic answers to complex questions.,"Better than his PC bedtime stories but but another case of picking on easy targets. Have yet to meet those Tea Partiers able to take themselves lightly enough for this book, but it distracts anti-TPers from looking at the tea leaves in their tempestuous pot.",I was left wanting more. I read the stories out loud to my husband while we were on holiday in Ireland to distract him from the stress of driving there. I might have to download Mr. Finn Garner's other politically-skewed works!,"James Finn Garner is back on his game.  In the early 1990s he skewered the political correctness bug that had infected our country.  Now he takes aim at the Tea Partyers.  It's a mix of Steven Colbert and Garrison Keilor.  Tongue firmly planted in cheek, he nails 'em.  You really have a hard time figuring out if he's serious or not.  My favorite was his take on Snow White.  I can't reccommend this book highly enough.  If you're a Tea Party member, you'll probably read this to your kids verbatim.","For those who may wonder, this is not a book for children.  It's meant to be adult sarcasm.  Plenty of cheap shots at conservative values. I don't mind a cheap shot here and there if they are funny, but I read the entire book (in 30 minutes) and never found a funny moment.  Nothing clever, nothing insightful, nothing witty.  A waste of money and more importantly, a waste of time.",Fabulously entertaining and thought provoking at the same time. Obviously the title lets you know the audience the book aims at. But its not just for Tea Party followers. If you are proud of the fact that YOU DID BUILD IT then this is a great read for you. The author channels Grimm and Aesop in a personally responsible interpretation which questions authority and control at the expense of freedom.,"a book written by james finn garner which uses sarcasm to take a look at conservative values and the current tea party. garner takes a look at tea party beliefs and values, while interjecting his version of humor.",the book is mostly for tea party followers and not for childrens to read.,the short story is funny. it talks about the tea party and makes fun of conservative values. it is not meant for children.,special case
B008UR3L6A,This was absolutely amazing reading. It made me want to keep reading and reading. It was hard to put down and go to bed. I wanted to finish.,"Oh, Lisa. You poked your nose into the wrong business here, didn't you? Not that I can blame her -- as a music journalist, Club Other would have been like... uhh, waving a rare steak in front of a hungry werewolf. Generally speaking, things don't end well for the steak. Just saying. Except that in my analogy, Club Other would have been the steak. THIS MAKES NO SENSE! Okay. Use your imagination.

Anywho. Lisa gets tangled up in something she wasn't prepared for and hunky Toby steps in to save her. Toby gets some quality outdoor boning time, Lisa gets a wolfish lover. I think everybody wins in this scenario. Oh, and there's a bad guy. He wants to do horrible, nasty, no-good things to Lisa -- including, but not limited to, killing her and disposing of the body. Good thing she has Toby to keep her safe!

Time for book 2 now!

-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal","This was only 17 pages.  I mean, why even waste the effort on 17 pages?  It was like the author took one of her high school creative writing assignments and added a bunch of random sex.  Totally weird.  There was nothing even tempting about the story that made me want to read anything else by this author.","HOT, Erotic, Unexpected, shocking and exciting.  Loved it.  Not just a porno in a book...but an actual story line that pulls you in to an incredibly hot story.","Really enjoyed this story but way to short!!

Just not my cup of tea.,"I found it a bit odd that a club like the one our MC visits could exist in a big city, even if they make a habit of killing nosy onlookers.

B008ZCO1QY,"Love the case.  Perfect fit, great protection, minus the top and bottom section.  Granted, leaving the top and bottom open allow for easy access to accessories and docks.  The texture of the case makes it less 'grippy' than the S4's naked shell.  Wish it was a little less 'slick'.",This case doesn't cover the whole samsung galaxy s4. I dropped my phone with the case on and it fell right where it wasn't and cracked my brand new phone. I had to spend $250 to fix the damn phone after having it for 1 week.,"I heard about KaysCase from a friend on YouTube and am very pleased with the quality and speedy shipping. Their customer service is also excellent, they replied to my e-mail almost immediately late at night to change the shipping address. The case has a slightly rubberized texture and feels sturdy. It snaps right on my Galaxy S4 tight with no wiggle and all of the ports have ample space. This case is great because of how slim it is, and protected my phone from a fall with only a scuff mark on the case and no damage to my phone!

They also sent me a free bumper case, which is also great quality and I use it from time to time as well. KaysCase is only a couple dollars more than the really cheap Chinese cases, but that couple dollars makes a big difference and you see it in the quality.

I highly recommend  ordering from KaysCase, and I already purchased another case from them.","bought this case to simply protect the rear facing camera and screen from contact with the surface( there is a lip that gives the screen about a 1mm clearance).  this case is not meant for drop protection; think scratch protection. also comes with a screen protector.  for about $9, it can't be beat.  met and exceeded expectation","Thin case that provides good protection against scratches. The case has no logos and really showcases the beauty of the phone which was a feature I was looking.  Overall, for the price it is a really nice clear case.",The case is good quality and easy to grip. highly recommended  for all Samsung GalaxyS4 users. They have great customer service thats a plus.,"I got several cases when I first got my Galaxy S4, because while I like the phone, the design of the phone made me feel like it was going to slip out of my hands really easily. Also, the was a big sale (about half off) on a bunch of these cases. This fits fine over the phone, and is pretty clear so you can see the phone design, but I hate it because it makes the phone even slicker. There is no hardly any grip to this case what so ever, so it feels a little like trying to hold on to ice. I'm pretty sure if I used this case, I'd have to fix my phone, or buy a new one within a week because I was dropping it so much. I would not recommend this case unless you have insurance on your phone.","The case is made of poor material.  It has cracked in two places since the 9 days i have had it.  I have not dropped it, and the cracks are due to the top left part of the device not being perfectly fitted.  I purchased the white one.

Save yourself some headache and purchase a different brand.",I bought this cover for my new Galaxy S4 and had only positive things to say about it until about 2 weeks of it being in use on my phone. That is when I noticed small cracks starting to form on all four corners where the cover curves around the corners of the phone. It is really too bad this happened because it is a nice color and I really liked the feel of this cover but if it only lasts two weeks it's not worth it even for the minimal price.,Case is nice looking but cracked on its own from just the fit and weak points.  Still usable with a little tape.,"I purchased this cover exactly 1 month and a half ago. So far I am completely unsatisfied with this purchase. Here is a quick rundown.

Pros:
Fits very well
Very thin case
Looked great when new

Cons:
Not durable whatsoever
Only offers superficial protection to phone's finish

The screen protector supplied is of low quality. The matte finish stains very easily. This cover already has micro cracks on the edges in two places. The finish is peeling up everywhere there is an edge on this cover. This phone has never been dropped with this cover, and the only thing used to clean it has been dish soap and water. This is a total waste of money. Take my advice and look elsewhere because I'm sure there are better covers available at a comparable price. I never tried to contact the manufacturer as I'd rather not have them ship me more junk, and I wouldn't feel right asking for my money back, and then leaving this review. I would not recommend this cover to anyone.",Looks great but turned out to be very fragile.  Left upper side broke after only the first fall.  Looks slick but not durable.,"This case might not be a bad choice (for the money) if you're a careful phone user, but if (like me) you drop your phone from time to time then this case will not be sturdy enough for you. I dropped the phone with case onto concrete. The phone remained functional, but the case cracked beyond use. I think most cases can handle a fall from your hand to the concrete much better. If you know that you're clumsy or accident prone then buy a better case.",came on time. Was surprised to find an enclosed screen protector- Thank you for that. Put everything together. My samsung s4 beauty not hidden by the case- kudos to the clear and slim case. But I do not think it will protect the phone if it slips down. It does have a grip. Overall it is a good case.,perfect buy for those who  want to protect their new galaxy 4 phone...fits snug and perfect to protect the new phone...a must have...thank you...,The case looks was nice. Grip of the case is one of issue and The corner is likely to come up with frequent trouble. But  i will protect our mobile as well.,"the case is beautiful, it fits well, it is easy to handle, but it is fragile, after a while it starts to crack in the corners. it's a good case to protect against scratches but not drops.","it is a good case, fits well and is beautiful, besides having a low cost, but the material is fragile and not durable, nor does it protect well against drops.",
B0091V9BPE,I have no idea where all the glowing reviews came from. This is an extremely short story. It only goes to 60% then it's over. And Sara doesn't even know this guy's name until 55% through the book. This is AFTER he gives her oral in a restaurant and intercourse on his secretary's desk. Talk about low standards! I have no idea what the conflict was supposed to be. I deleted this book from my kindle and I will NOT be reading the other books on this series.,Has a good story plot and is very well written. I recommend reading it. Also has samples of similar work SPSM,"Aimlie Aames can *write*!  The lady's truly a gifted wordsmith, not only layering beautiful descriptions but painting her characters with a fine brush.  The contrast between this and many of the other 'billionaire' books out there really can't be overstated.  Aames spins a mean plot, too, with some genuine surprises.  It's nice to see a heroine who actually has a mind of her own and who isn't about to submit at the drop of a hat... because it makes it all the hotter when she does finally melt for Brazier (as we all would!)

That's not to take anything away from the sex - which is as hot and abundant as you could want.  It's just that this is one of the rare erotic romances where you genuinely want to find out what happens next, and can really find yourself rooting for the characters.  I'll now be following this author with great interest to see what she comes up with next.","I would have been ready to give this book 4 if not 5 stars, I was completely enthralled with this book.......until it suddenly ended on a cliffhanger at 60%. And then gives an excerpt into the next book Part 2. Lust and Lies that ends at 83%. Its a good thing I had gotten this book as a freebie or else I would have been really ticked. The next books are each 2.99. And are likely just as short. This is a horrible marketing ploy and has completely ruined the fact that this was a great story.........a story that I will not continue.","I love Aimelie Aames use of descriptive language. I liked the start of this series, which gives a free taster, an opening only, this is why I am sticking to four stars. I dislike purchasing serials and am well known for complaining of such. However, I now know this is a full novel so am off forthwith to buy said story and then hopefully it will stand as well alongside Aimelie's other works I've read.
This is a paranormal story, werewolf by implication but not all clear as yet. Communication between life and death is it? Oh, and a spectacularly creepy note written in blood from the mysterious Journeyman are things I am now curious to find out about. But Aames erotic and BDSM scenes are so good, like an exquisite Swiss chocolate bar to savour.
4 stars for the freebie opener and I'm off to get the novel.","Characters are not really interesting. There is no one to really root for. And when the main female character says she goes in for lunch every single day but can't afford to tip, I was completely appalled by this confession.",The submissive and dominant sides of the story are really good. The twist of her being some sort of a spy was a let down for me at least.,This is a short story where a woman named Sara finds herself doing things she doesn't quite understand and with a man who she is drawn to in ways she can't explain. The storyline is well written and is different from the usual takes on the paranormal.  The characters are sexy and mysterious and keeps the reader looking to see what's in store next.  The story is to be continued in the next book and I am looking forward to see what Sara has in store for us.,"First, I have to say that I really enjoyed the author's writing style and would have read the book just for the flowing prose and lush little details, but the best part is that she spins a great story too.

It starts out much like the ""billionaire"" romance story structure I'm sure we're all used to by now, but then it diverges from there in some very interesting ways. The hero in the story is just the right kind of dangerous and smoldering sexy, and the heroine has intrigue of her own, as we find out in a twist. The sex is just the kind of needing-to-fan myself hot that I love, without being gratuitous or overdone. I also enjoyed the hints of paranormal lore interspersed and look forward to seeing more of that in the next book!","This isn't what I would or could call a romance. It defiantly is BDSM, and paranormal. Thought not sure how far the paranormal extends because unfortunately this is so short its an installment of a book. There are 3 more of these shorts you have to buy to get the whole story. This is a marketing tactic I detest. While I liked this short better than the other one of hers I read, both are installment shorts rather than whole stories. I doubt I will bother reading any more of her ""books"" as a result of this marketing ploy.","I was not impressed or entralled  with this book.  It was hardly BDSM, one could say it contained some erotica.  Okay, if labeled that way.  Then there is some paranormal, but until the last page one would never know.  I felt the author thought ok what's selling now: Werewolves-check; vampires-check; BDSM-check and so on.  There are so many plots and subplots, and none that are truly fleshed out, that I lost interest fast. The story is not cohesive. It's like a 12 headed snake and they can't decide which one should direct the tail.","The first half of this was good, if a little cliche. The poor girl who nabs the billionaire's eye has been done and done again. Unfortunately the whole thing fell apart when it took a drastic left turn from its plot up to that point and then just ended at 60%. (The remaining 40% appeared to be a preview of the next instalment. I didn't bother reading it.) I'm sorry, but that ticks me off. This is not a complete story. It doesn't end on a cliffhanger, it ends on an incompletion. I was left with more questions than answers and there were more open threads than closed....wait, there were no tied up threads. NONE. At a stretch it could be considered the first chapter of a longer work, but if you take that route then you're faced with having to pay for each and every chapter. No. I refuse. The author can obviously write. I have no complaints in that department, but I will not be continuing this series.","Aames has fused the paranormal with the popular billionaire sub-genre in a way that's electrifying! Her Billionaire, Her Wolf is the perfect cocktail of erotic writing, supernatural imagery, and just plain good storytelling.

When you get into the story, you'll find that passion waits, tempered beneath a shroud of mystery that makes turning the pages irresistible. Sara's long sought liaison with the handsome stranger she's watched from afar is only the beginning.

Soon, she's drawn into the hard world of Mr. Abraxis, owner of the company where she works as a temp, and seemingly the wider world. In this tale, absolute power doesn't corrupt absolutely. It corrupts with beautiful lust, scenes of smokey domination that definitely made my Kindle a few degrees warmer.

The writing? Magnificent.

Aimelie Aames is an excellent craftswoman. She wields her pen with real presence, equally capable of teasing, shocking, and making you pause with breathless fascination to appreciate her awesome scenes.

Her Billionaire, Her Wolf is an interesting bridge between two erotic romance tropes, and it's sure to appeal to fans of both brooding billionaires and primal alpha wolves. Five stars!",A very disappointing read not a book that I would purchase.  I can only hope that the author has written better,"Unloaded it from my kindle app, just not my ""cup of tea""...if you are into this kind of thing you will enjoy it, just read the excerpt really well to be sure....","book has mixed reviews, as some enjoyed the bdsm content and writing style, and others did not.","this short, erotic book is a first in a series. the ending of this one will leave you wanting more. the characters are well-written and there is an interesting blend of billionaires and the paranormal.","the book has a good plot and interesting characters, but the story is too short, and it is necessary to wait for a sequel.",
B0096HVJGM,"Although the case looks just as described, is super cute and adds no extra bulk to my phone, I was only able to use it for about two weeks and then I had to just throw it away.

B0098FKJXQ,"Too hard to push the top on / off button.  If you push really hard, it'll work about 1/2 the time.  Sent back to Amazon and will try the Speck Candyshell Grip.","Like many others I had this case for my iPhone 4 and loved it.  Inexpensive, fit well, felt good in my hand, and protected my phone.  This new one for the iPhone 5 is pretty much the same.  Reason for 4 star rating, like many others, the button on top of the phone is difficult to press and the back edge has a slightly sharp edge to it.  Neither is a deal breaker for me.  If Incipio had kept it same as before, would have been a 5.","After 11 months of daily usage the case has stretched maybe a millimeter to allow some wiggle room, but has been great otherwise. Has outlasted 2 iPhone 5S's!","As others stated it is hard to push the top button.  I put a piece of paper between the phone and the case, and it works great.  It was thin cardboard from a chewing gum package folded in half.",Just what I wanted and here in two days!,Created massive bubbling on the sides of my screen protector and it did not have as snug a fit as I expected.,"I ordered this NGP case for my iPhone 5S straight from the NGP website.  I paid a bit more because I figured I would be getting their latest design production rather than old stock.  It fits the 5S perfectly.  However the power/sleep button is hard to press compared to the NGP case on my iPhone 4S.  There is something different about the design for that button between the two models, and I don't think that Incipio has completely fixed the issue.  At the same time, I don't think we should exaggerate how bad the problem is.  Even though it is harder to press the button, the amount of force is reasonable so it doesn't accidentally get pushed inside pockets, and I am still happy that I bought this case for my iPhone 5S.  I've used many different cases and the NGP is still my favorite since it provides outstanding protection considering how slim it is.  I would still buy this again.","Don't buy this case, it's terrible. (I bought mine off FAB, should've known there was something up with these.)

Pros:
It fits
You get the intended thin body of the iPhone 5

Cons:
The plastic is cheap feeling and stiff
The edge near the screen will get under your screen protector and peel it off at the corners
The power button is a workout to push and the plastic is like holding down a guitar string, you need some calluses
By trying to mimic the lines of the phone body in the case, the edges are ""sharp"" or ""rough"" on the back of the phone, making it uncomfortable to hold
It's really slippery for me, I'm all for getting it in and out of my pockets easily, but I'd rather it not feel like a stick of butter.
It looks like you won it after turning in some skee ball tickets.

Pass.  Find something else.  If I could return, I would.","This is a great case for the iPhone 5.  It is also a good value for the money.
Would definitley recommend this case","The shiny ""metallic"" back scratched too easily and it's quite thick. I bought another Incipio product instead and LOVE it. So, it's just this particular model that's not worth the effort.","I like the feel, I like the color. But, like other reviews before, the edges are sharp and not as rounded as previous models and the sleep button is very stiff. Clickable but needs pressure. I had an incepio case for the iphone 4 and was amazing. This newer model is a step in the wrong direction. Still a great case protects well and very low profile. Just a couple small complaints. Worth the 10 bucks or however much it is on amazon.","I had the same kind of case for my 4S and loved it.  This one is not my favorite.  The power button has to be pressed REALLY hard to even work and the edges on the back side are actually pretty sharp.  Overall, not very impressed.","Its a nice, quality case and i really like the look and feel of it and its very protective as well","Having owned the NGP case for iPhone 4, I will say that this one is an obvious step down in quality and usability. As others have mentioned, the bottom area does not sit flush to the phone, curving outwards. I'm not sure if this is due to manufacturing issues or poor design.  However, the most glaring flaw (also previously mentioned) is that the top button takes too much effort to push. I fixed this MacGyver style by sticking layers of tape (cut into tiny rectangles, scotch or electrical will do) on the inside concave area where the case makes contact with the button. It is  ridiculous that I had to engineer such a solution. Had Incipio done a bit more testing instead of rushing the product to market, they would have realized that they would have needed to fill in said area with a bit more plastic.","Very functional indeed, but also very boring design",overall is a pretty quality case with good functionality. it feels a bit stiff but it does a fantastic job at protecting an iphone and it's built to last. the biggest flaw is that it can be a bit hard to push the top button.,Some buttons may require extra but reasonable pressure to push. Overall good value for the price after a short adjustment period to the new case shape and design.,"This is a fairly standard and inexpensive iPhone case. There are some flaws in the design (the top button is hard to push) and the materials it's made from have a cheaper feel. Overall, this case will fit your phone and work as intended.",2 disagreements

In my opinion, this is well worth the money & a must read for any TWD fan.","It's a short story that ties in the first two books oft he ""Governor"" series together. DO NOT BUY if you already have issue#1 of the magazine because it 's the same story from it. So if you'd rather have it in print buy it that way.",Very persona lifel story one who need to know. Very entrainment to own one,"Basically, you are paying for a preview the first two chapters of ""The Road to Woodbury"".  ""Just Another Day At the Office"" is a VERY short story.  It's about 1/3 as long as a chapter in one of the two Walking Dead books so far. And, it doesn't really add anything to the plot and is barely worth reading.  Knowing what I know now I would not have bought it; I would rather have my 99 cents back. I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead, but this should be free given its poor quality and value.

I wonder if the people giving it good reviews hadn't read ""The Road to Woodbury"" yet.  It might be a cheap way to give the first two chapters of that book a try.  But, I'd buy that book before I'd waste my 99 cents here.  And, the original excerpt is definitely very short and uneventful and definitely not worth the 99 cents.","I was pretty bummed that you really only get a few pages of content...the story itself was worth reading, but the first chapter of the next book took up more space than this story did.","Over half of the number of advertised pages were a preview of the next book. Otherwise, it was a good story.",Great story but the free preview is almost the whole story. It wad almost a waste of the purchase price.  Maybe it could be longer by providing more introduction info about the rescuers.,I am a avid watcher of The Walking Dead and it def. gave me a better insight of the Govenor while watching.,It's pretty good. But my son thought it wasn't super great. He thought it was worth the money though.  :),this is a teaser with a short excerpt  and a what's soon to come of the next book. for the walking dead fan.,"it is a good short book, easy to read, but the story is very short.",a book which gives insight to the governor from the walking dead. it is fast paced but can also be a bit short.,
B009GSEHR4,"Just do yourself a favor and buy tempered glass for the front of your phone, it's about 40 bucks which may seem like a lot but it's worth it. I still use the back part of the screen cover just because I'm a scratch nazi. They work fine just scratch like anything else does",I thought I was going to receive five front and back screen protectors. I just opened the package and there is only one cover for the front of the screen.... Why?,"The price is great, hands down.  But you get what you pay for.  These are a great fit for the phone and they fit with my otterbox without peeling on the edges.  However like an earlier review mentioned, it does blur the screen a little bit and makes it a bit difficult to read, especially if you're accustomed to no screen protector at all.  Great quality for the price, but I'm going to replace it with an HD screen protector from Zagg here soon. If you're on a budget and don't mind a little less sharpness and clarity, this is the deal for you though.","Feel good to touch and see.
Just one minor problem, the top part of back cover is easy to fall off, but luckily I got five ones here.",it is not like it shows in the picture. the back it is not separate its one whole thing so it gets some air in the top and in the bottom. i got this package because of the picture so im not that happy about it,I ordered the ANTI GLARE SCREEN PROTECTOR. Actually the pack was written ``Anti Glare``but the product inside isn`t what I ordered. DON`T BUY IT.,"The price (especially since it includes a rear protector) is great.  However, having used a number of screen protectors, I have found that the matte finish of these is unacceptable.  If you are worried about fingerprints, you may be tempted to go this way but I was disappointed.  It turns out that the matte finish slightly blurs the image and makes fine print less readable.  Not much point in having a Retina Display screen if you use this protector.",Perfict fit. I love the anti glare. Five sets of front and back protection in this LOW price? You should not miss this deal!,"I like these screen protecters, really tough and sleek... it was a little rough to the touch though... But otherwise really nice, at an unbeatable price. Good Job","its a regular screen protector, but the screen protector for the back is cut in 3 pieces instead of 1 regular piece, 2 small pieces for the top and bottom glass part, and then 1 middle piece for the metal part, this isn't in the description and its horrible looking","the quality is not good, but on the other side, it is quite cheap. so you can balance between the price and quality","I bought this this item 2 days ago, shipping was really fast I like it, but I don't like the screen protectors, I cleaned my iPhone 5 screen and try it to put it on everything was good, 2 minutes later screen protector was coming out there was a lot bubbles,  I tried to put another one, still same shit, don't buy it","Good quality  it fits my phone perfectly, great protection for my iPhone front-back and i got a good price from this shop i live inGermany it costs about 5  for 3 front screen protectors I'm very impressed definitely going to buy more stuff from this shop again!",A good product with a low prize. The delivery was really fast. The product is just as shown in the picture and described in the information!!!,These were awesome for my iphone 5. The only problem was that they scratched fairly easily.

However, the quality is not very good and the product description can be confusing. ",
B009GSWUNM,"Poorly written and poorly edited.  This book describes a situation that is rape in any state in the US, yet, the main character blames herself for being taken advantage of, leaves her community at the behest of women who should have protected her, returns at the behest of one of those women, and falls prey to the very man who raped her while she is seriously considering him for a husband.  The flow of the story demonstrates a seriously disturbing lack of understanding of the issues of sexual exploitation.","Poorly written, jumped back and forth and had so many grammatical and spelling errors that I finally just quit reading it.",I really enjoyed this boxed set. I have read a lot of books by Sicily and have enjoyed them all. They are all well written.,"I was actually looking forward to reading this set because I like books about the Amish. But I was massively disappointed when I started reading. I noticed where the author said she'd hired a new editing and proof-reading team. Well, she needs to fire them. That was the most awful set of books I've ever tried. The amount of grammatical, spelling, and sentence structure errors throughout these books would be very embarrassing to me had I written such an atrocity. The content of the stories themselves was somewhat flighty as if the plot had been lost. No, I don't claim to be perfect, but I definitely feel I could have done a much better job.",I had a very hard time reading this book since it seemed so choppy and did not flow very well.  It seemed to jump around and some of the story line did not mesh together.  It left me questioning every situation and trying to understand the characters and the whole story.,Good Job!!! Requirement of more words to be written is ridiculous!  I'll not write more than this.  Thanks for your service.,"I really enjoy reading amish fiction. the recipes were a bonus. I will be buying more ""Amish Washdays"" books by Sicily Yoder","I enjoyed reading this book.  All the recipes were enjoyable and so were the short stories.  Sicily Yoder is a truly gifted writer.  I am so encouraged by her writing and reading about the Amish women in these stories makes me want to clean my house and make some bread.  Thank you Sicily for another successful book. You are truly blessed by God, keep up the good work.","Good read but too short.  Story's good,over before I wanted them to be.
I realize this a sampler . I did liked the recipes.",IT was very confusing to read.  There was a lot of misspellings and names were mixed up. Wouldn't recommend it.,Not as good as other Amish books I have  read. Was not what I expected or it would be about.,love everything by this author all stories are interesting and keep you wanting more. great amish fiction if you love amish fiction a must read.,I enjoy these short stories of Amish families.  Amish women and men seem to very hard working and the receipes that they shared are  maybe worth a try if I was cooking for a big family.  I just enjoy reading about their customs and their lives in general.,I just really enjoyed the book. There was always some thing around the corner to mix things up that you didn't see coming.,I would recommend this book to young readers interested in the Amish lifestyle. I enjoyed it very much. I always enjoy reading about other cultures and religions.,"The stories about amish life and the amish recipes are enjoyable, although they do seem to have a lot of spelling and grammer mistakes.",a book set about amish life. has some grammar as well as spelling issues. can be a bit hard to understand because it jumps all over the place.,"this is a book for anyone interested in reading about amish life. it might have some controversial takes that may offend some readers, particularly about sexual assault and rape.",

They are now greenish and really ugly.,"I received this before the due date,and I expected a lot more from this case. But what can I say it was only $3 and change, but other than that it is nice. The case fits snug to the phone and I like the glossy finish on the back.","Arrived sooner than expected. I have about 5 of these polka dotted covers in different colors and the only reason I didn't give it a fifth star is because the back of the case, where the polka dots are, is glossy and the sides are not, so the sides of the case trap dirt and get dingy.","this case is fine,looks close to the picture. It can be a little wider to cover more of the front.",This iPhone 5 cover was just as the picture showed. Very nice. It also came in sooner than expected. Happy with product.,"This case is very rubbery,

I now use it here and there to decorate my phone, but theres nothing amazing about it.

Arrived quickly!",Case is thick and the edges are kinda rough.  My girlfriend likes polka dots so I figure I'd get something new for her.  The case came after a few weeks of waiting.  It's a bit like hard rubber -- e.g. semi-flexible.  The color is really bright so it's not really yellow but like a neon/hot-yellow.  What I don't like is how the plastic/rubber feels and the rough edges.  It also adds a noticeable thickness to the phone.  The phone ended up not fitting in the elago aluminum stand anymore.  For the price it's alright.,"It's great, fits perfectly. It's bright yellow just like the picture and is very snug on my phone. It also has a nice sized lip to protect the phone if it falls on its face.",Looks like the picture and fits the phone great. Exactly what I was looking for and a good price. Love it!,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CASE!! IT FITS SNUG AND THE COLOR IS GORGEOUS. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE SIDES GOT STAINED FROM HAVING MY PHONE IN MY BAG AND JEANS POCKETS. ALSO THE RUBBER ON THE SIDES IS A LIGHTER SHADE FROM THE COLOR ON THE BACK. I WILL MOST DEF ORDER ANOTHER ONE ONLY THIS TIME I WILL MAKE SURE NOT TO STAIN IT WITH MY CLOTHING.,i have yet to receive this case. first time was correct style but wrong color and then the second time right color but for the wrong kind of iphone.,I like this case a lot. I thought it would be more cheapier material but it is decent and not flimsy at all. I did expect it to be more snug though. It's not like it easily comes off or anything but it isn't super snug.,I like the casethe only bad thing is the sides turn green in your pocket.

I love the owl and the little animals everywhere!  Its definitely a lot sturdier than any of the cases I've ever owned, and they were sold to me by my phone company!  The only reason I scored it down, was because the color wasn't quite as bright as it looks on the display.  Its definitely much duller, but I still like it.  It fits my phone very well, and the part that clips it to the phone is very strong (I've had problems with those parts breaking off the case in the past).

Does the job and it's very stylish.,"Okay, I am not a teenager, or a 20, 30 or even 40 something....but I do love cute things and this cover just took my plain white android phone to a newer, happier level!
You can't beat the price either!  I would recommend these products to everybody.  At this great price, you can afford to get a few to change the look of your phone....I love the feel of it too, it isn't sticky feeling like most, or hard metal feeling like some, but a smooth yet subtle finish that is the best of both worlds.",It broke way too easy when trying to put a sd card in the phone....however the colors are nice just be prepared for heartbreak when the cheap plastic breaks.,"nice and cute case, offers minimal protection, just more for looks than anything. not very durable and breaks easy, would recommend if just wanting a cute look for your phone, packaged well, decent price considering and excellent shipping time thank you","I really like this cute little cover but the paint seems to be wearing.  For the price its a great deal since it is sturdy and protects the phone.  I did buy 2 so when the paint completely comes off, I can use the other.","I bought this for my daughter's phone cause she really liked the owl design.

It's not a hot pink though, more of a very light pink.  But it's still pink. :0)",Very flimsy.  Not worth the buy.  Spend the money to get an Otter box.  In my opinion it was not worth the cheap price for litttle to no protection.,The slots on the right side of the cover were not cut out to access my phone.  I cut them out my self.,When I get new phones I can never find cases right away. This one is great for initial use. It pulls out your hair and stretches eventually but for a few bucks I can't complain.,"When I first got the case it was great, but it started stretching and eventually I had to through it away because it didn't fit anymore. It sucked because I was really looking forward to the case; however, it didn't work out.","I was really glad to find an inexpensive case for my RAZR M.

I maybe would like it just a tad harder so it would not slip off the side kind of. But really not bad. Easy to hold and sticks where you put it, doesn't slide around. Easy to push buttons, so if harder material it might make that harder to do. I paid $0.31 so it's great for that price. lol  But I would still get it again, at that price maybe I should have gotten more. Maybe they could put in a 5 pack of different colors so you could change out colors with your outfits. lol I'd definitely buy again.",This item was a good price.  It is an exact fit & the color is easy to find in my purse.  It arrived quickly too!,"the case fits the phone well and offers a nice grip, but is softer then would be expected and the color is a different shade of pink than advertised.","Overall the reviews are mixed with most people enjoying the case. Some users comment about the color not being correct, but overall most users enjoy the fit and grip the case provides.","The case was not the same color as depicted in the image, it shows Hot Pink but is more lighter than the image displays. The case fits over the phone but the material used in this case is very flimsy. I did not like how the case is not snugged to the phone, it has wiggle room which makes me believe that the phone will fall out of the case or cover some of the screen which causes problems with some phone sensors. The price for this case was not worth it for what you get. Unless you can find this case for a discount price. Otherwise you should look for other cases that will fit your phone better.",

I have small arms, so like many other users, I found that the band didn't fit. I was able to make it work by looping the band through the plastic fastener, and then wrapping the band around itself before fastening the Velcro.  It's a little awkward to get it on, but once fastened it holds tight and does not come loose while in use. This says it is for the iPhone 5, but I am using mine with an iPhone 4S (and it fits fine, even with my small case on it).","put it on as soon as i recieved it, but it doesnt work. it is velcro and only has a little bit of velcro at the end. so you have to be the exact size as the armband to wear it. doesnt work at all for me, because my arm is too small.

I bent the front cover to make it as a stand when I laid the phone on a table to watch a show on the phone; then bent it back when I am done. The front cover does not break.

It does not add weight to the phone. Delivered in 20 days. these flip covers do not protect the phone much, bcoz when the phone would fall, it would just flip open and the front screen might crack!. but i just bought it bcoz they look cool ! :) and i dint wanna put 40 bucks for the original case because it does not serve the actual purpose of a phone cover (that is to save the phone incase it drops or something). you cant even take pictures if you completely flip the front cover behind.. because it would cover the camera!!! so buy this cheap one for now and keep looking if something better comes up for our amazingly awesome Galaxy Note II :)","This cover looks and fits like an official Samsung flip cover but it is missing the metal contacts that make functions like the S Beam, S Pen and NFC work.","This case fits the T-Mobile Galaxy Note 2 perfectly. Right now T-Mobile only has the charcoal grey covers. I wanted something different and this is a great case. It's cream white, not snow white, so it looks a little higher quality. Very pleased with it.","This item is exactly what was described A original Samsung case. For only 3$ the same case was listed for. 35 $ at my cell phone carrier store.

B009XL4J4U,I put it in my toaster oven and it turned into a pile of blue good.  Now my Eggo waffles taste like petroleum.  Great.,"Listen to the other reviews--one corner of the case doesn't fit.  It is a bit irritating if you are particular about those sorts of things.  I didn't bother returning it because it still stays on the case, but I play with the loose corner like I used to play with the hinge of my flip phone.","The first phone case I received was completely wrong.  I contacted the company and after giving them the identifying numbers off the plastic wrap - not the shipping receipt that everyone would keep (thank goodness I kept it, because I almost tossed it as soon as the case was out) they sent me the correct item at no additional cost.  The shipping times were 2-3 days longer than I have waited for similar items in the past, but the case is great.","Case arrived quickly, but it doesn't fit on my XT926- it doesn't wrap around one corner securely.

Again don't buy it,"I got this case about a month ago and it's been holding up really well.  I've dropped my phone a few times and it's definitely cushioned the fall!  A few people commented that one of the corners doesn't fit well and I do see a similar issue.  However, it covers it enough to 1) not let the case fall off and 2) still protect the oh-so-fragile corners of the phone. I actually don't even really  notice it anymore.  The case is also very sleek and stylish and doesn't add bulk at all.  Since the phone is so thin to begin with, this was key for me when trying to find a nice case!  And clearly, you can't beat this price.",Does not fit my phone properly the cores don't stay on ...if he fit right it would be a nice case,Shipped very quick and fits well.  The slim part located at the charger opening tends to slip off.  Nice that is comes in different colors though.,Great durable case. This product comes in many colors and is made to be durable and last. It does not scratch easily.,"Product was received in just a couple days after ordering!
Love the texture and sleek design of this phone cover",The corners of the case do not fit around the phone. But its a good buy for protection of the phone.,"Slim, not bulky, awesome grip....easy to hold. Great product for just a few dollars. Wish the face lip was thicker/stronger though.",I would buy another one of these covers even if it was triple the price. Looks nice and is non slip.,"The top left corner keeps sliding off!!!
Very frustrating.  This is the 2nd cover I've ordered for this phoine. I wish they could get it right!",the case does not fit your phone but it is a durable case.,The summary of the review of the phones case with blue in color and durability of 2 weeks with plastic wraps but it didnot fit comfortably . Price is too high,In general people say that the price is a good deal.  Most reviews express that the corners of the case do not fit right and have a tendency to come off.,
B009Y39ORY,"It's a piece of s***, & didn't even work. Huge waste of money. I don't recommend anyone buy this product.","It's pretty cool only few things I don't like; don't sync to music, lights up randomly, and the light up port it a little to big.",This case actually has a piece that allows it to light up. Such a fun case. I like to use it at concerts :),"lights do not move, they flash. this is a still picture that lights up. add over sells the product extremely","This case doesnt provide much in the way of protection as it is just a thin plastic cover. It is mostly a cool case to look at, I recieved a lot of comments on the case while using it, but it is not very functional being that the light for the case has to plug into the charger port on the phone. It has a small cord that can be plugged into the light piece to charge the phone but it seems to take a long time to charge the phone this way and the light made my phone die somewhat quickly. I found myself unplugging the light bar to charge my phone and this resulted in me losing the light. So this is a fun colorful case to use on occasion but it is not very good for long term use or protection.",Does not light up like it shows it does,"I received it in a timely manner but some of the lights do not work on it. Also, the charger was so cheap that it broke within a few weeks. Should not have bought it",not really what i expected! it only lights up when u turn it on i thought it would light up when i would get a call or a text? other than that its kinda pretty when its doing its thing!!,Bright light up its good had plenty of people comment on it that's an awesome case must have but the flaw about it kinda take up the battery the only thing,this is a fun concept that actually works- my kids love it as well as me. just becareful not to lose the base piece.,"it goes off even when there is no call or text, not worth it really consider another light up device",I love the phone case looking for a lot ore products like this ..There good price and great as gifts,It doesn't light up it is just a case. It's garbage and I will never order from this company again. It's a rip off completely!!!,I so love this case. Everyone who has seen this always asks me where I got it. Slow shipping. NEeds to charge more.uses battery.,"well im impressed with the fact it comes with everything it says it does, the description is thorough and accurate. the only thing i am in concern about is what battery does it take or how to replace it . but overall its a decent product. very popular with the family since they like light up things",an interesting phone case that lights up with response to the sound but it takes up the battery. a good product for the money and looks attractive.,i love the case. it is as advertised. and it lights up. it is cheaply made but colorful. you get what you pay for.,"The case does light up but only when turned on, not for example an incoming call.  The lights drain the phone battery quickly and the case is not as carefully constructed as some customers expected.",
B009YC0W3K,Beautiful quality! Really looks classy and modern. Love th case. Get a lot of compliments because of the way it looks.,"Case arrived in nice package and on time. But, a piece of it broke off when trying to put my phone in it!  Also, I will probably have to break it even more to get my phone out of it!!  If you can get your phone into it without it breaking, I think you will enjoy it until you try to take it out!","I took a gamble on this case.  I'm a sucker for bamboo related things.  Fortunately, the texture of the bamboo was great: a satin and smooth finish.  The colour thankfully wasn't actually as saturated as the product image indicated.  It's a dull walnut colour, personally that's a good look.  The bamboo is a little thick, as is the felt backing.  Unfortunately, there's no felt on the sides.

So for a first impression, the case is really good.  Despite the extra thickness, the overall size is very comfortable to hold.

Dimensions (roughly, couldn't find a caliper)

height: 127 mm
width: 63.5 mm
depth: 11 mm (iPhone5 is 7.6mm thick)",Total and absolute crap. If you drop your phone one time this cover will break as mine did. I dropped mine on a soft carpeted floor and the cover broke in half.,Poor quality. Looks great. But if u let it fall it will crack on you. I enjoyed this case all of 2 days before I got rid of it.,Nice case but cracked within a week due to design flaws. I don't recommend buying it--I'd read other reviews hoping mine wouldn't crack but it did within 3 days.,"Loved the way this looked and felt, even the way it smelled out of the box. Only complaint, is that they do break easily. But at the price, it's not a huge deal. Though, the second one I purchased was delivered broken, but with a case like this, wood glue works.","This case arrived and I was really happy with it at first glance. Then I realized it wasn't real wood it was some sort of vaneer. I still wasn't too upset it only cost around $10. But then I dropped my phone. Not from a large distance either, around two feet onto a hardwood floor. The whole corner of the case cracked and fell apart. Then I was really unhappy. I suggest buying a more expensive REAL wood case.",It is not as durable so if you drop your phone alot this is not the case for you. Otherwise it looks nice,"Really nice finish, didn't ship direct to Australia, hower used a 3rd party
Like the idea of wood, rather than plastic
Unfortunately split on first drop, right on top corner, but should be able to clear fill it","I had purchased mine and in a little over 2 weeks it started to fall apart. I am not at all rough with my phone, so if someone were to carry their phone in a bag... I'd guess it wouldn't have lasted a week!","Love the natural feel of wood over technology, however, the picture was deceptive -it came unvarnished, almost indistinguishable wood grain(even after I varnish it myself) and is already broken, despite the fact that I am very careful with my things- do to how thin and super lightweight it was. Sure would love one that look like the picture and actually withstood normal use like -taking it in and out of your purse and putting it onto your desk or bedside to plug-in","It is a beautiful case, good fit, functional. I have dropped the phone a couple times and the phone was undamaged. The case did it's job. One of the drops did result in a half inch chunk of wood coming off the case just above the camera. It is the thinnest, most fragile part of the case, so if it was going to break somewhere, it would most likely be there. It doesn't matter, the case did it's job! I can buy a dozen of them for what it would cost to repair or replace my phone.","I changed phones, so I never put it on my phone... My Cousin tells me she gets complements whenever she use her phone.","I have bought several of the wooden cases and this one is by far the prettiest. I dropped it once and it cracked, but it did protect my phone so I think it was worth the money. You just have to be careful with it.","Overall the reviews are mixed, with most users enjoying the look and feel of the case with some users noting they had broken parts or issues. Users note the case is very pretty, but can crack easily.",the case can be hit or miss. the quality is low end. the wood is dull looking. it likely won't last in the long term.,Most people are satisfied with this phone case but they also agree it is not as durable as others.  It will break if dropped so its best to do your best not to drop it as it may also damage your phone.,
B00A6SNTW2,A fun read at the end of a long day when I need a distraction but not the best thing I have ever read.,"I enjoyed all four of these short stories, it was some very erotic and enjoyable reading for the holiday season. Great value for the 99 cents, so I would recommend.","I very much enjoyed reading Holiday Spice. Of course, I'm a real sucker for a holiday story anyway but this one was exceptional. A very good read.","I should have guessed by the title that it was pure filth.  If you're into erotica, this one's for you.  I read the first installment and prompty deleted from my Kindle.","I don't know what else to expect from short stories. They are more like a summary of a longer book. But, it helped me pass some time.","I loved these short stories. It was a treat to get to read a bit of different stories and not be involved in one long one with the same characters...a nice change and the writers did a great job.
~Dee Madore~","If you are looking for a quick romantic read with a few tantalizing tales, this is a good book to pick up. What a better way to spend the holidays than to sit by a cozy fire and read something hot and spicy.

You will enjoy these four short stories, each one with a different female lead. I enjoyed the third story the most, Simon's Letter because it was fun trying to guess who was Elizabeth's secret admirer.","I downloaded this for free, otherwise I would not have picked it. The stories were short, and very formulaic. The emotion and intention were good, however.","You know how you'll sit through a bad movie thinking the ending wil make it better?...  I was hopeful on this too and realized it was never going to get better.  These stories are like the teeny stories my friends and I would entertain ourselves with in 7th grade... only not rated for young audiences.  Sorry, Abbie.",not much to these in the way of substance or length but they helped me to fall asleep a couple of nights as I like to read a bit before bed.,"Too short to develop characters, plot, backstory, etc .  The stories are easy to read though, and fairly enjoyable.  Good choice for a quick 30minute read.",Stories were decent and extremely short. I would have preferred two longer stories to four extremely short stories. Didn't notice any spelling issues just didn't like the brevity.,"A short but satisfying collection of four romantic stories with holidays themes. Female protagonists in these stories are either meeting new flames or getting reacquainted with old ones, in rather steamy way.

My favorite story was 'Rekindling the Fire'. Middle-aged couple, that lost the spark, so to speak, is stranded in the
mountain cabin by heavy snow, and while waiting for the rescue, they  rediscover their passion for each other.

Prose is simple yet tasteful. Love making is described in a sinfully polite way :)

Four sensual stories, just in time for the Holidays. Recommended.",Who doesn't love a good romance?  I know I do.  These short stories were just the right length.  Each of the four stories entertained me thoroughly and left me with a smile on my face.  I was waiting in the doctors office for about 10 minutes and found this book.  The other patients must have thought I was a little strange there staring and smiling at my phone.  But I guess in today's day and age that's pretty standard.  Loved it and recommend :),Was pretty average reading but I wasn't expecting too much. The description was fair and the price low so can't complain :O),"the product is a romance novel with some sexual content. many readers found it enjoyable, but nothing special. the sexual content turned off several of the readers.","Short stories and well-crafted prose in an erotic tale mixed with a sense of romance, simple to read and that caters to all audiences with a taste for mixed emotions.","these short stories provide entertaining erotic and romantic content to readers at a good value. while not long or detailed enough to develop plot or attachment to characters, the holiday stories serve as a decent read, especially considering the low price.",2 disagreements

To much of a hassle to send back!,"The paint on the case was already wearing off when I took it out of the package.  The case itself is durable, but the paint doesn't last too long.",This is a very pretty cover and the flowers are in 3d images u cant tell that from the photo posted on here. Give it a thumbs up.,Product met my expectations and very good for the money/ value. Would recommend to others. Thought it was more blue than purple.,"Its really pretty, fits tight, but its hard to take off the phone once its on, also the hole isn't wide enough for my headphone adapter so I got tired of taking it off all the time and leave it off permanently now unless I'm going somewhere.",I got it and tried it on my moms phone and it didn't fit. So It doesn't work. Sorry. Bye,"The case looked nothing like the online picture!!! Very disappointed , the picture online looked better than the actual case in person!",This case fits my phone perfect it snaps together and covers the phone great.  It's snug and non slippy.  The design gets me many compliments.,fits perfect and really durable! def. will need to get more so i have a variety. excellent and shipped faster than expected,"I loved the case, but had to return it ... My phone is a lgls860 so the case was to large - I have mailed it back and would like to exchange it if possible",The design is nice but however the material is really cheap and breaks easy. I still suggest this item to cover and protect the phone as it does the job.,I like this phone cover and the design thats on it. It fits good and all my friends like it. I like how derable it is.,I like the pattern. But the case itself did not fit. I could not even get the case onto my phone so I returned it and would like a full refund.,Case did not fit my Att LG optimus. It was too small. Waist of money don't buy if you have an ATT phone,Pretty color. Like the design. But not really what i thought it would be. Something i'll use but don't really like.,"The design and color of the case is appealing. The fit varies and is not reliable. If the fit matches, it is likely to get you compliments from others.","it's cheap, has a good design, but it can have size differences and the paint comes off easily.",The image and design is great for this price but there is issue with compatibility with some phones as it might not fit properly.,
B00AEEEUMQ,"I recently got my Samsung Galaxy s3 a couple of months ago. I love the phone, however I wanted an option to use a keyboard instead of the touchscreen so I immediately jumped at this sliding keyboard when I seen it. The keyboard looks pretty much like the photo...BUT the manufacturers accidentally printed an additional 'P' on the key that serves as the 'Delete' button. It took me a few minutes to figure that out! Overall, the keyboard is ok. If it would've been more than the cost that is listed, I probably would've sent it back. The option I like the most about the keyboard is the tilting screen. Other reviews mention how loud the keys are when typing, but in all honesty...it's not that bad. Sounds about the same as if you were typing on a laptop. One other note: phone cases will NOT fit on this keyboard...it is a little wider than the phone itself. I will probably keep this sliding keyboard.","The good:
Comes in nice packaging and even included a USB cable to charge it.

The phone fits into a rubberized case, that case easily slides and attaches onto the keyboard.
Detaching the phone from the keyboard is fairly simple so if you need to put the phone into a car dock or desk dock that should be as simple as sliding the phone off the keyboard.

The phone case is flat on the back it might not fit in some docks.  It still fits in my i-bolt car dock ok.

Pairing was simple, just follow the included instructions.

There are some holes in the keyboard to allow the sound from the rear speaker to get out, the volume seems the same with or without the keyboard attached.

The bad:
The whole unit with phone is about 7/8"" thick, with a better design it could be much thinner.

If you slide the keyboard down, it still blocks the camera just a tiny bit.
Either tilt the keyboard 90 degrees or just detach the keyboard when taking pictures/videos.",Love this case..... But the clasp where the case comes apart broke.  I glued it together I guess we'll see if it works.  If it does then I will up my rating.,"DO NOT BUY!!!! This product was broken before I even got a chance to try it! So I can't speak to its functionality, if you happen to get a working one.",Bought the wife Galaxy III (which does not have an external keyboard) becuase she wanted to retain an ext. keyboard function.  She loves this keyboard.  It attaches as advertised and works great for her.  I would recommend it.,"I love touchscreen, but sometimes I miss buttons. This product is PERFECT but it makes the phone SO FAT. I love it...but it's just so big. It makes the S3 literally an inch thick. Overall it is a really good product, but it just needs to loose some un-needed thickness.","not very useful. don't even use it anymore.
the screen doesn't rotate to face the keyboard. Or at list i couldn't do it.",It is good I love it the best one I ever seen some of my others packages have got yet can't,number keys are not separate.  Kind of kills the point of having a keyboard.,The description states it is thin and light but is quite the opposite. Very heavy and made the phone twice as big. Couldn't get in or out of my pocket very well and I wear loose fitting mens jeans. Also when you type the buttons are very loud so everyone around you can hear that you're typing. This isn't a big deal if you're not trying to be quiet. Overall I would not purchase this product again and I returned the one I bought. The only good thing was how easy Amazons returns and refunds are. Love them!,"I did not want to believe the other reviews and decided to order it anyways.  I WAS VERY DISPLEASED with the quality of the keyboard. Not only did the shift key not work properly, the backlight was very dim and it was difficult to see the letters on the keyboard.  The keys are made of a hard plastic which makes it difficult to push down and LOUD while typing.
Unfortunately, I used the keyboard for less than 3 hours and sent it back.  VERY displeased.

Heed all the warning and resist the purchase of this item.",I recived the case brand new shiped very fast love the case works very well. takes a little while to get use to the keyboard but is a really great case. you can turn the phone on amd off by the case. it also has alot of other great features,I found the cover a little bulky.  But it did work. I ended up buying a different one that was a lot lighter.,I got thre case in the mail put it on my phone to use for about 2 hour. at night i went to charge it and the female charger was pushed to far down in case. i cant charge it. waste of money.,phone is heated too much and the quality is zero percent plastic itself underground to break into pieces because of overheating. otherwise looks preeliko and not convenient for carrying,this is a large case with keyboard. it can feel a bit heavy. the keyboard functions well and the keys are not too loud. the case allows you to power off. it is packaged well and comes with charging cord.,"the phone keyboard is simple to use and makes typing easy, but the keys are louder than using the on screen keyboard and it makes the phone much thicker.",An attachable keyboard for the Samsung Galaxy s3 and similar models. Slides on the phone for another way to type. Has an attachable USB cable for charging. All you need to do is pair the keyboard to the phone before use.,

I never got it so its a complete waste of money! This was super disappointing!,"I really wanted to like this product but ended up being disappointed.

On the bright side, my product was shipped extremely quickly, arriving within a mere eight days.

Unfortunately, the cat itself is not at all as pictured. It's a glossy gray all over without the cat in the picture's cute stripes. Moreover, the face is different and the body is slightly dented. Overall, the product is not as high quality or cute as the one in the picture.

My guess is they ran out of the original cat charm and shipped this instead. Perhaps others will receive the proper product but I was disappointed. Nonetheless, it was very cheap so I won't complain about wasting money. I only wish I could find that adorable cat charm!","This product still hasn't reached my doorstep and I ordered it on April 6th and its now June 10th. But this product looks so cute, I really hope its worth the wait.",This is ovbiously a novelty purchase but I expected it to last longer than 2 days. The thin plastic piece that goes in to the earphone jack broke off from the cat piece on the second day that I had it. I contacted the seller and was quickly sent a replacement (with some additional pieces) and the second one broke quicker than the first.,Oh my gosh my dad let me order this for my sister in December and its June still haven't got it soooo mad,This is very adorable. The colors are a bit darker than the picture though but that doesn't really matter to me. It fits with thin cases. I bought a thin glow in the dark case JUST for this piece. It is a tiny bit above the case but you can't really notice it. It is very adorable and cute. Some people said in either this products review or the other sellers review that it broke right away. It didn't for me! I checked the piece to see if it was unsturdy and it was perfectly fine. If you are looking for a cute Anti dust earphone jack this is the one to buy!,"This was bought as a gift, and the recipient is overjoyed to have it. Not only is it cute, it's functional, too!","this cat charm is very cute decoration for your phone. however, it seems to have problems with shipping and delivery, sometimes never showing up at all.",the dust plug was painted pretty. it goes well with thin cases. it is cheap and brittle and should last longer.,cute and functional charm which can take a while to ship. plastic piece that goes into headphone jack can break easily because of the cheap plastic.,

She agrees to do anything he wants for his birthday and what he wants is to spank her butt a nice shade of red and then 'do her' hard. Enough said.

This was an extreamly quick read, straight to the point. Average light bondage/ spanking scene.
Was a freebie from Amazon.com so can't complain. Overall it was ok just really short so I can't honestly give more than 2 stars. To me this was like a taste test a little sample of a story or just a quick fantasy.

B00ALAVS46,"The very beginning was a little flowery in description which tempted me to quit right there.  I read on in the sample and bought the book.  This has fascinating characters, a wide range of kinds of people and creatures, and lots of action with a little mystery coupled with some romance.  The ending is nicely done so that the tale is wrapped up but there is room for more books with the same characters.  I will read any future books in this series.","I liked the premise of the book and the world it was set in.  However, the main character, Mistral, was very unlikeable. She was rash beyond reason, crazy moody and would have temper tantrums. She didn't even care about the people who raised her.  When she found out her adopted mother had died, even though her adoptive parents were really good to her, she didn't care.  Then she met some guy and after several days, it seemed as if she became a totally different person (though her brat-like qualities were still consistent).  I read the whole book hoping my view of her would change because I liked some of the supporting characters and the plot ideas but when the book ended I knew I would not be reading the sequel.  If Mistrel had been tweaked in varying situations to make her more likeable and less volatile, I think I would have liked the book.  Yet, as it stands, I would not recommend it.","Starts off great. Crazy, brave, awesome woman warrior takes on monsters and evil and survives with the help of her warrior brothers.  Then she turns into a weak, sniveling, whiny baby when she...falls in love?  I find it unrealistic that such a tough and fearless girl could change so much...and even if she could, why does she let the guy dictate to her that she must persue the sight?  He keeps telling her to be who and what she wants, which is a warrior, not a seer, but she keeps giving in and lets everyone around her force her to be a seer. Stupid and unbelievable  at best","This book had an interesting story with a longer coming of age plot line than I expected, but still managed to pull it off. My only possible issues were with the main character who I had trouble relating to until a good way into the book, and speed with which the story developed. Either way I would still recommend anyone in this genre to read it as the story ok and the price is not to bad either.","The problem is the main character and the emotional wreckage she is.  Way too much time spend on this and not enough on action.  Most characters are well done except the main.  Hunts are too short and lack punch, only to see the character fall back on her mental state asap","This is the first of four or more books.  I enjoyed reading it, but could not get interested in the sequel though I tried several times.  This rough and tumble gal becomes a love struck puppy at the end and never gets over it.","I had a hard time reading through the book due to the inconsistencies on Mistral's experience. On one hand we hear how she is such a great hunter and as any hunter knows is patience and that is one thing she doesn't seem to have. The book is peppered with a lot of whining and temper tantrums thrown in with how inexperienced she is in her role. If I didn't know she was supposed to be older, I would assume she was all of 5 with how her character seemed to evolve. It does get a 3 though for the vivid descriptions of the surroundings. If a second book came out, I know I won't be buying it considering I have to keep skipping over so much of irritations in this book.","the first few paragraphs were hard to read due to punctuation errors, and I never complain about that; but it sets the tone of the book. Right after her adopted parents loving discussion about her future, said child is cold and unfeeling towards them. this theme is repeated, as the teenager refers to her home as a prison and never considers the love they gave her.  As another reviewer said the heroine is a real turnoff.  I also had problems with the collage dorm attitude that the training camp had. all party at the bar after working out all day, sophomore jealousy.  I am barely into this book and just can't force myself to read more.  The plot, if there is one, lost in the endless descriptions of daily life.  If author was trying to recreate a Harry Potter type of interesting school grounds, he or she failed big time.  So tired of the teenager that can do it all.
again, this was a kindle unlimited book and free,  thank goodness!","I had enough after I read about half of the book. The story simply was not really interesting and neither were characters.
In the end I just didn't care what happens next. I personally felt reading any further would just be a waste of my free time.

The characters don't seem to have any depth, and it's really hard to find the main character likable. She is stubborn and thoughtless, and quite often acts like a spoiled brat. She often gets angry when someone reasons with her, and actually doesn't seem to display any other emotions.

Until of course she get's in love. The love interest thread of the main character seems to me to have been just bluntly inserted like something off a checklist, and the relation further seems incredibly out of character, and incredibly unnatural.

Overall, I don't think will be waiting for any other works in this series.","can't wait for the next one. i love all the characters, exept maybe Fabian. its well written and awesome in all ways!!!","too simple characters with little development and a very vague world building.

The main character is also social stupid (if not all-around plain dumb), especially considering she can read (and understand) all feelings in others. It also feels off how the main character turns from unfeeling to obsessed in no time and with a deus ex machina reason.",Interesting story that kept you wondering what would happen next.  The overall sappy love drama was deffinately overplayed and quickly became boring.,"Couldn't connect with the characters, didn't like the main character at all, she is rude, childish and self centered, prone to tantrums and anger displays, it was difficult to read about something you don't like, won't make the same mistake again.
Wouldn't recommend.","I do wish all the errors would be edited out. BTW, wolverines are big, nasty, weasels and are not related in any way to wolves.","Glad I bought the first book before seeing the negative comments. I have really enjoyed this series of books. I'll grant that the main character is brash and offensive but that is the point. Her name is Mistral which essentially means a harsh wind. She is stormy, willful and undisciplined, entirely ruled by her emotions. The series is about her growth. I like the characters and appreciate the world Ms. Jones has created. Fun experience. If it gives an idea of how much i've liked it, I got the fifth book thru KindleUnlimited ($9.95 a month for unlimited qualifying books) but ended up buying it after I read it so I could add it to my permanent library.","the book has a vast world, with a diverse cast of secondary characters and a nice premise, but the main character is unrelatable and harsh, which makes it annoying to read.",This mythical book is fun to read. It was plot wise well written but punctuation and mythical facts are little off otherwise a great book.,this is a fantasy novel where the main character mistral is a warrior.  the story focuses more on her love life and her emotions surrounding it.  most people seem to think that mistral is emotionally immature.,
B00AMRSNTQ,The cover comes off all the time while in pocket . Clearly its not a good fit. Wouldn't refer it at any price.,Cell phone case falls off too much. Wasn't what I expected. Did help my phone when I dropped it though,"Thought it was a hard case I misread, no worries though he loves and thankfully we haven't had anymore accidents...so far.","Case fits really loose, I do not see how it would protect your phone. You can literally squeeze the phone out of the case without much effort. No stiffness, sort of like it's made of a worn our rubberband. I will be returning this case. I'm not sure how it was rated this high being such an inferior product.","i like the case, but it doesn't fit snug like i expected it would.  still love it tho & using it","Using this as a backup for the otter box and it is very nice, smooth and fits as hoped. I would buy again.",I would highly recommend this to anyone. Great purchase choice. This item will aid in the protection of your mobile device.,It was good and easy to use. Came off a little more then I wanted. Bit did the trick .,"I am just giving it 3 stars because the quality is not that great, and I don't think my phone will survive if i drop it","Our model of this case did not fit the Droid DNA well. It came off several times. In the end, we bought a case from Verizon.

Apart from that, the design is good.","This case easily falls off phone. Its bad enough that just by picking up the phone you have to put the case back on to even use it.
also the buttons are hard to find in the dark.",Seemed stretched out didn't stay on to well. Kept falling off and would collect dirt behind the case. Hard to use in a pocket,"When buying a case for my phone, I would like it to fit snug with no gaps.
I do like the ease of pressing the buttons though.
I do not use it.","Good material quality, however, it does not fit. I used a heat gun to shrink it so it can snug but still comes off.",the case does not fit the phone correctly. it keeps falling off and getting snagged when I put it in my pocket.  it might be fine for those who do not put their phones in pants pockets.,"the case doesnot fit the phone perfectly and it is very loose , it dosent need effort to remove it","According to the review, this product was good and easy to use. But, some time the case doesn't fit to the phone correctly. Overall its worth to buy.","a cover that doesn't fit properly most of the time, but the quality is good overall.",
B00ARZIOE2,Unimpressive.  No depth to story.  It was entirely predictable...where was the suspense...the hook?  ks.  Not worth time or money...she needs to build better story line.,"I don't write book reviews unless I feel a book is an exceptional read.  This one, unfortunately, is exceptionally bad.  Of the hundreds of books I have read over the past few years, this is the most poorly written one of them all.  I am rather surprised the publisher would actually print such an inferior story.  I read the entire book in about 30 minuted, and I'm not a fast reader.  The sequel, ""Come back, Blizzard Bride"", is equally as bad.","This book is extremely short and while a clever story line, hardly  time to get interested before this mini novel ends.","Not only was this story incredibly silly, it was book-wise, about 4 pages long.  I think it was written by an 8 year old.",Didn't know when I purchased this book that it was a short story. I guess there's a follow up for more of the book but didn't know it when I bought it. Story was okay but didn't interest me enough to buy more.,It was a nice story and I like westerns. The characters were believable. Things we see are not always the truth.,"The book was very good I like this type of romance stories. It appealed to the side of me that wants a
man to act like a gentelman","This book was too short, too shallow and predictible. Vocabulary was not faithful to the time and place in the story.",Well written. Great love story. It is just like the title says a Sweet Western Romance. I highly recommend this book.,Good escape reading but it left me wanting more depth of character and plot.  I'd reread it if I needed a quick read.,I feel it caught my attention almost from the start.  I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it.,"I can't wait to read the rest this was a very sweet, very a enjoyable. Easy to read too. Yay","Because it was a novela instead of a full length novel, it was a quick read - I think I finished under the hour. Something to read on a trip, waiting in an airport or on the train.","This is a short story, not a book.  I would say it is a rough draft of a story for a book.  It's a fast read with not much development of characters or story.  Could have been a good a book.",not much of a story and plot needed help.  read it a week ago and have already forgotten what the story was  about.,The story was short. It was a romance western. It was great for a beginner reader.,A very short story of love with good passion  but it needed some depth in characters and the story to be a novel. Good read for short story lovers but it's not for novel readers.,it's a short dramatic story for a quick read. good for reading on a plane or taxi.,2 disagreements
B00AT1GM3E,I love Theresa and I love her show but this book was quite disappointing. I felt like I was watching an episode of her show. Even though the book was inexpensive it was not worth it.,Would have liked a little more info about her abilities . I believe they could have made it all into one book. This seems like just a chapter of her info about herself that led nowhere. Kind of dissapointed . Should have bought a different book with more detail into her life.,Wish I had read the reviews first. This is just a synopsis of the TV show with a few facts about Teresa's life.,"Not a real book.  Just a few pages of  already known information without details.
You can read the while thing in 15 minutes.",I just felt like I was reading someone's essay or book report . It was too short and didn't have any of Theresa Caputo's personality or humor highlighted in it.  I was just kind of disappointed and it only took about 30 minutes to read!,Lookig for more stories of her ability. There are other mediumship books out there that I liked better. (2 more words),"She is so cute and honestly just out there to help others heal,her family is cute and can see their support.","Thoroughly enjoyed this book!  I love watching the show - I think her gift is absolutely amazing and she truly uses it to help people.  Reading this book helped me realize a lot of things that I've been sensing and how to deal with them.  the hair color is fake, but other than that, she's the real deal!!!",This book seems to have been written by a fan without any input from Caputo. I was disappointed. I was hoping for some words from Teresa herself or at least from someone who knows her.,I watch her all the time on TV and she's really good. She helps so many people get the closure they need,"I loved what the book had to say, but was disappointed it was more like an article, I was expectating a full length book..",This is a small kindle book about Medium Theresa Caputo and how she came to be a long island medium. It was ok but hoping to reading her bigger book soon so I can learn more about it. It was a great price only 3 dollars.,Waste of money. Didn't tell me anything I didn't know from the show.,"Not much new here- covered in the own book.  this is a waste of money, spend it on Theresa's book. .","This book was not very well written.  It did give some interesting facts about Theresa Caputo, but it would be much more interesting and entertaining if it was actually written by Ms. Caputo herself.","A little book about the medium Theresa Caputo. Most readers, although they profess to love Ms. Caputo, thought the book was too short and did not contain enough new material. Overall, readers would have preferred a more in-depth book about the subject, something that would complement what they see on Ms. Caputo’s TV show.","this is a very short book about theresa caputo, the tv medium.  there is not much substance here and can be read in about 15 minutes.  although it gives some insight into her family life, it is just not well done.",the book lacks some information with few details. the book is not written by mrs. caputo.,
B00ATJC2GM,"Good value for money as for the cost of a normal watch , one gets a cell.phone .","Works as designed, I have had no problems with the watch or phone to this point.","This is a pretty good item.

Very disappointed and my daughter too!!!,phone works good great sound best with blue tooth although the stylist broke 2 days after i received it other then that get what you pay for price was right ...,"I throught the item was made bettrer then It look's, the screen could be a little bigger then it is now. But I like the functions and the style the item.",Really good deal especially for me I'm in a wheel chair and it's right on my wrist.,The picture of the product is not what you actually receive. The picture also show a bluetooth headset but thats not included. Shipping is also very long but considering coming from china i guess i cant complain. I am actually disappointed with this product.

it is a nice BiG watch bulkly in size but it works well","This phone watch is awesome,  I would definately recommend buying it...the shipping was long but it was worth the wait my baby loves it...",It is nice to have handy. This watch is fun after I added attraction from bluetooth it handles good. Now I have movies on the go with music/phone/videos.,this watch seems to be a good value for the money deal.  some people have complained of the numbers and letters being too small to read.  others say they are happy with it while some say it broke quickly.,"This Product name: Watch. Most reviews gives positive comments...Good color, easy to handle, long battery life, fit with wrist, bluetooth facility good etc....Some review gives negative comments...I think this is combo of 2 watches someone's tells one is good, print pen size small cannot read text, low battery power, MP3 and bluetooth not working properly, delivery issues etc....Finally, this is good product.","The phone watch is unreliable and breaks easily after a short period of time. The price is good, but you will have to wait a long time for shipping. It looks like a better deal in the pictures than it really is.",
B00B04B0KY,More of an article that you might find in a local paper than a book. And a lean one at that. Save the dollar.,"I was expecting more information.  The pamphlet, on my Kindle, did not last very long into my flight. It was OK otherwise.","After reading this piece I can say that it is very well written and gives us a glimpse of what happened to these two ladies that night. The author paints a vivid picture of the tragedy and how it has affected him, and his response it. He writes with compassion and respect, which is sorely missed in many writings today.
I don't see why others are complaining about the length of this work it is after all, an essay and it states that fact in the description. This is very much worth a read. Some of these reviewers need to remember that the quality of a writing is much more important than the quantity of pages....","Good as it is, but I expected more in depth information and description than there was. But it was an ok read.","One of the girls who were killed that night, was Michele Koons She graduated from Kearny  High School, in San Diego, just as I did. Though I didn't
personally know her, news  spread quickly at school. The book is like a roller coaster ride. Starts slowly. And then the bears show up.  After that night, Park Rangers and their policy towards bears, changed  in a major way.. Up till then bears seemed to be viewed as the same as zoo animals
I highly recommend it.. I will never camp in a area that has bears. It's a Bear version of Jaws","Just as the author, I've always felt a connection to ""Night of the Grizzlies.""  I still have the original paperback, which I pulled out not long ago to read once more, coincidentally about the time I ran across the essay while searching for a kindle version of the book and something more current.  Although ""Night of the Grizzlies, 45 Years Later"" was interesting and I appreciated the author's personal connection to the victims and his journey to honor them, I would have liked more than just an essay with perhaps updated information about the victims, families, etc. with photos.",A bit brief but we'll written. Loved the original story. It has stayed with me and took me to Glacier in every page.,"To say this is a very poorly written piece hardly describes it adequately.  It reminds me of poorly organized ""Letters to the Editor.""
It doesn't have anything to do with the original book, but borrows on the title.  I am sure the author tries to do good work in the interests of wildlife and grizzly bears in particular.  I wish he would confine himself to that good work and not visit pieces like this upon the reading public!",I probably would of liked it more if it wouldn't have quit less then half way thru it and I couldn't turn any more pages...never happened before with a book so I just returned it!!!!,"I purchased this account because of my familiarity with the subject matter, and an interest I have in the life of Bears. As the wife of a former Forest Ranger I have encountered
grizzlies in the wild, and watched as the public goes through seasons of wonder at the animals, and horror at the devistation they can inflict. This author has a first person
experience worth the reading of anyone who loves the bears, or has ever experienced the impact of these creatures in the wild. He speaks with passion, and the emotion of his respect
and love is evident as well as his honor for those who suffered the greatest at a time when man and nature were in conflict. In short, I love this account and it left me wanting to read MORE.","The is a follow up to the first book Night of the Grizzlies.  Easy read.  I enjoy knowing what happen to the people and the land.  If you ever consider living with bears, or just want to improve your knowledge of bears, these two are a must read",I was surprised this is really a 10 page booklet that doesn't give much in the way of new info. Mainly a brief reflection of two lost lives. I was hoping for more info on the condition of the bears health and what changes in park management occurred afterward.,This is not worth your time. It is little more than a personal journal entry.  Definitely take a pass on this one.,I thought this was supposed to be a book. It is more like a term paper which can be read in ten minutes.,"Not even worth 99 cents!  This is nothing more than an ""essay"" saying that the author feels a ""bond"" with the 2 victims.  The only ""new"" information is the authors short description of the attack scenes as they exist today.

This is not a full length book.  Most of this ""essay"" is about a animal rescue organization which the author belongs, and his opinions on the actions of Alaska wildlife officials.

This was my ""free"" book to borrow for my Kindle.  Thank goodness it was ""free""!",the book is well written and has an original story. however it is short and it lacks important information.,"though the story is great to read, it should have been more to this.","a short, well written essay about grizzlies in alaska from the viewpoint of an animal rescue organization.",

I make it a point to not read the extra chapter teaser at the end of books, because I don't like not having the whole story so I can read it.

My daughter in law is one of the authors on this with her first published book. Sent out to all my friends and family.,"This are teaser chapters to get you to buy the books. Have nothing against the authors, but I was expecting novellas not one chapter. Very disappointing.","I, too, was confused.  I thought it was a collection of short novellas for Valentine's Day.  I was disappointed.  But I will probably buy some of the books after reading the first chapter.  I just wish I had know before I started reading that these were not complete.","I must point out that this is a book of story snippets/ and coming attractions for books soon to be or already in print. It's not a full length novel. I fully admit skipping over the stories I do not really get into. I'm a fan of historical romance, and not really paranormal. But, if you like all romance genres, then you should check this book out to see if you would be willing to buy these full length stories once they come out.","a series of short romantic stories. do not expect a long read, this book is better for a plane ride or to pass time.",this is a collection of story snippets from several different authors.  through this book you will get to read several different authors and decide whether the full book is for you or not.  a great way to explore new authors without having to purchase the entire book.,It was stories from different authors about romance.

Need to buy the other volumes to find the true end.","a first book in a series that will continue to be released. a tale of an amish boy who deserts his amish lifestyle for the life of a biker. shorter than most books, this tale begins the plot that will be continued in future releases.",A compelling look into the Amish with a fictional tale. The serialized plot does get a bit annoyinh.,the book's plot doesn't have much depth and often there are many jumps which make the story confusing,
B00B84UZKW,This was a great short read! I really enjoyed it and wished I could read more about the characters. I recommend!,This book by Evie North was very good. I hope to read more of her books in the future. Good.,I couldn't stop reading this book. I read it all at once and will read the rest of the series.,Nice fast pace for a quick and short read. This is the book for anyone who's looking for a short and quick read.,"I got this free,so I have no problem with the book,if I would have paid full price,I would have been disappointed,but this was a quck sexy read,and it tried to be a romance book with somewhat of a story line,but basically it was just a quick sexy romp,it was an enjoyable read and had a loose story. If its still free grab it,tis worth the read,if it cost money I would not spend more than 99cents","This short story was to short for me. It was cute, but I thought it could have been something more.",This is a quick read. The story line was good but tended to wander.  The chemistry between the characters was hot and definitely won me over.,"It wasn't absolutely terrible, but it was much shorter and lacking a lot. I can't complain too much since it was free, but the characters were stock and the story was Velveeta on the cheese scale. Don't expect to get caught up in it, because the moment it starts, its over. There wasn't much content to the plot either. Expect it to be as cheesy as the cover.",I have read all the books in this series and have not been disappointed.  Also this is the first time I have read any of her books but I will continue looking for others in the future.,Short and sweet. Could have been a little longer. Romance was not as hot as it could have been. Good read either way.,"I have read some really great short stories / novellas lately.  This, unfortunately, is not one of them.

There is potential, and the author's writing is technically correct, but it could've been so much better.  This is a story that deserved to be told with depth, not as a quick drive-by.  The characters, a powerful knight, scarred both on the inside and the out as a youth by an evil uncle, and a lost gypsy looking for her ""family"" troup, are likeable.  The premise of her dislike for him is quite a stretch, however.  There needed to be more too it.  The ""night of passion....with the knight"" wasn't enough to carry this story on its own.

The ending is also very abrupt and leaves you thinking that the author hit her word limit.  Not the worst I've read, but not nearly good enough, either.",It was too predictable. Not enough back story. I love the romance but this was not for me. Two stars from me.,This was a good read. It takes less than half an hour but worth it. Two lost souls finding each other.,Was a good short read. I enjoyed it very much finished it quick. Would have liked it a little longer.,"This has the makings of a good story. I wish it had been a full novel. Not happy, it was too much of a teaser","most reviewers found this book to be a quick and enjoyable read. many finished it quickly and would have liked it to be a little longer, adding more backstory and depth. it is part of a series and the author has published other books, as well.",Overall a good book. Those who enjoy a shorter read will like it even more. This is just one of several in the series.,"Overall the reviews are positive with users noting it was a great and enjoyable story. Some users report the story was too short, but overall still an enjoyable read.",
B00BFSM7YS,A very short book can read in less than a day and just a follow on from her previous novel - could have included it in the main novel.,Good follow on for The Vintage Tea Cup club,"My fault! I didn't realize it was a short story but $2.75 for a 48 page snippet. Really!!
Don't bother.

A nice light read",This is a sequel to the Vintage teacup club. Bit of a let down. Just didn't quite have the sparkle of the previous book. It was a bit bland but for a short story it was ok.,Not as good as The Vintage Tea Cup Club but kept me reading.,Just a fun read that you don't have to think hard about.,The original book was a light read but the extra didn't develop in any great degree the characters or the plot. There was too much referral to the original. I didn't rate it highly.,I could go on and read these Teacup books forever and a day and never get sick of these lovely friends.,What can be better than a cup of tea and a good book.  Vanessa Greene tells a wonderful story of friendship and dreams.  It's well written and keeps your attention throughout the whole book.,"Again, a lovely light read. Getting to know more about the characters. Would have liked the book to continue for a lot more chapters, so hope there isanother in the series to come. Thank-you","Oh this could have been so much better but sadly was boring, predictable and lacked any depth. Shame as I enjoyed the vintage teacup club.  Not sure why this short prequel was really written? $$ ?",it was an easy enjoyable read. I liked the way it was written and the story line was easy to follow.,"as a follow-up to the vintage tea cup club, it's a quick and enjoyable read, but it feels like the ending comes too soon.","it is a short and fun book, and has good characters, but the story was not well developed.","A short book, and easy to understand. It does not require a lot of thought. This book is just a continuation of a previous book.",
B00BJ53ANY,"this was not what I anticipated, I was expecting maybe a western type story but needed
much more meat on its bones",Poorly written. Disappointing story focusing on just one family instead of looking at different aspects of the orphan train. I wanted to see more stories about other children.,A superb story that keeps you going to the last page..,This is a  book based exclusively on plot. There is very little to no character development. It would make a good beach summer reading.,"It started out pretty good . It had a good plot, and was down hill aaaaallllll the way!!!!!! Worst  author I have ever read !!!!!!!  dragged out!!",this is truly a tear jerker and quite gripping! I was messmarized by the change of scenes.  I recommed it!,"I bought this book thinking it was the best seller by the same title recommended to me by friends. I suffered through 22% and was so happy to discover I had the wrong book. It's poorly written, has underdeveloped, stereotypical characters and a boring story line.  Don't waste your time or money.",beautifully written. characters were fully developed the story plot was was focused for the reader at all times a part of our history that needs to be remembered,Story was good and kept you intrigued but the English spelling of some words was hard to understand at times.,"What a wonderful book, I just couldn't put it down. I found it so interesting, and I wept tears while reading  and so there was sadness and happiness  all in the book. I avidly read on to find out what happens next. A great book indeed.  I shall certainly read more from this author.","Lovely story while also highlighting the terrible poverty and trials these children and the Irish as well as other,immigrants experienced.",Good and engaging story.  It was poorly edited which was annoying.  Some areas were a bit choppy and hard to follow.  The ending laft questions.,"This is a great story but it is poorly written and edited. Incomplete sentences, improper grammar and misspellings abound. Find another author that tells the story better.",It is an interesting and complicated story.  The manuscript would have benefitted from more proofreading.,this book has a cast of wonderfully described characters who will keep your attention  riveted throughout the exciting events of the story.,"This story was not well written. Although the story manages to captivate the audience, the editing and writing style leave a bad impression on the reader.",a sad and gripping book about orphans and immigrants. interesting story but can be poorly written at parts.,"The story is pretty strong as a whole, but the writing itself can leave something to be desired at times. Sticking with it and finishing the book will be well worth the effort for readers",
B00BJRCM3Q,"Having lived in 5 countries over the last 13 years, with only brief returns to my ""home"" in the US, I enjoyed watching the author's metamorphosis from wide-eyed & somewhat arrogant American to a person with some understanding of other cultures. The book is easy to read, but I was bothered by the abundant malapropisms.","This book requires an editor who knows how to keep the storyline in sequence. This one, at times, seems arbitrary. That said, I recommend this book to any student studying abroad.","I love France. I love the French language. I have actually looked for peanut butter in Paris.

This is a autobiographical text by a very young woman who is enamoured with herself and her own experiences. This is a great thing when you are that young woman. It's not a great book necessarily. Ms. Sparks frequently comes off as smug and self-righteous. There are moments of quite lovely writing, following by pity parties, sad little paragraphs of filler that should have been edited out or rewritten and outright hubris.

Note that I read to the half way point in the book and deleted it off my iPad. Perhaps it got better and the author redeems herself at the end but I sincerely doubt it and as I have other things to read and I only paid $0.99 for the book, I considered it not a terrible loss and have moved on.",This was enjoyable and I found out about another perspective of Paris other than that of just being a tourist.,"The author complained, whined and longed for her home. Why travel? Dreadfully written. I do not recommend this book at all. Keep searching for something better.","I did enjoy reading this book.  It was like a travelogue, but along with seeing the places Kat visited and lived in, we get to see how her experiences changed her.  This book is educational, insightful, and entertaining.","This is a wonderful book.  The reader is taken on a vivid adventure.
The author is a keen observer as the reader finds in her poetic descriptions, her insight
into French attitudes and customs, and her sharing of language subtleties.  We look for her next book.
CS","This memoir was incredibly repetitive, as the emails between the chapters say exactly the same things as the chapters they come before and after, and the text itself was riddled with typos.",A whiny self serving young person who went to a foreign country to experience change and then complained that it wasn't like the U.S.A.,"Anyone who knows what it is to be home sick, or has experienced culture shock will appreciate this book! Happy reading!!!",I am German and this book will always be one of my favorites. It made me relive a part of my live traveling throughout Europe again.,Good read as a student my self I put my self in her shoes  and actually learned a lot from her  experiences.,I thought it was an honest depiction of her life in France. I have been to Paris and London and found her statements valid.,"The author takes you on an intimate journey, you feel like you're right there with her as you read her thoughts, it sucks you in with its beautiful and insightful prose. I now understand so much more about what it's like to live abroad!",I chose this book because peanut butter is oine of the staples in my food diet bit this is a slow read for me...not sure I enjoy reading this book but I WILL finish reading  it.  Next time I come across one of Kat's books I will scan more than the title.,"This book is very useful reading for anyone intending to live in a foreign country for an extended time,  The author describes in detail her experience and her emotions during the year away from her home in Kansas.",the general consensus is that people like this book as it follow the adventures of a young lady in europe.  there are some complaints about the author being too whiny and complaining about travel.,This book is a way of describing one's travels abroad and the immense experiences he has had through it. Also this book will be useful for students to learn about different cultural practices,
B00BLV5GPG,did not help me find any kind of passion..did not tell me anything I had not learned before - don't buy this.,"Other books have a habit of steering you this and that way before getting to the nut and bolts of what they are trying to say. This book is a quick easy read, that gets straight to the point. I would look no further for an amazing read, learning experience, and confidence builder.
So all in all,
I like the book!","Mostly a reinforcement of common advice.  A few gems of wisdom made it worth the quick read. Definitely won't break the bank, so if you're thinking about buying it, I'd recommend it.","This book is short and to the point, and very thought-provoking.  I recommend it for anyone thinking there must be something better in life.  Inspiring!","Good work that help to understand the life, and never give up, we have to listen our heart and remember everything.","This book is very short and to the point, however I believe it could be a little more detailed on the author's points about finding your passion. Never the less, it did have an impact on me while I was reading... it was a nice little reminder that you can and will achieve your goals/passion in life.",Very boring read and nothing more then common sense. Very kindergarten type advice that I wouldn't find helpful in any emotion or part of life.,"Not a long book, but exceptionally rich with solid advice. I'm looking forward to implementing the suggestions I found here to motivate myself to get working on a more satisfying life.",This book is easy to read and insightful. I really enjoyed it and I think it is a must read for everyone.,Loved this book. It really helped me out with the way I've been feeling lately. It was just what I needed to read.,Good pointers.. It was a good quick and easy read. Unlock your purpose-filled life and make the world a better place!!,"I found this book to be very encouraging, easy to understand and apply. I especially liked how the author takes the reader back into their own childhood to reflect on their own simple pleasures to discover what they were most passionate about as a child.",This book provides an excellent overview of how to discover your passions and the importance of pursuing them. I really enjoyed this and learned alot from it. I think everyone would benefit from reading this and even from reviewing it on a regular basis. We can all use a reminder of this concept from time to time.,Well written and a fast read. I needed just these words right now. Mannion writes wisely without the hype many authors use.,I was not very impressed with this book. He brought up a few good points and quotes but I did not find this book helpful,"It is very short, but written well. It is understandable and applicable for real life. Everyone must give it a try.","a short book that gets to the point without getting bogged down, and with life's worthwhile advice.","This book is short and simple with common but useful knowledge in it that is helpful and worth being reminded of even if it is not news to you. It's affordable and while it does not go into depth, it is easy to read and very accessible.",
B00BP0EZ3M,The storyline is OK but the language is rougher than I would prefer.  I have not finished it yet but I will -- unless it gets too crude  in language,"This book is written for ten yesr olds. I am appalled at the lack of cohesive plot, lack of real science (except for a ten year old) . Cartoon character aliens. Even calling the AI ""Hal"". The only character with potential is Shelley. Sorry, but truly a waste of time.",First an Alien spaceship then having a alien first contact situation. The bad guys show up space battles ensue  Wow what a first contact.,"hard to believe motivations for leaping into a civil war on some side or another, weak character development, too many unexplained & seemingly disconnected techs",Could have been a great book if the profanity was left out. Great story and very good writing. Reminds me of some of the great sf writers of the past.,"My one and biggest complaint are the numerous editing errors throughout the book, the tale it's self is very well thought out, yet the misspelled/used words distract from the overall enjoyment,,,
Still worth the read..","This story is disjointed, poorly edited and almost unreadable. There is no story development and worse the story is totally unbelieveable.",I liked the first book...then the series changed into vampires and I am sick of vampire themes.  I think we need new bad guy or something.,i looked the title read the summery and thought seems cool but from the first page it was confusing it was horrible and just full of words like it wrote by a 5th grader,"Seems like all the authors have suddenly discovered strong women, giving them super reflexes, a strong will and a ""devil may care"" can't loose attitude. But, a good read and fast paced. I liked it ""alot"".",No flow or detailed story line.  Book lack depth and focus.  Author did not engage the reader with any character build.,"I enjoyed the story overall and the universe in which it was set.  The technology was interesting and the aliens were original.  The characters were a little one dimensional, but got the job done.

The author uses too many cliches and needs to try and stay away from predictable archetypes.  The editing left a lot to be desired, but that is really no big deal and should be expected in a self published book.  I think the author has great promise and just needs to keep plowing ahead.  I will continue to read his work.","I bailed on this book when the first female character was introduced.  Appparently what is important about the executive officer is that the crew thinks she is a lesbian. There was no need to mention the putative sexuality of the male character, only the female character.  I just can't believe in a universe where we can build starships and explore other dimensions, but we can't introduce a female character without discussing her sexuality.",From the first page there was action along with dialog beginning to tie together character backgrounds with the overall story plot.  Easy reading.  Read every evening until I couldn't stay awake.  Of course that means the next evening I had to back up a couple of pages and catch up again.,Great read from beginning to end! Tough  to put down. Had to read it twice because I read it to fast the first time to fully appreciate.,this is a good story but there is a lot of profanity. it is fast-paced and includes elements of technology and sci-fi. there are some editing issues as it is self-published.,"the book might be bit childish with an alien theme,poor character development through words may give the impression of a novice writer.might be of interest for a star ship fan.",overall it is a decent story but there are too many profanities and there are some plot errors,
B00BQYE9H4,Did not hold up well for normal teenage usage.,"I got this case on a pretty heavy discount, I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it.  It fits more or less well, although on the top and bottom edges of the screen the rubber gets stuck under the plastic.  Due to this a little piece of the plastic case broke off around the headphone jack.  Other than that it's a fairly good cheap case, it looks nice anyway.  I probably wouldn't buy another.","Stiff buttons and bad design also very prone to dirt. After just a week the case ripped just from opening and closing the cover on the charger input and the auxiliary cover doesn't even snap shut, it just dangles and doesn't really do its job.","I am very picky when buying anything. I do some research and watch and read several reviews. I liked what I read about this case. I was a bit hesitant when I read the buttons were stiff. However, mine are great! They are very easy to press. The dust guards work well. The headphone jack is for SLIM headphone plugs. As is the charger slot. I use PayPal for my small business and the card reader doesn't fit with the case on. There is a slight rainbow effect on the screen protector but only in a couple of small areas so I think it's a defect on mine.",THIS PHONE CASE fits PERFECT!!!! This is my second Same case for My GALAXY S4. I've dropped it many times and haven't cracked my screen. There's two phones apparently. GalaxyS4 and Galaxys4Active. Make sure you get the right case. Galaxys4Active phone case is a little bit bigger than this one. And your phone will be lose inside the case.,This is the wrong case. I need to return it. I need a case for S4 active.,It was broken when arrived.  Returned for a refund.,Product is ok charging port flap doesn't work that well constantly have to keep closing it because it doesn't stay shut,"I liked this case because it was relatively slim and easy to hold and handle. I did have to ask my other half how to open it up to put the phone inside, since the instructions were in the closed case and I was afraid I'd break it trying to separate the two pieces. Once we put the case on, I had no problems pressing the buttons or snapping the port covers back into place, and the screen protector did its job without a hitch. But I'm a bit of a klutz and was afraid this case wouldn't be protective enough if I dropped it on a tile floor. He had ordered the Trident Kraken, and after making sure I could hold it firmly in my much smaller hand, I ordered one of those and am happy with it. I'm keeping the Cyclops as back-up and would recommend it to anyone not given to frequent fumbling in risky places.","Case is well built, sturdy, and will protect your phone but it has a number of issues.

1) The Biggest Problem:  The Power and Volume buttons on the case are VERY hard to press.  I've tried reaseating the phone several times, but to me it seems that the plastic rim that holds the screen protector in place gets in the way of the buttons.

2) Headphone port is too small. You will need to make sure your headphone plug is a slim type. Anything larger won't fit.

3) Charging port is too small.  Luckily the included white samsung charger that came with the GS4 works fine.  But probably like many other folks, I too have a various micro usb chargers and anything larger than the charger included with the GS4 doesn't fit.

With that all said, if you pay full price for this case, I think you should look else where or wait for Trident to fix the buttons.  Don't get me wrong, the quality of the case; the build quality, design, and details are top notch.  But keep in mind, you WILL need to interact with the power and volume buttons EVERYTIME you use your phone.","Great size, already protected my phone from a couple falls. The charge/data flap showing some wear after only a few weeks. Still very happy with it.","it looks good but my son still managed to crack his screen with the case on. Not sure why, it should of protected it but didn't",Poor fit and still allows dust in. Buttons don't work good either. Bought one for my wife's Galaxy S4 Active and it was flawles. So I got one for my S4 and it was pitiful. So now I have to shop for another and spend MORE money. I'm not happy,well constructed case. Fits nice in your pocket. Not to bulky. The only thing is the buttons are hard to push. Not a big deal its not like they are going to get turned on while in your jeans. Other than that its a good product.,"I bought this case for my husband new Galaxy S 4, it fits perfectly, the phones locks in perfectly. The plastic cover is sturdy but still lets you use the touch screen with no problems.",the phone case looks great on my phone. it is a cute design. it does a great job at protecting my phone.,"the phone case fits perfectly to the phone, however the product quality is poor because it didn't product the phone and there were shipping problems.","The reviews are hit and miss.

B00BWVIN9G,It does allow you to reposition but it isn't as easy as it suggests. I still ended up with bubbles at the bottom of the screen but more my fault than the product.,"Good product, easy to install and looks great on, The price was great also, I would purchase from this company again.",Great product. Was easy to apply . Works with s-pen and feels like its not there. I would recommend. Thanks!,I finally received the protector for my wife's galaxy note 10.1 after long delay of missing shipment. Applying only took 5 mins. I thought it will take longer than the time that I spent for mediadevil on my iphone. But surprisingly 5 mins !! Make sure you use tape technique to remove all dusts out. Using the finger on the screen is Ok but S-pen experience is not as smooth as I thought. That is why I am not giving 5 stars.,"Love it, no problems at all, product is exactly as explained by the sellers with the exact final result mentioned.","Bottom Line: The screen protector works as advertised.

Both clear and matte protectors are provided. The matte protector installed easily with no bubbles. As suggested in other reviews and references available, the key is to clean the device well before application of the screen protector.

The s-pen on the Note 10.1 works properly after installation. The pen slides easily across the surface of the protector and characters and strokes are interpreted correctly. Frequent cleaning is still needed to remove somewhat distracting fingerprints (no more or less than any other screen protector I've used).

In conclusion - it's worth the price.",I followed instructions on packaging and still can't get the bubbles out. No one to blame but myself for being cheap.,"I have a new Samsung tablet and the accessories are hard to fine, but this one really fit. I am so pleased.","Matte screen protector sucked.  Way too dark, and adds a weird pattern over the screen.  The clear protector worked great though.  Easy to apply, and has so far held up for 6+ months without any damage.

Price is high given only one of the two protectors is actually worth using.  Also, the package doesn't include anything for smoothing the protectors - luckily I had a squeegee from the protector I bought for my cell-phone.",I bought this product after I purchased my Galaxy 2 Note tablet and I love the way it looks and how it doesn't leave any scratches or fingerprints on my screen.,"Removed and threw away because it prevented my screen to function properly. Useless and pointless, I would not recommend ever",My friend installed it so I don't know if it was easy or not but it looks great. It has the matte finish on now.,"Time excellent, full compliance, the article is good.  Protection for the tablet is very good, the installation is a bit complicated","The big issue for me was the fact that there were a couple of small creases right in the center of both sheets, which suggested that the damage occurred during packaging or shipping.  As a result, I have permanent air bubbles which could not be removed.  For the price, it wasn't worth sending back.  Otherwise, perfect fit and I have no problem using the device with or without the stylus.  Good visibility of everything on the screen.",Good for its purpose. No complaints!! Overall good experience. Would recommend others to buy this product. You won't go wrong.,"the product received meets the description on the website and the operating instructions are clear, but it is not easy to do completely well and requires some technical skills that can easily lead to air bubbles being created in the sandwich. the overall protection is good, especially yo matte finish.",The matte protector works as it is designed for. Installation is bit complicated but it perfectly fits to the screen. The screen protector prevents any scratches and fingerprints on the screen. Has some flaws while installing like appearance of bubbles. Overall a good product for your screen.,"the product is functional, arrives as described and is pleasant aethetically. it comes at a low price but the instructions are a bit confusing therefore installation is not easy.",
B00BWYDQ36,A rather conservative choice meaning 500+ Greatest poems would be in this collection which perhaps is some form of verification. However the faintest leaning to a more liberal taste would be digestible,I do not recommend this book.  It's full of unreadable poems in the beginning; and by unreadable I mean words that look like another language besides English.  Excessive junk.  I'm sorry I wasted my time with attempting to find something good in it.,"Missing some of the best of Blake, but I do enjoy the really old poems.","Many glitches in transfer to e-book, repeated lines, stanzas...etc. Difficult to find a particular poem. Authors works not always gathered in one area",The poems I could read are masterpieces.  The poems at the beginning of this book are written in Middle English with no translation.  And the formatting is crummy.,"Most of these poems sound like a rambling on of words with no obvious meaning.  I cannot understand the title of ""Greatest Poems""","The first half of the collection is practically indecipherable--olde English, and all that.  Then major poets are rarely cited, not even Emily Dickensen was included.  Too much Shakespeare, not even the most quoted poems from T.S. Eliot, no significant or most noted poetry of Robert Frost, no e.e. cummings and a host of other no-shows.","I have come to love good poems, thanks in large part to Garrison Keillor.  I have also the courage of conviction to declare when poetry is trite, archaic or vapid.  These and other even less complimentary adjectives apply well to about three quarters of these compositions.
This collection will appeal to certain English professors and their graduate student sycophants.
I regret having to be so uncomplimentary, but the English language teems with vital poems, and readers will best find them elsewhere.","So large I am still reading it, every page a hidden gem.","Somewhat quirky in that some famous poems and poets are left out, but there are unexpected gems to compensate if you browse though. Browsing through a collection this size is rather laborious on a Kindle Touch.",A well though out collection. A pleasure to read,Very nice compilation of memorable poems and poets. I would recommend this Kindle book to everyone. It is nice to be able to have these works right in my hands on Kindle.,"Picked it up as research for my book.

I love that my purse sits right next to me instead of spilling all over the passenger or back seat.  It stays cozy and safe and out of the way of my boys' dirty feet.  Installation was a breeze and it has lasted over 3 months without adjustments.  I love this product and will buy more for gifts!,The wife was tired of throwing her purse on the floor.  This setup is working good for her.  The only problem I had was with the straps.  For our car the mounting straps are way too long.  But with a product like this it has to fit multiple applications.  Would buy again,"I love it , but when my Husband drives my car, he says that its in the way. and I agree .","Only fits small purses. If you have a medium or large purse item doesn't fit. Even if you use the adjustment, still doesn't allow for the purse to fit.

When my grands ride with me, my purse was always in the way - now - no problem...this is great!","This in theory is a great idea but it is a struggle to get my purse into the straps, once secured it does do its job.

My purse is right there---for cell phone, wallet, etc.!!","I believe I threw this one away.  Sound like a great idea, but it is difficult to use.  You are unable to get into the compartment you have attached it to without removing it.  You still have to basically turn half way around to get into your purse.  Not for me.",Great for my new car. Keeps my purse from spilling all over the seat and floor of my car. Great buy.,"I really loved this concept, and looked forward to using it for a long time.  Unfortunately 3 of the 4 straps that hold the Pursestringz to the console of my car are pulling off and have therefore rendered it useless.  If these straps had been connected in some other way rather than just stitched to the edges, it would have been a much better design.  I sent a message to the vendor requesting assistance with return or exchange, but have never received a response.","My sister and I had just been saying how cars needed a place to put our purse, and bam, I found the Pursestriingz! Perfect answer!","it has easy installation and an innovative idea that leaves the bag close, but it has a small space which does not allow some bags to fit and gets in the way of organization sometimes.","Small item holder for your vehicle.  Great for small purses, wallets, cell phones, ect.  A very convenient way to store your items while driving.  It may be a little awkward to use, and you may have some trouble securing it with the straps provided.  The build quality may, or may not meet your expectations.

It was terrible. I didn't like it. Not at all. I never give a one star ... but,II kept reading this because I paid for it. It was very boring and I kept waiting for something to happen. Don't waste your time.,I enjoyed this book. It was lacking in some areas but overall it was an okay read. Effie's character could have been stronger but she has some good qualities.,"Loved the surprised twists in plot. Jack is every girls dream. Will recommend to others,  cant wait to read more Andrea Wolfe books!",Found this read boring. Characters didn't really have a lot of personality. I skipped a lot of pages to get book finished.

The whole plot was an excellent idea... and had potential to be something great.. and it just didn't quite get there.  The characters didn't develop, the plot didn't develop...  I almost felt like the author jumped around a bit during the story.  You only get bits and pieces of the story.  I would have loved to have learned more about Effie and Timothy's relationship and why it didn't work... and more about Jack's past... more about Effie's relationship with her parents... more about Jack's past with his family and why they are distant... more about what a psychopath Sam is and more about him stalking Effie.

It was a wonderful love story and who wouldn't love to be with a rock star. I don't think you will be disappointed.,"I don't like to write negative reviews, however this book left a lot to be desired. The writer would ramble on for pages at a time going through Effie's inner dialogue. It got very boring. I started skipping over paragraphs at a time because you didn't need to read everything to get the main idea. There were a lot of little hiccups for the main character, but nothing BIG that would be the climax of the novel. Also, I felt that Effie was a little obsessed with Jack's money. She always references his money before she talked about how awesome he was. Like, my rich handsome boyfriend. Maybe I'm over analyzing, but I didn't really like her as a character. Overall, the writing was decent, but the story just didn't capture me.","this is the love story of effie and jack. the story focuses on the main character, effie, and her daily struggles of a relationship. it takes the reader on a long discussion of her feelings in her self as well as her dealings with jack.",a love story that can get boring because of how long and detailed it is although it had a great plot and good character development.,"the book has a pleasant storyline, about romance and erotism. it's a detailed and quite long read. even though some characters have too much information, it is well written.",

Other than that I do like it and the shipping time was perfect.",This is an okay case for the price.  The case is more translucent that in the picture and it is more of a gold color than the yellow that appears in the picture.  Overall it does the job.,Great for the price!!! It is good and clicks on nicely. It fits secure. The color is bright on the pic but I have a dark phone so it is a little darker. No I just have to figure out how it get it off so I can change up the different cases I have. =),"The case i received was not as vibrant as the one pictured, in fact, all of the colors were muted to the point where the yellow seemed bronze, to boot, the case was very brittle, and broke within 2 days of my owning it.

Most of the time I will have a lot of things in my hand and it will go off and start calling someone or something.

Josie was definitely not the kind of girl you want your son to marry.,Good read for a short story. I will be looking for more of this type. I like Tom Tellers work,"It's hard to substantiate some of the material in this article-length piece, but it makes for a fun story and is worth a read for those interested in the Earps, the Old West, and / or Ms. Marcus.","This is not a story. It's a synopsis, like a Cliffs Notes version of Cliff's Notes.  I wasn't even settled in for my read and the thing was over.",I wish this was a lot longer.  Great short read!  I really like Josie.  Obviously she and Wyatt belonged together forever.,"since not much is known about josie, it's a fiction story based on what is known.  I really did enjoy reading it",I enjoyed this short story.

I wish we didn't spend that at all but not realistic.,"I read this book today as another friend wanted me to cut my cable and save. I started reading and could not stop until I completed reading. Author has taken great efforts to collect information and details that are very relevant to the topic and useful for those who want to save money as per their needs. comcast I have actually gone and cut cable chord now, so thank you Kaylee. We are paying too much money to all these cable companies and not even watching all these channels. you have saved me a few dollars and also created a lot of awareness. So now I will use Roku.","I really liked the frugal guide to cutting cable costs, there was so much useful information given by the author and it was fully worth the cost. I learned a lot in the book about how modern TVs can still function with tv antennas and how far some technology has progressed. Even if you decide to keep your cable then the book also offers tips to help reduce costs with your cable company or by cutting other costs. The guide was simple to understand and provides you information on how to obtain more information about these resources.","Terrible grammar, obviously a lack if editing, very hard read. Just do a few Internet searches on the topic, you'll find much easier to read info there.","When I found out my very stubborn sister was paying almost $300 a month for cable, I was speechless. She knew and had expressed interest in the setup at my house; Netflix, Hulu, and Youtube more than fill my daily requirement for TV. However, she thought they were just ""high tech"" things and she wouldn't be a good fit for them.

In my research of how to explain Netflix and the low costs it accrues, I found this book.

This book was a wonderful companion during my ""intervention"" with my sister. I liked the ideas in this book; even tricky questions like how to watch sports for my brother-in-law were answered.

Personally, if you're considering making the switch or know someone who is, I'd recommend this book completely.

My sister signed up for Netflix and Hulu, and had already told me they don't turn the cable box on anymore. She's cancelling this month, so she'll save around $3000 over the next year if she sticks with it.",Very poorly written. Needs to be edited for grammatical mistakes and typos. Full of fluff with no real information. Not worth reading.,It helps to be reminded again what you might have already known.  The book also provide good resources to either research on or use this resources.  Simple to read through.,"Waste of time. Just skimmed through it waiting for some new idea...
Ideas never  came.
To save money
Put over the air antenna
Use internet

B00CHQOT2K,"Solid, insightful account of the people and decisions that crippled the Romney campaign. The pages go by in a flash and I highly recommend dedicating a couple hours of your leisure time to reading the book. If you're looking for a deep dissertation on Romney's campaign mechanics and political philosophy this is not it.",Author seems to use this to get even with those in the campaign he didn't like.  No real insights; one suspects he was marginal in the campaign staff.,"Gabriel Schoenfeld might tend to the ""neoconservative"" side of the GOP spectrum, and I would likely disagree with him on most foreign policy issues. But that doesn't change the fact that he wrote a great book about the Romney campaign, or that he correctly diagnosed the political consultant/marketer industry as being the primary problem with the GOP.

He also described the consultants' attitude of refusing to acknowledge any mistakes for fear of losing their position in the hierarchy of the campaign. (""Whatever Stevens was really thinking, in the political consulting business it almost never pays to admit error... It is better to stonewall or to spin."")

Laced with hilarious and yet the same time horrifying anecdotes, this is a good book that will probably not be very popular among the RNC power brokers, but will be an unexpected treat to those outside the political world.

Go read, ""A Bad Day on the Romney Campaign."" It's $2.99 as an ebook, and is well worth it.","A delicious detailing of the disaster that was the Romney campaign, written by a senior speechwriter, fully gives the reader the frisson that comes from watching a truly cataclysmic mistake unfold.  The (many) missteps of the campaign can be directly traced to the senior campaign staff (and candidate) and their detailing provides a delightful dash of 'disaster porn'.  A brief, brisk, read that is recommended for both wonks and the public.","There is some charm in this book -- I especially liked the memoir of Ann with her $1 million dollar flying wonder burro -- but he's much too kind to the Willard.  It seems as though George Romney was a decent man, but his son would have been a disaster for America.  We dodged a bullet, folks.",Wonder if the author doesn't have an axe to grind.  His overall conclusion that the candidate operated out of a flawed view of the electorate is spot on.,this is by far the most cogent exolanation  of hiw a good man lost that I've read or watched.  its both inside and prifound,"A decent, if generic rehashing of the 2012 presidential campaign. It is difficult to take Schoenfeld seriously, as the motivation for this book appears to be entirely self-promoting and revisionist. Unsurprisingly, Schoenfeld argues that the Romney campaign suffered from blunders committed by almost every one of its operatives except for him. Objectivity is entirely absent, and what remains is a political hatchet job. The redeeming value of this book was its concluding argument that modern electoral politics cannot be overwhelmed by quantitative data, and instead should harness an emotional zeitgeist.",Much has been written about the '12 campaign and election.  Those who  haven't read a lot about the election and why Romney failed to capture the office of the President may find it more interesting than those who have read and studied other works regarding it.,"Riveting, I couldn't stop reading it. Fascinating to see the role of hubris and pandering in a campaign's unraveling. Really gives you an insider's view.","Gabriel Schoenfeld calmly lays out the many ways that bad hiring choices made by one of America's most talented businessmen ended up with a campaign that succeeded only in burdening a candidate with many of his own disadvantages with the errors, blindnesses, misjudgments and incompetence of an overconfident, unpassionate and incurious set of leaders.  Failing to pay attention to Schoenfeld's book will result in GOP reforms that will institutionalize the errors of the Romney campaign.  There is very little in this account about ideological wars, evangelicals vs social liberals, RINOs vs Tea Party, that seem to captivate the political class.  It is a matter of basic politics: candidates must care, policies must have or be seen to have a soul, not just a list of polling results, authenticity matters to voters.  If you're a righty, please read this short, gripping, beautifully written but angry book. If you're a Democrat or a liberal, don't pay attention to its lessons, please!  (I am a friend of the author's from before his Mitt years and have no acquaintance with his political campaign work. Nor have I ever been involved with any political campaign after Eugene McCarthy's).",I've worked on political campaigns and it never ceases to amaze me that people theorize that what the campaign needs and is missing is EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER. Gabriel Schoenfeld is the hammer and he has identified the problem nail. It seems he rather resented having to work for Lanhee Chen and further resented that Dr. Chen did not immediately recognize and appreciate his brilliance. The inner circle of a campaign is a tough nut to crack and I understand the frustration of feeling on the outside. The useful bits of the book are near the end when he goes after the relentless packaging of candidates.,It is a good read fast moving study of what not to do.  It shows that you need to think about where you want to go before you set sail.,"I enjoyed it. Most of the info I already knew, but it was good to get an insider's perspective.  Worth the download...","This is a quick read that goes over most of the material we already know.  This time from an insider on the Romney team.
It was interesting.","The book is a quick read and the pages go by very fast, so dedicate some time to reading. It contains a lot of information that may be already known about the campaign, but lays it out in a calm and easy to read way.","It's a good story to read, the book contains a lot of information that for most are just theories, but they are real and described very well in the book.",Entry level and easy to read while giving detailed descriptions and painting the full picture.,
B00CINM2YE,Very convenient for walking or running.  Now I just have to get me a blue tooth...  Very good quality and cute.,It wouldn't stay tight on my arm.  When I tightened it trying to get it to stay I ended up getting pinched and have small little bruises on two sides of my arm.  Not a user friendly arm band.,"I was really disappointed in this product. The armband does not fit the Galaxy S4 unless you remove the protective case from your phone. Even then it is such a tight fit that the plastic is pushes up against the touch screen and causes apps to open or the screen to change, so you can't actually use the phone anyway. The arm band is ridiculously huge...it is not made for ""one size fits all"" and the strip of velcro for adjusting it is fairly small. I bought this for my wife, and it was way too big.

Clearly, this is a product with a smaller price point, and I was not expecting it to have the quality of some of the pricier armbands. That being said, I wasn't expecting it to be so ridiculously off the mark that you couldn't even fit the phone in it or adjust it to a wearable size. While the price tag is tempting, this is a deal that is not worth taking.","The Vktech Sport Armband is okay, but its really to tight for my Galaxy phone, so I don't use it at all. It need to be slightly larger.","Started out okay, but not very comfortable because it pinched my skin.  I only used it 4 times when the plastic piece broke completely off, making it unusable and unable to be fixed.",Nice band and a great price but my arm is thin and the strap is meant for larger people.,"This is cheap, so I didn't expect stellar quality. However, I did expect for it to at least fit the phone. The plastic part where the phone fits is too loose for the Galaxy S4, even with a case (slim Ringke Fusion). There are bends in the plastic screen cover due to the poor fit, which hinder the use of the touch screen. I agree with other reviews that said this is not for big arms, though I don't have that problem.",The fit was wrong.  Phone was loose.  Arm band pinch my arm when trying to adjust. Dissatisfied with it. .,Cheap and is just as good as a store brand arm band.,Didn't last long. The strap broke with continued use. It works but only for a short time. I did enjoy it while it worked,"nice quality, I like the vented sides. Doesn't pinch my arm as my old one did. liked the color choices",It's good quality for the price but I need an armband that will stretch as I am lifting weights. The material has no give to it. It's great for running but not for lifting.,It's very cheap. The arm band portion is not big at all so you may need an extender if available. The part that holds the phone is made of a cheap material.,"My Samsung Galaxy 3 fits perfectly in this case.  It frees my hands as I do my workout, mow the lawn or whatever.  I bought one for my daughter and she says the same.  What's even better is that if I decide to upgrade to the Galaxy 4, it will still fit it as well.",I wanted an armband to hold my phone while walking with my dog. Well this is not that great. I received it and the screen was all bent and cant be fixed :(. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it for anyone.,"the product has a nice quality and it's affordable. however, it's focused on the aesthetic more than the quality of it.",The material of the armband does not have good stretch to be adjustable. It is best for larger people. There are vented sides for comfort. The screen cover can bend due to poor fit.,The Vktech Sport Armband is generally well received by users but if your phone is not compatible with the size you will have issues. It can also fit too snugly on your arm so it's best to be aware of whether it will fit your arm and phone before purchasing.,

The first story is my favorite  among all. I was a little disappointed when I realize those stories are just basically sex focus. I don't care to read sex book but just make a complete story (long or short I don't care) about it.,This was a very good short stories this is my first time reading this author. This is a well written group of five short stories with nothing in common except the Consenting Adults theme. I liked all the stories but. Other then that the stories is really creative. I see these four separate stories as a start to their own novels. The bonus story was a surprise. It have a great plot. The cliffhanger had me wanting more.,"This book was good to read once.  The book did not keep me to the edge of my seat.  If you have time and the book is free, this book will pass time.","There isn't much I can say about consenting adults. It was not poorly written, nor was it overly graphic. I just didn't enjoy it for whatever unfathomable reason. I have most certainly read more riveting, and consuming stories. Perhaps it will be your cup of tea, or perhaps you should look for other, better work by Lopez.",Half decent. Plots thin. Some good erotica in some stories.  All in all not a bad read. Good way to pass time,Didn't like the writing.  I would not recommend this to anyone. I like these types of books but this one wasn't good.,Just not worth your time. I'm glad it was free. Such a shame. This story will go nowhere fast. Done,I loved all the stories made me want my husband awake so we can get it on and I also enjoy the spanking like the last story.,Consenting Adults is a collection of spicy stories. J. Lea Lopez captured the moment in each story very well. Great job!!!,"in this very sexy and arousing book...you get to meet some very sex driven and naughty characters. say yes, and you fall into the acts of pleasure and promise! definitely a page turner!!!",Looking for a good romance novel? Skip this.,It was just okay..a time passer... not much storyline to really sink your teeth into. Not one I will save to read again.,"in summary, the book is an adult rated story that entails some erotic story contents. it is also a bit fun and arousing to read.",Well written booked composed of five well detailed sexual consenting stories. Each short holds it's own uniqueness while continuing a world of romance and trill. This genre is more-so for the romantics who love a well told story while incorporating jumping endings.,a collection of short stories that's great for passing time. the main theme shared between each story revolves around adults becoming passionate with each other and having exciting sex. very spicy content but has a thin plot-line.,
B00CKW2V3A,"I'm really loving my way I Wallie iphone case because it's very practical ,it holds what I need to go to work, it's not bulky and it's just easy to carry around in my pocket, and the best thing about it I do not have to open it to answer the phone or make a call or text everyone that sees me with my phone want to know where I bought it so I let them know the name of the wallet and Amazon.com",Design is not ideal. Phone slips to the side and then you cant type.,"I'm using the iwallie and generally like it a lot.  I love that you don't have to open the case to use the phone.  It holds several credit cards.  One minor negative is that the case is thick around the opening of the phone, so it's difficult to hit the keys near the edges of the opening. I have small hands so imagine it would be even more difficult for most people. I like that it has a snap rather than a magnetic closure.  Also it would've been nicer if it had come with a wrist strap.  Last thing:  it took a long time to ship to me.  I ended up receiving it several days after the estimated arrival date, but it eventually showed up.  Overall happy with purchase.","When I received this item it looked fantastic, fit my phone like a glove and the little hiding pouches and card slots AWESOME!! unfortunately when using the phone inside this case it has a tendency to push buttons with your cheek most notably speaker phone but random other buttons are affected as well. great concept, beautiful styling and wonderful idea just not quite ideal","I just received the product, it fits well into the case and nice outward facing so I don't need to open to use the phone.  The only downside is I cannot tap the right side keys with my right thumb due to the edge, have to use index finger of opposite hand. I hope the case will loosen up enough to allow this but not too much where the phone will slip around. I've had 3 speck covers in the last year all to crack w/ the credit card slot, maybe I'm squeezing too much in there though. Still not buying those again and hope this new case will workout once its broken in.",This is the best case I've ever had for my mobile! All in one and more compact than anything I've ever owned!,"The idea is great. However, the case is off centered, difficult to type on the right side. I need to take it out of the case to use iphone.",I really like this cover and I've tried many. My only comment is the phone holder portion of the case should be a bit tighter to keep the phone from moving around. You have to readjust in order to get to the symbols on the right.,The black cars fastner was broken strip was not able to lock,"For the money, quite a good case. Phone stays in the correct place and it holds 5 cards or so. Nice thing is you can over fill it with cash or whatever and it will still close.","Purchased this for my sons birthday.  He likes it but, it is a little two bulky to put in his front pocket. Also if your are going to be bulky make sure you have more protection (as in padding)for the phone.",I love this case! I like that I can use it without taking it out of the case. It works well.,Overall I like this case. Only problem is that the phone moves a bit while inside the case and I end up having to open frequently and adjust positioning the phone so I can type while texting.,"My only problem is that it's already showing some wear, and I haven't had it very long. The edges are already starting to scuff up, and peel a bit. Other than that, it's the perfect iPhone case.",You cannot access buttons with this case.... it is made so poorly that the phone slides out and you cannot even type the letters closest to the edges of the phone. I rarely write review but this one surely warranted a warning to others!,looks great makes iphone more good looking like note and real leather feel look great for office and works professional kind long last quality shines well strong sturdy and smooth. the only drawback is phone slides out the makers should take care for the next time and corners getting tear so soon,"The product is generally good and satisfies user expectations to a large extent. It has amazing features like the size and design. Users expressed their satisfaction with the product. However, some users expressed their reservations with product. Some customers appeared to have some difficulty while using the product.",the case allows you to carry your credit cards and use your phone while in the case. the phone may need to be moved back into the best position for texting. it is a bit bulky but you can fit whatever you need and it will still close.,
B00CLRN47G,"Poor Quality! Not even worth the 10$ I spent on it, fell apart in a week.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",came in fast and so far so good fits perfect and looks just like an otterbox. I don't see how its water resistant though,"The camo is hazy looking, not a clear camo picture at all. Makes it look kind of orange, did not use. Ended up tossing it rather than going through the hassle of returning.","strong durable case, as well as stylish, little tough to figure out how to install don't have to worry about it falling off, as it is a snug fit","i purchased this case but i cant find no clip to fit, its not like the original rugged cases. where can i get a clip for it?",The hard case is really hard to put on and take off. I hurt my fingers every time I tried.,"This was not what I thought it would be like...
But I would buy other things from this seller and I would recommend him to others",It's a great case if your looking a otterbox knock off my only complaint is that the screen protector makes it harder to text.,"I ordered this product what seems like 6 weeks ago and I haven't seen it yet.  I am hoping that the case is able to protect my phone, however since it hasn't arrived I am unable to give it a review.  I am about to write it off and buy a cover at the apple store.","This is just a cheap little case, but is is fairly well made. It is a two-piece case which provides a little more protection if the phone is dropped. I like it.",Love it! I am so glad I bought this case! It's very sturdy and it love how it's bright in color!!!,Forget my other review. The case is perfect and it came in good conditions after at took the protection,This is terrible already peeling off haven't even had it a month! This is very poor quality I will never order again!,"The material is very cheap and inflexible for this case.  Do not fall for the appearance of the Otterbox.  You get what you pay for in this arena.  If you need the Otterbox protection, go ahead and get the Otterbox itself.  This was a huge disappointment for me.",product was alright but the whole back side is pealing off already and its only a month old,"a cheap and strong protection at the beginning, then it starts to give defects and to peel in a short time of use.",The case is strong and can be hard to put on due to the snug fit. The material is cheaper than the Otter Box. The color is bright and the look is stylish.,"this phone case is made of low quality materials, which corresponds to its low price. It fulfills its role of protecting the phone's screen, altough it can get damaged.",
B00CMRF9YQ,"THIS BOOK IS NOT 200 PAGES. Imagine how pissed I was in the middle of reading when the book ended abruptly. I read for maybe 2 hours. Also, as a young 20-year old girl I felt ashamed of my generation along with my IQ dropping as I read this book. I felt...YOUNG AND DUMB. The drama, however, was entertaining. Buy at your own risk...it is only .99 after all.","Claire and Bobbi was the most dumbest girls I've ever seen in my life. And Vyce wasn't any better, they constantly let him play them.",I was expecting a good read with this book but I got exactly the opposite. This book disgusts me. A 30 year old man & 17 year old girls really?! I hope no one is as dumb as these two girls. Then the book was short! Pshh glad it was only $0.99. Will not be purchasing book two.,"This is the best title for this book! Some parts were predictable and some parts had me SMH. Referring to the sucking of toes. Wow. All the little Miss Knowitalls I know will get a lil something in their ear about this book so they can see for themselves how ""Young and Dumb"" they are. Duck Sanchez has a new reader in his books. I hope part 2 won't leave me hanging.....",Not much of a plot and another to be continued. I can say I won't be purchasing the sequel. Not that interesting.,"I know dummies like these and it honestly makes me wanna cry and pray for the real ""Young & Dumb"" ones out there!!! Interesting none the less. I like the bits of comedy too!","Claire and Bobbi so want to be love they are willing to do anything. They are so caught up in fighting each other they don't know they are being played. They both have people in their lives that is trying to earn them. Hopefully they will, eventually start working together to put Vyce in his place with his sneaky, player self.","These girls really were young & dumb (as hell) lol. Easy read, pretty good book, besides the stupidity from these girls but that is what the book is about hence the name, so. I think I'll check out the next part as well, heard they weren't as dumb as we thought lol.",Yea these chicks are really young n dumb : )!!! It was ok I guess it could've been a longer story.,This book has got to be the most stupidest books Ive read so far these girls are clueless . This man is old & the girls are too young for him ! Not a page turner deffinatly predictable! I will not be buying book number 2 .,This is definitely a good ready for da Young n dumb!!! This really takes place in everyday life. Pay attention!!,This book was an okay read but these chicks are dumb as a box of rocks....but read for yourself and see,I need to get part 2 asap. These young girls are truly dumb. Vyce had their minds from day one. I can't wait to see what happens in the rest of the story.,The title of this book tell it all Young and Dumb. It amazes me how dumb the young ladies in this book were. Yes they are young but they are beyond stuck on stupid. It's not like they don't have someone to guide them it's just that they refuse to listen. Pure foolery. I must admit that I am going to read part 2 just to see if the dumb gets dumber!,Glad this was only a dollar or else I would feel cheated. This book truly represents I get what you pay for.,This book of the young and dumb gives an interesting read for youngsters and it gives an entertaining plot of being dumb. It is very short but cheap.,a short unsatisfying read that may make some readers seek out part two. entertaining but senseless drama about young girls and an older man. worth reading because of the cheap dollar price tag.,this book is about girls who are young and dumb. The story is interesting and does not leave the readers indifferent. Its low price compensates for the disappointed readers.,
B00CRAR2GQ,Before I even removed it from the package the bow was off as much as I spent on shipping I should of took a different  choice with a better quality...,"cute and very functional and useful, well protect my cellphone.  Just the white color, get dirty very easy. but it's a good buy for all...","The item I received is clearly used. It is dirty, scratched and the top coating that was supposed to make it look nice and shiny has been peeled. JUST A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!","So, It took forever for the cover to come, but the seller was super attentive and they made up for their mistake, I love the case it is exactly as pictured!","Cute case, very durable, and I got lots of compliments on it. Buttons are somewhat hard to press, but you'll get used to it.","Exactly as pictured. Fit my phone with no problem. The only thing I don't like is that it's a bit hard to hit the volume and power buttons with the case on because the material is stiff, but headphones and charger work no problem, and the speaker hole is in the right spot. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.","I know this case is super cute but DO NOT buy it!  Extremely cheap! Bow came off within a few hours of usage.  And case did not fit S4 well.  Seemed like the phone was always 'popping' out of it.
Super cute but not functional at all.",Super adorable case but it doesn't seem very durable and gets dirty easily.  Good buy for the price. I recommend.,Great. Love this case. It is exactly as displayed. Great protection for my phone and looks awesome.  Absolutely Love it!,"I really like this case, it's great for the price. I agree with other reviews that it is hard to press the power button and the volume buttons through the case. However, I would also like to add that since the sides of the case are not made out of the same plastic material as the back of the case, the sides tend to get really dirty. Besides that it is too cute to pass up and I've gotten tons of complements on it.",this case is adorable super thin and light weight i love it the only reason i didn't give it 5/5 is because the side buttons (side power key & volume keys) are very hard to press other than the that it is made very nicely,Love the case.  Only problem is that the charging port hole is a little small for some of my chargers. But it isn't that big of a problem.,"The cover looks very cute but unfortunately, the power and volume keys have to be pressed really hard for them to work. It looks like there is a small gap between the edges of the phone and the cover, so the phone might slip out over time. Get this cover only if looks are important to you. But if you want to retain the functionality of the power and volume buttons and are expecting some protection to your phone, keep shopping for a better case.","The red thing in the corner broke in 3 days of use, so I don't recommend this product.",Little red bow popped off as soon as my daughter tried to use the cover. Not too pleased with this product.,"a little hard to press the buttons on your phone, but the fit works, but the white color is dirtier.",the red bow breaks easily after not much use. buttons are hard to use. good price and looks exactly like the picture.,it is made with poor quality. so much so that the bow keeps falling off but it is also affordable in price.,
B00CU8OK88,"The fit is great, love the color. What else can I say, other than I need to get more colors in the skin.",I love the flexible and softness of this Nokia Lumia 521. Great color and price too. I like it better than the Panda full diamond design.,"This case was made out of a shiny rubber material and it looks very nice! The problem is that it didn't fit my phone,my phone wouldn't go in the case. And it is the exact same phone they said the case was made for. I also purchased a red and black now however, and those were made of a different material that fix perfectly.",Average product. Over price and not fit perfectly for the phone. I'm still looking for a right case for my new Nokia Lumia 521.,it's good if you have the 521 but for the 520 it's about a 1/4 inch to big for the 520 but over all it's a good case,case attracted so much hair and it always came off when i out it in my pocket. don't ever buy this itrem it sucks,Should say snap on case not soft skin case. The case does fit nicely. But would have preferred a skin.,"it is as described, though it may be just a little loose (a ever so slightly).  can not be sure if this is an issue until i see how it wears.",It's a case. It does its job. Slips off kind of easy in your pocket. I think this has more to do with the lip of the phone and not the case.,"I was SUPER disappointed when I received the phone case and it didn't fit my phone.  My phone is the exact one described, and yet it didn't fit my phone.  Unfortunately no one has gotten back to me about a replacement.  So, unless your phone is half and inch smaller than this one, I wouldn't buy it.","the color is exactly as it shows, but that's about it.i'm wondering if it's supposed to  be for the 520, because the camera hole, speaker hole on the back, and the raised parts for the buttons are all a litle lower than they should be. the buttons aren't noticeably affected, but i did have to cut the holes for the camera and speaker. i had to just barely snip the front to fix the microphone hole. otherwise, it's bee holding up very well, and has protected my phone every time i dropped it.","This case looks a lot like the original phone before the cover.  It is not bulky at all but very thin.  If you do not want a very thick phone case, this product is a good choice.  Though it is thin, I think it will still provide adequate protection for the phone if it is dropped.","This case does not stay on the phone very well. I guess I should have known, it is called the ""Barely There Slim and soft case"". Wouldn't purchase this again.","It's one of those cheap gel covers that you buy at kiosks in the mall. Although it fits the Nokia Lumia 521 well, it collects a ton of dust and other particles. It also adds significant size/bulk to the phone.",just got it....fits perfectly adds a touch of color to this great phone.holes for everything just right...will buy more colors,"the case is thin and has a nice color. the fit is poor, coming loose or not fitting buttons and cameras on the phone properly.",the case tends to be a little loose and ill-fitting and does not provide the protection consumers are looking for.,the phone case looks good and fits perfectly to the phone. the case is made of good material and has shiny finish. it is also available in different colors and aids protection to the phone.,2 disagreements
B00CWL34IK,"I had to dump my ottor box and found an optional case that still doesn't fit correctly. When you put your phone in the case it is so tight it turns you volumn all the way down, really needs cutouts for the volume buttons. The charge cable winf fit my phone with the case so I have to use it no protection, the charge plug is oversized. So I have opted to turn the phone over 180 degrees and use my charge cable. Bad Design.","Bought this with all of the other toys to go with my new s4.  The Case I bought won't even come CLOSE to fitting into this thing even with the insert removed.. it is so far from fitting it is as if they sent me the wrong part.  The ONLY case that I have that will fit this "" Case Compatible "" thing is the micro thin silicon case I got free with my phone and THAT I have to CRAM to get in it.

To be clear , THAT IS WITH THE INSERT REMOVED!  Im going to test it with the insert in to see if the phone ALONE will fit.  BRB.

Well it fits without a case.

Why I didn't see more reviews warning of this I will never know.","Works well, but a bit bulky for travel. I don't use any sort of case for my phone so this works fine. There is a removable shim that allows this to work with an S4 in a very slim bumper style case.

I use this when I'm on business trips so I can use my S4 for GPS navigation in a rental car.  Disassembling this to put it in my knapsack results in a pile of bulky bits that are awkward to handle.

The only quality problem I've had with this is the rubber pad in the gripping arm wasn't well glued in when the mount arrived - and I lost it for a few days.  Once I found it under my floor mat, I reglued it and I've been happy since.  If you get this check that first.","Returned, reasons:
Not case compatible - it fits extremely tight, right onto your non-encased phone only.
From the ad/pictures, you don't see that it doesn't clip into your phone's charger jack when you place your phone into the mount as (in my opinion) good mounts do.  Meaning, you take your case off, put your phone into the mount, then you have to fumble with a power cord that's behind your phone now to get into the side of your phone so that it will charge.

My suggestion, get a phone mount that when you close the mount, automatically plugs into your phone, as many do.  It's way more convenient than this mount.",My previous car mount was designed so that when you placed the phone in the mount it sat on the charging pin. You were able to lift the phone out to answer a call. This Mount has a cord that you have to plug in once the phone is in the mount. the cord is about 2 inches long. Impossible to disengage while driving.,"absolutely useless. It is an excellent MOUNT, but NOT a charging DOCK. One has Still to INSERT the USB cable manually. What kind of deal is that? Not good at all. I returned it.","Worked great, but needed to remove the phone from the otter case.","I was disappointed. The reviews said I could use it with a case on my phone, but, not the case I ordered. I only use it on long trips.","Unfortunately, we had to return this as it doesn't fit the Galaxy S4 case I just bought. To use it, I'd have to take my phone out of the case.

I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing.",this works to hold my phone but i don't know what the cord from the back goes to.  it doesn't charge anything and its just in the way.,"Really well built, does not jiggle around when driving, I used this on my Galaxy S4 and loved how secure it was. I wish they would make one for the note 3.",Phone will not fit in Mount with the phone case still on.,"No where in the description does this say this is a cheap aftermarket product.  All it says is Samsung Galaxy S4 car mount....implying that it is a Samsung product.  I was shipped a generic type mount by ENCASED, with a sticker on it that says ""for Samsung Galaxy S4""

Really disappointed in Amazon for false advertising.  I was expecting a mount made by Samsung.....the one I had for my original Galaxy phone was top quality.....this is just a generic plastic mount.",works great!!! i have no complaints about the device. granted i have a larger case so i have to remove it every time i use this but no big deal.,"Phone fits in it really securely. Usually an aftermarket gps mount is just barely usable and I start counting the days until the manufacturer releases a good quality one. But I was surprised by this mount, because the build quality is above many others I've owned. Including many of the ones made by the manufacturers.","It usually fits the phone if the phone is without a case, but with the case the fitting tends to be too tight.",the socket is usually tight on the phone and you will have to take the cover off your phone to make it work.,"this car support is difficult to fit, providing an extra difficulty to be placed on it, however, when removing the protective cover, it fits more easily.",

My phone easily slips out of the case, even when i have a thin case on does not work.","When I got this phone was it came earlier then the due date. It fits my phone just right and the case doesn't have a strong rubber smell to it, (like other rubber cases). This is a 5 star case. Buy this!!!","I ended up getting my product a little faster then expected. I was worried that the long shipping time would be a problem but it was totally worth the wait. There is small imperfections but with anything there is always going to be things like that. You can see the seem lines where it was made in a mold but I have no probelms. I do know that the ears indeed pop out, but they are easily placed back in. I think for the amount of money I paid this product is perfectly fine. If you are really set on this case I would suggest it again. And I would also happily buy this as a gift for someone. It does in fact not look exactly like the pitcure. They added another spot where you can see the phone, but I think it makes it easier for the consumer to remove your phone from your case.",Totally 100% awesome!

The ears fall off easily.,This phone case is cute and is of decent quality. Some imperfections may be present on the product. The case has ears that can fall off. The delivery service is satisfactory. ,"May be a poor fit for your phone. Ears come off very easily, but can be reattached. Looks somewhat different than the pictures.

B00CY0MAJ8,"This is a really helpful little device ---- for as long as it works. My first one failed after just a few weeks. I sent a note to the company but they never responded. I liked the unit so much I just bought another one. Good product, I hope it STAYS food, because I've sure not been impressed with their customer service. If I found a similar product elsewhere I'd sure buy it there.","This unit acts as shown. I use it for ear buds (medium size)
But... Be sure to get the plug a little longer than the earbud end so the buds don't come off every time you pull them out",Wish it could stop randomly when pulling the cord out but it has to be pulled out all the way.,"It was hard to recoil my charger cord, probably because it was too thick and not pliable enough.","This is a great concept, but build quality holds it back. I got this for my daughter so she'd stop losing her earbuds, and after only two days of use the recoil-action stopped working. Extremely disappointed and I'm unwilling to give them a second chance.",I Bought it for a very thin shaver cord about the width of a telephone cord.  I have to find it to pull the cable out. I have to find it to retract the cable.,Item as described. On time delivery. No problems at all.,This is a really good invention. A great way to keep your charger cords neat and organized.,"Sadly, I have to give this review 2 stars. I really wanted to like this product, but it does LITERALLY what it says -- winds your cord. It DOES NOT stop part way through the wind. I bought two of these and neither one will stop mid-wind. If you want more than just a little nub of your cord to stick out, you pretty much have to unwind it all the way.

I guess technically the description doesn't SAY that it can stop mid-wind, but come on... wouldn't that just be expected? Why would anybody think that non-adjustable winding would be a good thing?

The winding action is very strong. Maybe a little too strong. Weaker cords would require a lot of stress on the cord to unwind.

Bottom line: make this product stop mid-wind and you have a winner.","Not the easiest thing to work, but I guess it does its job.","I ordered two of these, one of each size, for my charger chord and my ear buds. To me they are unusable. The tension can't be adjusted so they suck in the entire chord. They are also very bulky so I can't carry my ear buds in my pocket, the main reason I purchased them.",I had purchased the set a while back and liked them soo much I purchased sets to give to family members for Christmas year before last.  When I needed more I made my current purchase of three medium cord winders.  I like how they roll up to storage compactly and then when I need to use the earbuds I can unwind them and the earbuds are not tangled up.,These were the best things I have purchased to store all the cords you have these days.  I even bought some for my daughters.  I can drop them in my purse when I travel.  No more tangled cords to deal with.,"Great concept and product... with a few quirks. It does require a specific technique that you'll get the hang of after a few tries. I thought it was defective at first but it must be done exactly as shown in the instructions. It did split at the top after a few months of rigorous, daily use - but I was very rough with it. Great product for the price... This device definitely REDUCES HASSLE & AGGRAVATION in my life because it keeps my headphones organized and easily accessible in my briefcase.",Although wonderfully designed I have found the recoil mechanism problematic to the point where I had to throw one away. I still have 3 that are working,"the item arrives as described, it's well made and has a quick delivery. however it sometimes present mechanism problems.","Good product, Delivered in time.

B00CYNN4ZO,I thought the phone case was great (after I figured out how to put it on). I quickly changed my mind when I went to plug up my phone to charge it. My charger does not fit through the tiny hole so I am unable to charge my phone when it is in the case.  My charger isn't the one that came with the phone. I bought a longer one from a wireless retailer and the end is thicker than the apple charger.,Hard to operate touch screen and volume is very low due cover,"So I bought this at a Cricket store when I bought my iPhone 5s. The thing that pisses me off first off is that they charged me $50 for this case when clearly it's a lot less than that. So disregarding that, the case itself isn't that great. I didn't realize until I had started using the phone with the case on that it makes the touch screen a pain to use. When it's properly ""sealed"" the plastic screen in the middle bubbles up, in the middle at that. Which makes it a pain to use the touch screen. I also used this as a GPS and the bubble gave a glare on the screen which annoyed me. I don't know why I opted for this case since I don't plan on using this anywhere near water. Another few things I don't like about this phone is that the start button is incredibly hard to press down. The audio output is nearly impossible to connect into with the case on and the charging port can be a bit tricky to connect at times. I just went ahead and purchased a new case with some screen protectors. Read reviews online before you opt for something.","The only issue about this case is that it does get a little scratched up, but so does the lifeproof. it also does not have any rainbow effect like the lifeproof. it creates a really tight seal, and its not too bulky. nice grips on the side to prevent dropping, and when it does drop its very protective silicone will save your phone. not only is it cheaper than the lifeproof its a lot better. lifeproof is only able to go down to 6.6 feet underwater, with the vault you are able to go down 16 feet underwater with the S4 case and 66 feet with the iphone case.  on top of that it is a lot easier to get to the charging ports. Its definitely a better investment the the lifeproof and its cheaper!!",I was kind of nervous with testing it out but I placed the case in the water with no phone in it and it actually worked. Then thats when I placed it in water with my phone inside and it worked. Just be sure that you have it sealed nice and tight and no worries.,Outstanding took the case in ocean and had no problems. Never went more than a few feet deep. Everyday use is not great,At first I was scared to Order cause of some of the reviews in here but I took the chance and it was so worth it. I did the water test twice with n without my phone and it passed with flying colors. Very satisfied. I have a lifeproof case and this case has better qualities like ppl can hear you better and it's easier to plug charger and headphones. What could be change is making the screen protector flat so it's easier to type other than that very satisfied. Specially for the price!!!,"This is a case you WILL HATE USING AS A EVERYDAY PROTECTION FOR YOU IPHONE! Its VERY ANNOYING! to put it in or try to get it out. its cheap plastic. the HOME bottom it can be very hard to work! , when you need to text or type something it can take you for ever to actually get the little chat window to open! I'm a woman and I have a pretty decent hand/fingers size! forget about it if you had man or big fingers!!! THE CONS: well... I went on vacation to the beach and I still used it and my kept my phone safe! I even took some pictures during playing in the swimming pool! NOT UNDERWATER though. so, it does keep your phone dry and dirt free!!!!!","Package was open probably a returned item, when phone is in the cover you have problem communicating.  Go for a better one if needed.",This Case is ok but the sound during a call seems very soft. Lifeproof cases ar way better. I also had to go on YouTube to figure out how to open it.,"I lost my previous phone to water!  I was worried about the waterproof case and that it might be bulky, heavy and not easy to use.  But it's been great.  My phone is light even with the case. I don't plan to lose this phone to water!  I'd recommend it to everyone.","After multiple iPhone casualties, I decided it was time to put my phone into a ""vault"".  Well, it's definitely a vault.  No one can hear me, I can't hear anyone else and I can't use the headphone jack because the casing is too deep (oh, and the port closure for the charging post fell off after just a few days rendering it no longer waterproof).  Oh, well.  I should have done more investigating before making a spontaneous purchase.","Unable to access side silence switch, difficult to use edges of touch screen. Will be returning, buyer beware. No waterproof or drop proof case could be this cheap.","I bought this considering it was a lot cheaper than a life proof, but I'd rather pay for a life proof. For me, there's a few things wrong with it:
1. It doesn't have a switch for me to switch from vibrate to sound,
2. The case makes the screen too deep and makes it hard to type,
3. If you have an iPhone 5S, you cannot use the fingerprint scanner
4. Inserting headphones or the charging cord does not happen, the holes are way too small.

All it does is protect it. I would only use it if I knew I was going to only need it for the day maybe.",Just ordered this phone case (from Groupon because it was on sale) and it's nice looking and easy to get on. However! I can't fit in my charger or headphones which is super frustrating. Also can't access the 'loud-silent' button on the side. Really I don't think it was worth it. Wish I would have bought the Lifeproof while it was on sale instead. Just ordered an Otterbox instead. Live and learn I guess.,"The phone case make it hard to charge the phone and to use the touchscreen. The phone case is a good price but is hard to use for everyday uses, like talking and texting, the volume buttons are hard to use with this phone case.  It creates a nice tight seal around the phone to keep it protected from water.",this plastic case is water resistant and it provides a nice grip. it can be difficult to insert your charger when using the case. the side silence button can be hard to use also. it is not too heavy.,"This case is great if it is used extreme conditions. However, it is note suitable for a daily use. The plastic makes it difficult to use the screen and the buttons. It also deteriorates the sound quality.",

Doesn't like to stay attached to phone.  Takes nice pictures.",The description does not mention that you need s separate case for the telescopic lens. The quality was subpar as well.,"The Telephoto Lens is a little hard to keep steady in place on my iPhone 5s, but it has an amazing zoom. Works best if you put it on a tripod, otherwise the smallest movement makes the picture out of focus. The Macro, fisheye and wide angle lenses work good, but you have to be careful not to bump the lens because it doesn't hold in place very well. The Macro lens, just like the telephoto lens works best on a tripod. You have to have a very steady hand or it will be out of focus. The extreme close-up pictures are amazingly clear and detailed. Nice lenses for the price.",The zoom portion is pretty useless-sorry it really does not fit properly. The fish eye is good and the wide angle lens is okay,"Hard to position it correctly to get a reasonable picture with the long lense. Pictures are only OK, if it fits exactly where needed.  Not really worth the time.","One clip broke right away, telephone lenses does not work at all, save your money, do not buy.","macro lens just makes things go out of focus, my camera can focus a whole lot better and get the same sized image without the clip on lens. disappointed.","I was expecting better.

Good for experimenting with iPhone lenses or if you don't care about damage to the lenses.,The lenses perform correctly if used with a tripod or a steady hand.  Allows the user to see things that are far away.  There is some difficulty to keep them attached to a phone and the materials are low quality.,"this clip on telephoto lens attaches to your phone for taking close up photos. it can be difficult to get it in the right position but using a tripod can help with this. there are zoom, fish-eye and wide angle lens features.","item does not always arrive with all the pieces. the zoom and focus is good, but its difficult to use, as it breaks easily. some features work best with a tripod. does not work well with a phone case on.",
B00DD5UYOG,This is probably one of the best purchases I have made so far. I bought this for a trip I made and thanks to this product i was able to take pictures and videos.,"The case works great, no problems with it except the back panel was loose when I received it and shortly fell off and was lost.  I emailed the company and they sent me out a replacement case right away, no problem.  The replacement case was received and the back panel wasn't loose and works great.

I was so impressed by this company's customer service, they responded to my email promptly and took care of it right away.  Will definately do business with them in the future.","I have a mophie extra battery pack for my phone and gave this one as a gift. It works great! It's great that it covers the whole phone which gives the phone more protection if dropped! Once you know to hold the power button on for a few extra seconds continually to turn it on when you need it, then it works great!",Great product and arrived on time. Charges phone to about 90% great when u r on the move and have no access to a charger.,"I bought this battery charging case and seriously 2 days after I had it, it stopped fully charging and it wouldn't connect to my phone anymore.","Bought this for my girlfriend for V-Day, since she liked my UNU charging case so much.. I got this one cause she likes pink. After one month the case started to fall apart. The glue holding the metal backing was not good so that came off completely. Then she noticed that her phone wasn't charging any more. I saw that the micro usb slot had been pushed into the case, so the usb charging cord would not make a connection. So in a total of two months this case is now NONFUNCTIONAL I've emailed Alpatronix twice about this, to get a replacement and have yet to hear back from them.. So i'd say customer service is non-existent. DON'T BUY. Get the UNU case instead. They're a great company and have great customer service.","I am comparing this case to my Mophie Juice Pack (which my daughter now uses for her phone).  I usually charge my phone each night, but with this case I am able to wait 2-3 days.  It holds a charge just as a good as the Mophie case, only requiring a charge every 2-3 days with average phone use.  The only downside is that the plastic bumper piece doesn't really match the back.","Very good, does what it's supposed to. Haven't had any problems. Very good addition to iPhone, now I don't have to worry about my phone dying on me","I ordered the pink case - it was supposed to have black trim. - came with ugly salmon colored trim (doesn't match the back pink panel at all).  Cheaply made, adds significantly to the weight and bulk of the phone - far more so than a mophie case.  I will be returning this item.",My granddaughter just loves her new charger. I know because every time she sees me she is thanking me all over again.,"Works great. Charges phone first then charges batter case. Now I can use my phone all day without running to a charger. It does not have a regular iphone charger cable, it is a micro usb cable.","There are many products out there that serve the same purpose as this one. For the price and functionality, however, I would suggest buying this one. The power button in the bottom left is easy to press, the lights light up to let me know of its battery power and charging. It helps me get through almost 2 days without charging. The micro USB port is genius. The material for the back feels sleek and great, but the sides of it are plastic. Regardless, I feel I have enough protection to last a fall so long as it's not straight at the screen, which I'm hoping I will not have to experience.","Easy to use! Case protect the majority of falls. The USB cable that come with it, is a little too short.",It worked ok for one day then stopped charging.  It looked like it was trying to charge but nothing happened.  In the garbage within one week!,"I bought a similar charging case when I bought my iPhone, but after a few months it fell apart. I really like this case because it protects without being bulky, and it does the job well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was because the color of the back and sides don't match. I'm a little OCD about that kind of stuff. This is a great value!","the protection offered by the case adequately provides protection in the event of a drop. the charging feature of the battery pack part of the case will boost your battery to almost full and hold the charge, however uses a usb and not a traditional iphone port. there are some issues with the back portion of the case as sometimes the design tends to start to loosen fairly quickly. customer service seems hit or miss",the case works well and charges well also.  the color is not matching and the case is coming apart and not working after a short while.,The product may have some build quality issues.

B00DD6ICX0,"I order this item beginning of May and now mid June, the protective case ""strip"" id broken after the phone fell from my pocket. Tried returning the item but it does not qualify anymore for returns or refunds.

Case looks nice but it is not strong enough.","Love this case. I'm a klutz and drop my phone at least once a day, sometimes glass side down! This has worked every time!! I bought this silver color as a replacement to try something new with my white s4, but it looked funny. My husband now uses it on his grey s4 and it looks awesome.

Will buy again,"I bought this as a replacement band for a case I already owned where the orginal band broke. These bands are flimsy but once on its rubber seat actually make a pretty nice case. Be advised however that you must use the properly shaped charger for the shape of the band. It's a bit of a pain and pulling it off an on to use a different charger and leads to premature wear.

This band broke a few months later just like the first one. Like I said before, it's not entirely the fault of the band but more of a flaw in the design of the system. Additionally, it really seems like a rip-off to spend nearly $10 on a flimsy plastic part but I suppose it's cheaper than fixing/replacing a broken phone.",I noticed on this new one the area around the plug that broke on my original one has been modified.

If you don't change batteries then you're good.",When it came with the whole case the frame broke with in a month. Then after ordering a second frame it broke again in 2weeks.,"the case is sleek and looks good, and the quality is good. if you charge the battery often, then the case will not last long. using different chargers also leads to wear. trying to get different chargers to fit around the case is inconvenient.","The case is solid for the amount of time that it works.

B00DKHJZUQ,"I am addicted to military novels with Navy Seals and enjoyed the book but sorry to say, and please don't think I discriminate against female authors but they just don't do justice with this type of story line as well as male authors like for example Keith Douglass",I really enjoyed this story and how it wrapped up all the threads of the various plots in the books.,I skipped a lot of pages for this book because I wanted to get to the end.  Not because I wanted to know what happened in the end but the characters just didn't mean much to me.,There was a lot going on in the story. I wasn't a fan of any of the women in the story. They all frustrated me with their brightness. I really just wanted the story to end.,I quit reading this book when I ran across glaring errors in military rank. I emailed the author the error and she didn't respond. It takes no time to Google military ranks and other information or to contact a military public information person at a military base. I would not recommend any book by this author and will not purchase another book by her.,Very poor writing and the story didn't flow well at all.  The author also needs to research military ranks and responsibilities before writing about them.  A petty officer is not in the Air Force and would never be a pilot.,"I never review books but I feel so strongly about this one that it's hard to keep my mouth shut.  The entire time I was reading this book I felt like I was reading a report that had to  have a certain amount of words in it and the author was simply filling space.  To me, a great part of reading is using my imagination.  This author left absolutely NOTHING to the imagination.  I don't need to know which hand a character shook hands with because his other hand was holding a cigarette.  The cigarette wasn't even pertinent to the story line.  The entire book was the same way.  I don't know who edited this book but it was very poorly done.  The story line was good but needed to be developed in a better way.  I won't be reading anything by this author again unless she changes her writing style.",This book was very interesting. Didn't care for the abrupt ending and hope the sequel picks up where this one left off.,"I was really looking forward to this book. It started out okay in the beginning. However, there was to many characters that were flip flopping through the first few chapters.
To many grammatical errors, doesn't anybody read through the transcripts before publishing?

I liked Joshua and Will as the two main SEALS. Other then that this was an extremely slow story and was all over the place.","If you're looking for a book with a lot of military (navy & marine corps) terminology, you've found it;  if, on the other hand you're looking for some romance with a military flair, there's some cheap sex scenes in this book, but otherwise, no romance.","I love military romance, especially Seals, Special ops, Black Ops, etc. There's a new writer in town and Loren Mathis did a great job on this book. The action took us all over from the middle east to Pakistan, Russia and the U.S. The characters are well written. Seal team member Joshua and the woman in his life Victoria a journalist are hot together. I can see 2 more books already on 2 of the other characters. The action was non-stop. I would put this writer in the league of Dee Davis, Sharon Hamilton, Stephanie Tyler and Cherry Adair for military romance. For .99 you can't go wrong so buy it and be entertained. I can't wait for her next book","The writing was equal to my teenage daughters high school English work.
Very disappointed.  I do not recommend this Author.",A very good story about the Seals that I enjoyed . I enjoy learning all about what the Seals do to protect us.,Good book would recommend as good military read  there is an expression that was used incorrectly. The expression is for all intents and purposes.,"While on a tour of the Mid East, former US Congressman Henning is captured and held prisoner by the Haqqi Network.  Seal Team 14 makes a daring rescue of the Congressman.

The US government learns that this Haqqi Network is also trying to obtain the smallpox virus.  Their intentions are evil and they realize that there is no cure with a mortality rate of 50%.  If a version utilizing weapons is used, the mortality rate rises to 90%.  OUCH!

Meanwhile back in Dallas, a young reporter (Victoria Sanchez) is investigating the Congressman.  She has a ""feeling"" about him.... and her feelings are usually correct.

The smallpox virus (3 vials) has been stolen in Russia.  The plot thickens with the involvement of the Seal Team 14 and the FSB (part of Russian Foreign Intelligence) inside Russia.

Will the cooperation of these two units result in the return and destruction of the smallpox virus? And, how does Victoria's investigation of the Congressman tie in with this virus?

I enjoyed the read and thought it was neatly tied up....  Lots of adventure, action and a couple of romances tossed in..

Highly recommended..",The book has a few interesting parts but overall it is poorly written and doesn't describe the military scene very well.,"this is a military romance with a good storyline and lots of good ideas. there are some factual errors, and the story suffers from trying to do too much. it would benefit from better editing and fact checking, but i am interested to see where the author goes in the future.","most of review is so bad and authors story line as few glitches and not well developed, story is very slow and not enjoyable by viewers. story about seals and ops need to be told very detailly to know about them. too many grammatical and spelling mistake in few chapter seems editor of book not done properly.",

It provides very little protection for the phone itself but, I didn't particularly expect it to. It's absolutely adorable, I love it's precious little ears and fluffy little tail. So darn cute!","ear fell off 1st day of use, tail fell off 2nd day of use. decided this is not for me","I heard so many mixed reviews about this case, a lot of people saying parts were coming off and so on, but I still gave it a shot because of the super low price. I have to say that it completely met my expectations, I adore it. It looks just like the picture, its made out of really fuzzy material and the cat tale is simply adorable. The only small complain I have is that the case makes its a little hard to press the side volume buttons and the power one (nothing you don't get used to) but other than that its a great case.","This item took a long time to arrive, which was expected. The case was really cute but after only a few weeks of use the ear fell off. It looked like it had been held on with glue so I tried myself to repair it but it didn't hold. I really wanted it to last because it was so cute.",I waited forever for my case and did not receive it. Then they wanted me to wait the same amount of time to get a new one. But I did get a refund very fast though which was a good.,"this is a very cute case, however the quality is not the best. the ears, tails and fur are not very durable and fall off easily.","Summarily, the case is great. It fulfill its objective functions and satisfy the customer needs. Nonetheless, the company needs to address and dress a number of issues. First, the delivery needs to be prompt and efficient (on time). Second, it needs to address the issue of the parts of the case falling off when the customer is using the item. Otherwise, the case is overly great.","While this phone case is generally considered to be a cute product, there have been as many complaints about the durability and materials it's made of. It seems to not be very practical but with the unique looks it balances out.",
B00E6AQ96Y,"I was looking for something I could wear on my forearm to house my iPhone AND my keys, card, etc. when I ran.  This item looked like it would fit the bill, but when I received it was disappointed to find it seemed rather cheaply made and was way too bulky.  In my opinion it is definitely not worth $20.  I ended up returning it.","I've had the MyBand for a little over a month now and it's been great for my workouts - walking/jogging. I did notice however that the fabric is a little torn already underneath but it doesn't affect the pocket for the iPhone. I've washed it a couple of times already and recommend putting it in the dryer on high with other clothes because if you don't, it'll take forever to dry.

All in all a good purchase. The only thing is that I wish it came in different sizes to fit the upper arm.",I bought this because a friend showed me hers and raved about how great it was. The one I received is different from hers.  Mine has a terry cloth band which looks like it would unravel after the first wash.  Hers was more of a neoprene sleeve.,Perfect for running and biking!  Very comfortable and reasonably priced.  Highly recommend.,There are times when you don't have a purse with you to carry your phone.  The only problem was that it was only in black which was quite noticeable,"If I had any idea the material this is made out of was heavy fleece, I'd have skipped the purchase.  The iPhone fits fine and snug and there's no chance of it coming out, but the rest of the material makes me think I have a sweater on.  Not ideal for summer running.  Would not recommend.","This product worked out exactly how I wanted it. The wrist gets a little hot after starting running, but the band is nice and snug and the touch screen works very well through the plastic.",I have to say that I love this MyBand.  I use it ever day when I workout or when I am working on my computer.  It's so perfect.. I feed my Netflix addiction while I'm working :) And when I workout! I totally recommend it.  It's also really comfortable and not scratchy which I love about it.,"I can not tell you how many iphones I have destroyed while riding my bike, I have had 2 fall out of my pocket and bite the dusk. Total Nightmare. I like that the myband is safe and secure on my wrist. I can not stand the other style holders that are high up on my biceps. Not only does it leave a crap tan line, but it also hurts my arm. The Myband is perfect for a bike ride, and for so many other workouts.",Was so excited when I saw this because of where it was worn on the arm. But when it arrived my excitement turned to disappointment - so cheaply made. Used it once and threw it away. Waste of money.,"I like to extra pocket for my driver's license, credit card or car key. But it is too large for my ipod and too tight of a fit for my Samsung Galaxy III.  In addition, it gets very wet because of sweat and is hard to dry.","I like using this on my arm, which is very convenient and comfortable.  However, the material that it is made out of is very hot.

This would be ideal if it was made out of some other type of light weight material.  I might appreciate it more in the winter months....","It is very comfortable and you can use your phone really easy, but if you have a cover you will have to remove it before, because it didn't fit with the case. But is very comfortable and easy to handle.","Pros:  Convenient when working out, running, biking or if you don't want to hold on to your phone because you want to your 2 hands.

Cons:  After 4 or 5 uses the platic ends are breaking because the stitching material is not strong enough for taking out and putting your phone in.

Summary:  Love the product however, it needs a strong stitching material to hold the the plastic so that it will prevent it from unstitching since you will have to put it and take out your phone several times and the current stitching material doesnt seem to hold.  I returned the product back but I am hoping for new design with better materials.  Hire me as your materials buyer.  That is what I do.  Good luck.",The fabric is too heavy and hot to wear.,"The MyBand is made to house a phone and other small items on your arm. While it's convenient and comfortable, it may be bulky for some. The fabric itself is inexpensive and thick. Also, there tends to be some manufacturing defects that cause the band to easily break.",the myband is a sturdy armband to hold your iphone while on the move. it can be machine washed. it is made of sturdy material but can feel hot. there is a pocket for credit cards or keys. it comes in only one size and color.,"the myband is worn on the wrist while exercising such as walking, running, jogging, and biking. it's perfect for holding your phone, and any small important items. however, it's not a good value. it's fabric is not great quality and only comes in black. it takes a while to dry.",
B00ECN4PWA,"Confusing,Incomplete. Although I like all the things about the Amish community and life. This storytelling way did not make sense.",I read all nine volumes and wished there was some more to read.  It was a real good series to read I really enjoyed them.  Any one that like Amish books would enjoy reading it.  I had a hard time putting my kindle down after I started reading it.,I wonder if anyone edited this book before publishing it. There were so many mistakes I lost count. This was a waste of time and money and the story line Walsall over the place. I do not recommend this book or this series.,"I absolutely loved these books.  I just relax so much when I read my Amish books.  They are a true Blessing from God to me when I read each and every one of them.  I could gush on and on, but I won't.  This review is for each and every one of them.",I have read all of these. This last one was difficult because of the many typos. Need better proofreading. Several times I had trouble following because of wrong words.,"I am so angry with myself for wasting my time and money on these volumes.  I just
like to finish a book once I've started it whether or not I like it.  the  spelling errors
and the. grammatical mistakes were just inexcusable and only made the confusing
and ridiculous plot more unbelievable and uninteresting.  i even reread some portions
trying to mark some sense of the story..just made me dizzy .  I could never recommend
any of these volumes to anyone.r",I am sorry but this was not done very well the author kept getting names mixed up and each new volumes chapters were repeated over and over know that I will never purchase a Sicily yoder book ever again!,I really like the book.  Wish they put all the volume together instead of separate book.  Like the way it ended with everybody together and knowing the truth.,"great,series great story. I loved it  so much going on with the family , very well written and is last of the series","The first ""book"" if you can call it that held promise...but it went downhill from there. The repetitive nature from one book to another felt like a recap of what you just read. The typos I can excuse but the wrong character names in several scenarios left you baffled and rereading until you figured out whose name should have been written. The overall impression I got was it had potential but ultimately I felt let down by the unrealistic scenarios and jumbled storyline.",It was a very good story.  It kept you wondering what was next. Sicily Yoder is a very good writer of Amish  stories.,I Enjoyed The Complete Set Very Good Read,"I enjoyed the series, but I prefer to read an entire novel instead of several short books. I think more time should be devoted to proof reading and not depend on auto correct.","First, I recommend that you read this series within close proximity of time.  It had been some time since I read volumes 1-7,  and as a result I had to review, in order to remember the storyline. As usual,  Ms Yoder kept my attention.  I look forward to future sub-plot spin-off series.",Is no. Way to end a story there was no wedding. You have led me though 9 Books and the end is no where close.,"it's a good book, it has a great story, but it has many typos that made it confusing to read.",a series about the amish community and it's way of life. very well written and has a lot to do with family. there are also some grammatical mistakes in there.,good story out of the book series. a lot of mistakes in this story-line with character mix ups and grammar errors. this ending was disappointing after reading the other books in the series.,
B00ECUG9TA,Maxine quit her day job and opened her own chocolate shop.  At her first catering job one of the guest fell from the balcony with one of her chocolates in his hand.  Well needless to say this was not good for business. Bodies start dropping and Maxine' s shop is closed during the investigation.  At the rate the police were going Maxine would be out of business before they solved the case.  This lit a fire under Maxine and her grandma Ellie.  Story line is very developed and our author does an excellent job building the location of our story.  With vivid descriptions our cast of characters come to life.  Each with their unique personalities.  I really liked the intense build up for the sometimes funny twists and turns that led us to a surprise killer.  You can certainly tell considerable time was done in research and development of the story.  The details were spun with flow of a great story teller.  Fantastic read.,"The story was pretty good, but the editing was terrible.  There were too many punctuation errors; too many incorrect words; one character went from Carly to Marly. I did like Grandma Ellie and Maxine. I couldn't keep up with all the characters, though.  There were too many and they were insignificant.",Good read.  Funny at times. I like to try to solve mysteries  by myself.  Recommend this book and author to those that like to solve crimes!,The story was good. The main characters were very likable. The proofing of this book however was terrible. There were many words that were auto-corrected that we're out of context and  the villains name mysteriously changed during the last 2 chapters of the book.,"Apart from the punctuation and other editing errors mentioned by another reviewer, I found it difficult to read this book because the main character is frankly unrealistic and meddling in her attempts to solve the murders. Maybe it improves towards the end but I may never reach there at this rate. She spoils what could have been an interesting mystery for me.",I liked the book. Anything with food added into it makes it better. :) The only issue I had was the typo's and the name changing from Carly to Marly,"As I lived in Victoria many years ago, I thought it would be fun to read a book set in that beautiful city. I was wrong. This book was almost painful to read: the grammar, punctuation and sentence structure were terrible. A character's name changed from Carly to Marly between chapters. They're, there, their have different meanings and should not be used interchangeably. Many aspects of the plot felt overly contrived; for example, there was no initial, rational reason for Maxine to feel she needed to solve the case. (I won't give other examples so I don't give anything away to those still planning to read the story)  I never really felt engaged in the story or cared much about the main characters. I give it 2 stars (rather than 1) since I did actually finish the book, although I was tempted to stop several times. All that being said, I do think the author shows promise and that this book could be greatly improved by a good editor.","I liked the premise of the book and enjoyed the recipes, as I am a chocoholic. BUT, this book needs a lot of work.  It was confusing. There would be no indication that a particular character was in a room, until they went off on a rant about not being the killer.  I'm thinking in particular about a scene at a catered party, where the protagonist was talking to someone she brought with her to the party, who oddly enough was in the kitchen by himself reading a book. Maxine begins talking to him, and out of nowhere the owner of the house takes off on a diatribe.  Those kind of odd transitions happened several times in the book. Ninjas would love that kind of stealth, but it was jarring and confusing.  I had a lot of ""Where did they or that come from?"" moments. Then the characters had name changes.  Kathleen Sullivan becomes Kathleen O'Reilly and Carly becomes Marly.  Huh? Call me picky, but I expect more out of a book. If this ends up being a series, I honestly don't think I will be reading any more of them.",I would not recomend this book to anyone. The author gives very poor charecter discription's. Example ( He is six feet tall with blue blue eyes) end description. It took me the whole book to find out the main female charecter has green eyes no hair color. When i emailed the author she siad she thinks she gave the main female charecter brown hair. She thinks as in she does not know. I don't expect authors to spend a whole chapter on charecter discription but a brief discription is apricated. And if the authos don't care enough about there charecters to give them discriptions then why as a reader should i read it. ok done with my rant,Very good and easy read as it keeps you wondering.  Lots of suspects to think about plus kindness loving of others. Can't wait to read the next one.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It keep my attention and totally surprised me at the outcome.  Should appeal to suspense readers.,"For the most part, I liked this story but I felt there were too many characters mentioned in the beginning chapter. Yes, they were at a party, but I felt like the author was trying to cram in the names of all the potential victims and suspects into a few paragraphs and I didn't really get to know any of those characters; I did like Maxine and her mother.

There were several editing issues--spaces before commas, lack of punctuation, and the name of one character changed in the last few chapters (from Carly to Marly and back to Carly). The ending felt rushed and I was surprised at who the culprit turned out to be as there weren't any clues along the way to even hint at this person's involvement.

All in all, this turned out to be a pretty decent effort; I think this author can only improve with more experience and a little editorial help.","The title and cover alone were enough to make me want to dig right in, but the story is a good read too. It's a satisfying mystery, but not too heavy with gruesome details. I could relate to the characters in this one. And who doesn't enjoy reading about chocolate?","Maxine launched her new chocolate shop and catering business with the BC Historical Society's Annual Fund Raiser when land developer Ron Vandemeer collapsed holding a half-eaten chocolate in his hand.  This wasn't the front page picture Maxine wanted.

""Chocolate Worth Dying For (Death By Chocolate)"" is a great book that grabbed my attention from the very beginning and kept my interest to the end.  It's a worthwhile read I recommend!  Chocolate Martini anyone?","I enjoyed this story very much. Part of it is that I have visited Victoria and know the city for its beauty and incredible views. Therefore the author's wonderful descriptions took me back to a place I loved.  Plus, having a book being plotted with chocolate playing a role almost as one of the characters is a brilliant idea. I mean who doesn't like chocolate? Maxine, our heroine, the owner of Au Chocolat, a brand new chocolate shop and catering business, begins the day full of confidence that her new business is finally taking off. She has huge aspirations of success until the first dead body literally falls at her feet and it looks as if one of her chocolates is the cause of death. From that moment on, she becomes consumed with finding the answers to this mystery to the disgust of her sometimes boyfriend, detective Patrick Shannon. Surrounded by both friends and enemies, no matter the danger, Maxine never gives up the hunt. To my delight, at the end of the book, Ms. Amsden has added recipes for chocolate yummies. Love it!!","Overall, a decent read with some errors. Simple for the right type of person who enjoys these types of books.",good book and enjoyed reading it about the food however it needs lots of effort to understanding,"The book is an interesting story about a chocolate shop owner that becomes wrapped-up in a murder investigation. Although, there are many errors with the editing including grammar, punctuation, and continuity. Still, it's a fun read with a mixture of characters.",

Still ended up buying a new phone. Complete assembly kit but no adhesive comes with it and the plastic tools are cheap and break off in your phone.,It works perfect for my AT&T HCT one X I can't tell the difference...,Good 1 my phone is going fine so far can  not find a difference in the original and this 1.,"The package included all that you see in the picture EXCEPT, the suction cup, and two guitar pic style plastic tools. All in all I'm satisfied with the product.","To start, I'll say that for the $35 or so I spent, it's an almost okay deal I suppose. But just maybe okay. I don't like it, but I have to live with it. My touch screen digitizer and screen has had a minor imperfection since the moment I bought it. I figured I'd make it right by replacing the screen! Well, to my surprise, the screen that I ordered (yes, the one you're reading reviews for) works but is not very pretty. First thing I noticed was the more gray color to the physical display. I figured no big deal. Then I turned on the phone. BAD quality compared to the original screen. Now I don't know if it needs to be broken in or something, but the screen quality is comparable to dumb phone screen (where you can see all the colors of the rainbow if you look closely). This horribly makes the whole phone look like junk, but, for now, I guess it'll work... At least my touch screen works now... but I'm no longer watching good-looking high quality videos on my phone anymore... :(",was sceptical at first if this was the right screen.but indeed it fit perfectly for my htc one x.,"I installed it a week ago and it works great. I cannot tell the difference between this and the original screen, so I am very happy.

So I lost my money on this.,"Arrived complete as advertised. Finding complete instruction on how to open this device was a challenge, and installing the components not for the faint hearted or inexperienced. Do check that the display works before reassembly!! The connections need to be firmly home else they do not work.
Only item missing is some double-sided tape that is thin enough so that you can assembly it properly, opening it up seems to destroy the original.","a screen with a little difficulty when installing it, in some cases after a few months it stops working.",sometimes arrives broken and does not work. it is best to make sure it works before using. screen works best on certain products. does not look very attractive.,"in the initial stage, the screen was fitted and worked well. there is a problem with the reliability of the screen - it is easily damaged and the touch screen is not working properly. also, the tool kit for open cell phones is of poor quality.",
B00EHSUFD8,Wonderful and exciting book. Love Cindy & Mattheus.  Can't wait to read the new book.,"I was disappointed in the typos in this Kindle Book.  The story was too convoluted to enjoy.  I kept waiting for it to get better, but it didn't.","Story was okay, but editing left something to be desired.  A littler hard to follow  with grammatical and character errors.","I am enjoying this series however, they seem to b running the same story line...fianc,wedding,murder...more curious if Cindy &Matheius work out.",Have read up to 7 in the series and like the books. I enjoyed reading this one the most mainly because it had far less errors overlooked during proof reading. Hope they continue to be better so I can add Jaden Skye books to my list of favorite authors.,"Fun, fast read. I figured out the killer from the beginning but not the final twist. The one less star comes from the poor editing of the e-book. Names were mixed up making it a bit difficult. But all in all .... Give this a read. I'm going to read Book 1 next.","I enjoyed this little mystery. Lots of interesting characters, twists and turns. What I DIDN'T like about the book grammatical errors and misspelled words.","Same excitement as I experienced when reading the entire series of books on the Caribbean Murder series. I relax on the hotel and surroundings from Jaden's description. The serenity painted of the beach scenes and cliffs and waves beating against the shore whisks me away to Aruba! And the fact that I can't help but wonder as I read who did the dastardly deed!
Now I will move on to the last book in the series. anxious for my next journey - ticket in hand -ready to board Book 8!",I like this series.  Each book makes you feel like you have experienced the island yourself without having to actually leave the comforts of your home.,I wish I had read the reviews before I downloaded this today.  I wasted precious Sunday reading time with a book filled with errors!!!,I couldn't find a single character to like in the entire book. Not even the detectives!! Are all these books the same?,"This was one of the most poorly written books I've read in a long while. Not only were there numerous typos and errors (some of major importance such as using the wrong character's name), but the language was elementary and stilted. In addition, the ""romantic"" subplot between the principle characters was so negative my most frequent thought was, ""Just dump this loser!""",This book captured my attention immediately. I was drawn to the characters. There was also a love story intertwined into the mystery. This book had all the ingredients for a very good novel.,"Good story line, poor grammar.  Enjoyed the story line but many missing words or incorrect words made for a hard to read experience.  Would like to read more of this author and see if there's better editing in other books.","Books set near bodies of water always tempt me to read them. I am usually somewhat generous in my reviews, but this time I can't do it! This book was so disappointing on a number of levels that I stopped before even reading halfway through it. There were many typos. The dialogue was juvenile. I didn't care about the characters at all, they weren't real. They were very shallow.","the story of the book is good, fun and short, but there are many typos that make it difficult to read.",wonderful and exciting book. lot of interesting characters. the book is captures the readers attention. totally story was nice. but many grammatical and words errors in this book.,this book has a good story and interesting to read however some grammatical and typo errors reduced this book ratings.,2 disagreements
B00FCNKTPQ,"The poor grammar was too distracting.  I found myself editing as I read and was unable to get caught up in the story.  I am SO frustrated by the number of 3, 4, and 5 star reviews.  There has to be a way to weed out the paid reviews as well as reviews by friends and family.","For a new author, this was a very good read.  It had a good story line, plot and climax.  The attention to detail made you feel like you were a part of the story. The ending leaves you wanting to know what the future holds for Megan & Aiden.  All on all I enjoyed the fact that Murder For Neptune's Trident didn't revolve around sex.  A nice ""clean"" book for all ages.  Can't wait for the sequel!","I typically love free books, and I understand there being some typographic and grammatical errors. However, this book was so full of errors I wasn't able to enjoy the plot. What little character development existed was overshadowed by the authors repeated attempts to create a detailed environment. However, she spent so much time pointing out which character was riding in which vehicle, and stumbled over the details of each scene so many times, the redundancy made me want to tear my hair out!
I barely made it a third of the way through this book; the plot was dragging out so slowly without any obvious development that I gave up. Not worth the read.",Megan  is quite happy with her life. Until the day she sees someone shot sand thrown overboard. It would have been safe but a cellphone rings. What happens next really opens this story. Thanks for the good reading.,"Loved the book but way foo many editing errors.  Good plotting, fun characters and a touch of romance.  You'll enjoy this book.","I happened to discover this book while searching for a new cozy mystery to read. I figured at 99 cents I had nothing to lose. I was pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed this book. Yes, I will admit there were some editing errors (Lucy was called Lori once, & a few words left out) but it truly did not take away from the content of the book. I enjoyed the characters, the setting, & the story. I read approximately a book a night, so needless to say I read lots & lots of books. I only write reviews on those I truly enjoy. I would definitely recommend this new series to all. I can't wait for book #2 in this Citrus Beach mysteries series.","Ok, I don't usually write a review if I think a book is bad, but, I bought this book and then didn't even finish 1/2 of it. I feel like the author used a lot of descriptions to explain EVERY thing as a sort of filler so the book would be longer. Plus, she used exclamations points on so many sentences that it drove me crazy. I read a ton and can usually read books that are even mediocre until the end but I literally could not make myself continue to read this book. Very boring.","I enjoyed the plot and the characters very much. I think there should have been more editing and proofreading. I'm usually not one to nitpick, and when I run across an occasional typo, I don't think much of it. However, this novel had several instances where ""women"" should have been ""woman"", and ""where"" should have been ""were"". I even saw a couple of dangling prepositions. There were times that I had to reread a sentence or paragraph to decipher what the author was trying to say. I found it very distracting, and was looking for the next mistake or misspelling instead of enjoying the delightful story line.","Let me start off with that fact that I did not finish. I read about 2/3 of the book.  I imagined that this would be a cozy mystery but really was like a warm blanket and a cup of chamomile tea- in a bad way.  As soon as I started to read it I would quickly put it down to sleep or do anything else.  For starters the pace was off and the characters seemed a bit like dishwater.  Out of touch with reality with their dialogue and actions and having little to no spunk or pizazz. Editing aside,  just a very ho-hum boring read.  Thanks","Disappointing and frustrating to read. I try not to be a rampant member of the grammar police, but the multitude of grammar, punctuation, tenses, phrasing, spelling and word usage errors were so glaring on every page I found myself distracted from the story.  I realize new authors need to hone their craft, but that shouldn't have to include learning about sentence structure and spelling.
The story started out with an interesting premise, but the ending was a very weak resolution for the crime.",Really enjoyed this book characters were great real creeps which is what they're supposed to be really great story.  love the dogs everything about this I really enjoyed I look forward to reading however many she writes,Enjoyed reading this book. Characters are interesting and fun. I live in Florida so I can relate to things going on. Sounds beautiful where story takes place.,"I live in a posh part of southern Spain where this type of story would not be out of place at all, so could really relate to it. The book is well written overall and I enjoyed the story completely from beginning to end.

This is a light fictional read for a less than a price of a coffee and will keep you enthralled for hours so is really worth buying and reading especially if you want to relax and spend an afternoon or evening and be transported to Megan's world of suspense and danger.","I have been reading other reviews and I hate to repeat what has already been said.  If there is a newly edited version, I didn't get it.  It was obviously spellchecked rather than edited:  ""residences"" for ""residents"" as an example.  Torturous to anyone who has a reasonable command of the English language.  The story line is good enough that I might have read the next book, but I have corrected enough English papers that I have no intention of correcting a book that was bought for pleasure reading.","I have enjoyed reading several of the books in this series but they all have one flaw, they need a good editor - there are so many wrong word choices, wrong tenses and for goodness sake, there is a difference between plurals and possessives.  Other than these distractions the story is interesting and flows well...I love the locale, the situations are believable and the characters have a nice dynamic.  If you can overlook the errors it is worth getting invested in the whole series.","this book has an attractive romantic story and captivating characters, however the grammatical errors are very annoying making the book difficult to understand.","The most commonly cited issue with this book were an apparent abundance of grammar errors. While acknoledging the book was free, more than one reviewer claimed the lack of proper grammar and punctuation detracted from the experience of reading the story.","the book is well presented, comes with a nice plot, the characters are nicely written, interesting and full of details. however it has many editing errors and grammar errors.",
B00FUUDP1G,"This is truly a good HEA. I liked that it had just enough angst to make it believable and the OW vile. The story line is about those who have money and how the parents decide who they will marry. It's about two people who grew up around each other, not run in the same crowd. The parents work together and want the company to stay with in the families. This is a sweet story of what happens when there is a spark there. I look forward to other work by this author.","So trite and unimaginatively written. I kept skimming faster and faster, hoping there would be something worth slowing down for, but in the end, I really couldn't have cared less.",I was totally into this story I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters except for that snake in the grass Ruby. Lol. Very enjoyable.,"Kind of a tried and true story line. Nothing new or original. Not a bad read, just nothing exciting about it.",Michele married her friend Brad not because she loved him but because her and his parents made them. He was always gone on business trips with his assistant Ruby. Michele knew they were having an affair she thought all the signs were there. Michele got pregnant and didn't know what to do. She only had a year to go along with this charade and then she could leave. Can this be true love ?,"This was just so... bad. Brad had no personality. He wasn't one dimensional, he had NO dimensions. Michele never expressed her feelings and did nothing but internally freak out and/or cry. The misunderstanding between them about Ruby was laughable; so trite and drawn out that you can't believe the author even went there. Lastly, STOP writing about wealthy people if you no nothing about how they live. They got married in a hall?! A one carat diamond had Michele gobsmacked?!","I liked the main characters and the story.  Michele's and Brad's families have been friends for decades.  Their parents want them to marry and find a way to force them to comply.  Of course, being a love story, they do fall in love.
The only issue I had was with Brad, wondering why he was so willing to be away from his bride so often,for such lenghths of time.  Not sure most women would have hung in there as long as Michele did, when Brad finally figured a few things out.","Marriage of convenience stories are usually a tad predictable, but this one was just awful. The heroine is a moron and the hero is an ass.  One decent conversation and the whole ""issue"" that plagued them would be over. But no...we have to perpetuate the stereotype of the weak crying female. She can own a business, but can't muster up the courage to tell her husband about his whore of an assistant. Get a pair, lady.","It was a quick read, but the characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue flat and trite, and the storyline both predictable while being pretty ridiculous. I'm glad it was free.",I didn't have any expectations when I started reading this book.  It turned out to be a quick page turner.,"Kind of immature heroine. She kept 'suspecting' things but never said anything and the Hero was a douche. ""OH, you felt neglected even though I ignored you. I had no idea'....","Nice little story of the unique problems of the moneyd Southern States - how to keep the money in the family, regardless of the personal consequences of the people involved in the arranged marriages. Lucky for our happy couple that they actually do love each other... lovely little romance",This was a fantastic story. I enjoyed reading every page.  I hope others enjoy this book as much as I did.,"The couple has almost no dynamic throughout the book, the guy is an ass that the author tries to portray as oblivious, but comes off as stupid, uncaring and down right cruel to allow what goes on. The heroin[?] is a complete patsy. Shouldn't have read it through, it never got better.","I chose this rating because there wasn't a zero.  I agree with the other 1 star ratings (wish I would have read them and saved my time).  I read less than 1/4 before I skipped to the end to see if it got better.  It didn't.  Don't waste your money.  Even if it is free, it's still a waste of time.",product b00fuudp1g describes a story about michele's and brad's families. this story tells the truth about the money and how the parents decision about marriage. this story author clearly explains about the things happened in a real life while making decisions about the marriage and how to overcome the situation in hard time.,this is a good read about marriages of convenience and the drive to keep money in the family. the story is quick and the characters not very well developed. the female character is frustratingly oblivious but it is a memorable story.,boring characters with a basic love triangle story-line. good read to pass the time but not exciting.,
B00FVXZ57Y,"Don't waste your money.  I'm sure the author's time is worth something, but the writing was very bad.  Why say ""as stated"" if you had stated. Or how many howevers do you need?

May help if you were trying to grow from bulk plants where there are no directions included.","This book covers all the processes involved in having a garlic garden, however it seems to me that there is a lot of information missing. In addition, this book is full of grammatical errors, which make it hard to read. It would be great to have some illustrations, for example there could be one with the part of the plant, the different stages of growth, the ideal places to plant the garlics, etc.
My recommendation is to wait for a new (and corrected) edition.",I like this book due to the fine details. It's a must read for growing garlic and doing it right.,Will I have garlic this spring ?

Even the most savy are quick to learn about the importance of sustainability,and all in one book!","It saddens me that books are put on the market without adequate proof reading.
Nearly every page has grammatical errors or typos. It took away from my reading pleasure.

I have had gardens since age 8, but never had much success with garlic- this short presentation answers a lot of my questions & points me in the right direction. Have some soil amending to take care of, but looking forward to putting these guidelines into practice in my garden.","I found this to be overly verbose, full of fluff sentences, short on actual detail, and mostly generalizations.  You have to read through entire paragraphs to find one sentence that actually says something useful.","The information is a little better than the absolute basics, but the book seems to be written as a high school research paper. The author's writing style is a real turn-To off, and to have a good garlic garden, there is a lot that this book doesn't cover.",This is a  very well written guide for the novice planter of garlic.  My husband has planted garlic for 13 years and he picked up a couple of tips from of it.  Well done.,This pamphlet reads like a junior high 4H report and not a very interesting one. Read the seed catalogue and the directions that come with your purchase. Skip this its not worth it.,There is a lot of good information in this book. The book could use a good editor. It could probably be a third shorter if all the unnecessary fluff were edited out.,Has some good information but the content doesn't flow well and is not organized.  It lacks detailed descriptions.  Pictures would have helped.,I can't wait to get started!! I Love Garlic in everything! This spring you are going to find me in my gardens!!,"For a book entitled ""how to plant.."", it was woefully short on actual, usable instruction. I was expecting, and hoping for, something along the lines of a checklist.
Something like:
1. Buy this specific brand of garlic.
2. Prep your soil using this.
Etc.
 Instead we got advice that basically came out like ""it's really important that you buy the right type of garlic. So, make sure you do."" And ""it's really important that you have the right type of soil, so check that out."" Not too useful to me. There were a few good nuggets, but the title was quite misleading.","not well written and doesn't flow well. it has some good information for an experienced garlic gardener but, needs more detailed information in it for beginners.  needs helpful pictures","it is a book for guiding a garlic garden with useful information, albeit with some obvious errors.",The book contains a decent amount of useful information however it's held back by a lack of editing and the author's bland writing style.,
B00GATDL7O,"The best part of the previous game were the ship/pirate adventures and that is all this game is! I rarely do the actual story, just cruise around stumbling on to hidden missions. I love when the crew starts in on their shanties! Highly recommended!","Excellent historical music from an excellent game. Not ""commercialized"" and very much as it was intended to be heard (without musical accompaniment).","I love the shantys the sailors sing on the ship in the game while looting and pillaging on the high seas!  Unfortunately both of the Sea Shanty Editions are a mixed bag.  You'll get some of the acapella on-the-ship songs, but also some of the songs you hear when you visit the pubs in the game.  Those songs have instrumental backup, some are sung by women, and some are in languages other than english.  I like them all, but wish I'd known ahead of time that there was a mix of the two on each ""disc"".  I also wish that there was a disc with just the on-the-ship shantys.  But if wishes were fishes, we'd all be pirates!  Yar!","Only has a few actual songs from the game. What songs that are included aren't bad though, just not quite what I expected.",let down.  i bought it before even reading the play list.  it's got a couple good shanties but it's missing most of my favorites.  it's actually missing most of them.  not bad but not great.,It was a good album but only 25 total minutes of songs makes it almost not worth it. The y should have put all the shanties on the album.,"There's only a few of the good shanties on the album. And it's only 16 tracks. They could have put all of them on the album, especially since most of the songs are only a minute plus in length.","Loved the game, loved the music, I guess I would have liked this to come with all the shanties in the game, not just a select few.","Unfortunately this album does not contain all of the shanties which is a shame, since they are great and really strike a personal chord with me since I am in the military and these are very similar to our cadences. Since this album doesn't contain all of them, Here is the YouTube video with 35 of the 36 shanties.
[...]",This is a beautiful soundtrack to match a beautiful game.  The sea shanties get easily stuck in your head and you can almost feel yourself on a ship in the 1700's when you listen to them.,"Like most of the other reviews, I'm going to highlight the fact that this only has 16 of 30-something shanties from the game. Major bummer. Prolly only the ones they got the proper licensing or permission for. (My hopes is that they'll add a 'patch version' of sorts to make up for it later on!)
Same thing happened with the Lollipop Chainsaw soundtrack--very anticlimactic compared to the amazingness of all the songs you hear during gameplay. I ended up just buying all the songs individually.
Luckily Amazon MP3 has this album for (rightly) an inexpensive price--and I think it's worth that much. They also have a great selection of sea shanties in general, so just search that and you'll come upon some great old classics, too.","I didn't think I'd ever grow attached to another AC character after Ezio died and Conner, well, sucked. I was wrong, this game, the plot, the action, the characters and everything about it rocked.","A solid score with a few memorable themes that pop up several times, some use of electronic music and electric guitar help convey the feeling that nothing in an Assassin's Creed world is quite real while also injecting the score with energy and momentum when it needs it. About half the tracks feel a but like filler, more ambient type stuff that serve perfectly well in the background of your island hopping, but maybe not necessary to keep on the album. The real treat for me was the collection of sea shanties on disc two, which seem very authentic. So much so that I'm curious if they were sourced from real sea shanties of the time period.","Nowhere near enough sea shanties on this official Sea Shanty Edition. The shanties and tavern songs are what give Black Flag its soul, and without all of them this edition feels hollow and quite frankly insulting. Ubisoft could be raking in the Black Flag doubloons hand over fist with a complete edition of these wonderfully crafted shanties and tavern songs. Bottom line not worth the 8 dollars.","I love the soundtrack to this game, I really do, I'm really disappointed that even on the so-called ""Complete"" Edition, we still don't get all 35 Shanties in one place. Fortunately the Companion App on the phone makes me download them to the phone in order to hear the songs, so I have a collection of all but the one Shanty we have not yet found, that will be remedied soon enough.",This a lively soundtrack including sea shanties from a popular pirate game. There are 2 discs and 16 songs.,"the sound track for the game will not disappoint the users. it has around 16 tracks that makes the game much more fun. about half of the songs are added as fillers. overall, the sound tracks are good to listen.","disappointed that it doesn't have all the shanties on the game, so its not very long length of time to listen to them.",2 disagreements
B00GB0VRZA,I enjoyed this little love story.  Sweet and down to earth happenings.  Fast reading.. look forward to reading the other books.,I thought this was terrible! No relationship development at all. I'm glad it was free or I'd want a refund.,I'm so happy i didn't pay for this book. I thought it was going to be good. I couldn't even finished it it got so boring and lame. Hannah freaks out seeing Bryce blowing off steam. Come on she has had no abuse in her life she would not react this way. The age thing is just so dumb. Nobody in this day of age cares and 15yrs is not a big difference. Hell my husband is 12yrs older then me and it had never crossed my mind when we first met that it could be a issue. i got over half way through and just had to stop. I won't read the other books. It had a good idea but the writer needs to make it more exciting people are not that insecure for no reason. You cant get lost in Hannah or any one else in this book.,"While there was an announced reason for the protagonist to meet the hero, there was about zero plot to this book. I suppose, if you want to call relationship interactions that you are ""told"" about rather than get to see, that possibly you could call that plot. However, the author felt like she was in such a hurry to get the relationships set up with each other that there was no real story or plot to this particular book. I caught myself thinking several times that if this book had been set up to demonstrate why this winter/spring romance was awkward or used the plot device of the SMALL Wyoming town to demonstrate prejudices as some reason for them to avoid the romance in the first place...this might have been a good book.

In short, the characters didn't grow or learn from each other--and you probably won't either.","I'm a sucker for sappy romance stories so I loved the romance aspect, but it was too fast paced and the ending was a let down..everything needed more detail.","I'm not a reader of romances - prefer comedy dramas and non-scary or non-horror sci-fi.  But did read the book all the way through and I though, as a romance, it was a nice book.  Just not my type, but that is no reflection on the book, just on my taste.",This book has very little plot or character development.  It is really not very well written and I find it hard to believe that it was actually published.,Hannah is the second oldest of five girls whose father's death has forced her into leadership when her mother fails. She finds that all she has done to secure their home has failed. She now has to humble herself andxask for help. She goes to the neighbor who was good friends with her dad although younger than him and older than her they find an attraction for one another that cannot be denied.,Exciting book hard to put down. I will sure to follow the other story lines about the sisters. Can't wait.,"The story line could have been really interesting, but the writing is very repetitive and the ending is bizarrely abrupt -- as though the author simple got tired of the story and walked away.  I don't think I'll be reading anything else by this author for at least several years.  Perhaps with time and a lot of practice her writing talent will improve.","I love to read and this was kinda boring and humdrum. I'll never read the rest of the series ,","No character development, no discernible story line, glad I didn't pay money for it.  I found I didn't cre about the characters or what they were doing.",I loved this book it was amazing I loved the details and the romance also the struggles Hannah went through,Book was completely rushed and just hurried along. Like she wanted to write a book but didn't  have time so just slapped something down. Needed more...,"An ideal, realistic approach to a modern day romance. Prince charming is found where you're least likely to be looking",The book was poorly written as its plot development seems like it was rushed.

B00GG02SIA,"This is you reading my review. This is you wondering whether a story about a serial killer stalking a swimming team will be interesting. This is you wondering why anyone would write anything in this annoying style. This is me warning you that the novel is written in this aggravating, headache producing alienating fashion. If that is not bad enough you have one dimensional, unlikable characters who behave selfishly and oddly throughout. There is no suspense and the only thing satisfying about the ending is that it is over. Although the author's portrayal of swimming meets and practices is accurate, these are the cattiest, nastiest, pushy sports parents ever. Their kids are not much better, a bunch of entitled brats. But perhaps the biggest disappointment is the serial killer. If you want to make a mystery boring, well this is how you do it. Pass.",the writing style is definitely an acquired taste - but I'm kinda quirky myself so I enjoyed the change -  My strongest suggestion is to read the opening chapter and see if  you find the writing format oddly enjoyable. The suspense was delicious.,"lot of swimming, not much else...plot eh, characterization eh, conclusion eh...had to finish it to see how it ended...eh","Apparently, the unusual writing style used to tell this story annoyed lots of readers.  It didn't particularly bother me. The story was a good one and I didn't have any trouble sticking to the end.  The characters were not the most believable but it was not a bad way to pass a cold winter night.","Written from an interesting perspective, I liked the character development. The ending was satisfying.","Told in the second person, this is a book that makes You, the main character. That can be very distracting but you has your moments. A serial killer is on the loose and only You knows who he is. You can't tell the others who he is and the only thing you can do is read helplessly while the other characters slowly figure it out. Oh you!","The first two words in the title of the book is the way Ms. Murphy began many sentences in THIS IS THE WATER, and it seems to be her writing style. To me, it was an odd, unique style and took a bit of getting used to.

THIS IS THE WATER is about a swim team, the parents of the swimmers, and about a murder that affected the entire community.

I was looking for a mystery, but found a book mostly about swimming and the personal lives of the team's parents.

It was a bit difficult to get started because of how the book was written.  The book did keep you guessing, though, about who the murderer was that was killing young girls at rest stops. When it was revealed, the scene was quite scary, and the murderer was someone you wouldn't expect.

I continued to read the book because I wanted to find out how it would end, but I did skim quite a few pages.  2/5

This book was given to me and my book club as a win in a contest on TLC.  No compensation was given, and this review is my opinion.","Murphy's prose is not for the General page turning crowd;  His style demands focus and attentiveness.  However, once I got used to the repetitive nature of Yannick Murphy's writing I could not put down.  Great Story with captivating characters and action!","This is a novel that is written in a very unusual style which is actually part of its success. It develops characters, builds suspense and twists and turns the plot all while keeping the reader hooked until the very end! Excellent read.","Liked the story but found the stylistic approach heavy handed and distracting...if I never read the term ""This is..."" it'll be too soon.","One of my favorite books of the year.  The unusual writing style helped build tension as the story unfolded, and kept me interested.","Do not like the writing format ""This is ____________  Ridiculous that a killer would decide not to kill someone in their grasp because they are not young enough!",The constant reference to the swimming pool became tiresome after awhile,"Like The Call, this is not a conventional novel and that is good.

While I applaud the author's experiments with style and techique this book began to grate on me about halfway through. It would have worked better for me if it had been a shorter book. With fewer characters. Or more well defined ones - I found myself reading for pages and not knowing what character we were with.

The swim team milieu was interesting and full of detail.
The author is good at atmosphere and contrasting the ordinary and extraordinary in life.

While I can't give this 4 stars I feel it is a noble effort and I do look forward to her next book.","This is me reviewing This Is the Water. Yannick Murphy delivers a chilling psychological thriller that threads together the lives of a community and especially one of its members. But as much as I enjoyed the story and its pacing, so many paragraphs start with ""This is the water... This is you, Annie....This is you in the foyer...This is an evening at home....This is Dinah deciding to lose weight.... You get the idea. I can't believe Murphy's editor did not say ""I refuse to let you ruin this book by adding so many clunky starts.....you are not allowed to use the word 'this'.""

I would have given this book five stars, but all the ""this is"" thrown in really derailed the pace and the tone, which is a shame because Murphy is a very good writer and this story is quite compelling. A bad idea all around.","unusual writing style and unusual characters do not always make for a good read. the jarring style takes you out of the story way to often to really enjoy. it wasn't worth the time spent wading through ""this is the water"".",this book has some bad writing style and the story is like not good to read but some of them like the ending of the story,"the thriller about a serial killer stalking a swim team. written in a unique style that some find off putting, while others think it works well.",

Well, it was a nice change from the normal wolf storyline but a few scenes had me a bit iffy. I won't give too much away, I'm just saying it seemed a bit wrong at first.

For me it crossed a line that I probably won't read part two.,the book is very interesting and different and it has a good romance story and would be interesting to see how the story continues,romance series make more interest and expectation and need to more focus on it. love story about wolf make the fantasy the reader. focus on different kind of romantic stories like interracial like that. two major genre is very important romantic and fantasy. vampire stories are more interesting and the reader like to read fantasy stories.  should be focus on editing and without grammar mistakes.,"the book is a good read and has a great price, but some points are confusing.",

Too bad that the book is not finished. I'm so tired of continuous line of half-books! It turns into really BAD authors' habit!

I prefer version 2except that it's the bad-guy who wins in the end.  But having the bad-guy win is a great twist, and does a great job of making the story that much more memorable and emotional.  I feel it also makes the story more complete in that it answers a question about a character mentioned earlier.  And honestly, the story spends more time proclaiming the expertise of Ma, and less so that of our guy.  So why should our guy end up the victor over one who seems the more expert sniper?  Having Ma win this encounter also alludes to the fact that the VC did defeat the U.S. in Vietnam, in the end.","This short story was beautifully written.  It was a quick and engaging story.  I could not put it down, once I started to read it.  Choosing an ending was an interesting option.  The first one I chose, I did not like.  I read the alternative, which is the one I should have chosen in the first place!  Based on the details and descriptions, I could tell the author has first-hand knowledge about his subject.  I do not usually like ""war"" stories, but would recommend this to any one as a ""human"" story.","I remember going off Hill 55 , south of DaNang looking for a sniper that was shooting Marines back in 1966 and this story takes me right back to that dreadful time...the sounds, the smells, the rot, and the damn bugs...",Very easy short read. 10 minutes or so. it is almost like a chapter from the many exploits of Carlos Hathcock.,Very short story. Characters were not developed as well as they could have been. The ending was weird as you get to choose between two different endings.,"The shirt story was interesting but very familiar. If the name of the sniper was changed to Carlos you would have a true account of one of the many great shots made by an actual Marine Corps sniper. Sgt. Carlos Hathcock ,known as White Feather, was a Marine sniper in Vietnam and had more confirmed kills than any sniper in country. This definitely seems like a case of plagarism to me","This is a re-telling of Carlos Hathcock's story, without any mention of Sargent Hathcock of the Marines. I think it is shameful to do this, and it isn't very well written anyway. Not worth the time to download and read. It's only a few pages, and of almost no value to anyone.
If you want to read about Hathcock's exploits, search for other books on Amazon, but avoid this one completely!","This was a very poorly written, short story, which I thought was misrepresented as a book.","This book is different in the way it is written and presented, but we'll written.  The book was enjoyable however I wished it was more in depth.",Kinda short but was interesting. Wish it was longer and we could learn more about the characters in the story.,"Good story some fact some fiction.
Not what white feather would have done but makes for good reading for a short story.","Ghost Sniper is a great story, and I hope there is a sequel.  I also really enjoyed Winter Sniper, but I can't say which book was the best.  They were good in different ways.","This is a story that's a retelling of other stories. Save your money, & time don't waste it on this waste of ink.","This story is not worth it. Some good things, but mostly bad. Should just write a whole book.","The overall theme of the reviews is positive, with most readers enjoying the story and finding it rewarding and entertaining.  Most seemed to enjoy the fact that you could choose your own ending as well.  However, a few did not enjoy it and thought it was not particularly well written.  Overall the reviews seemed to be positive and reflective of the story itself.","The author gives their take on the story of Carlos Hathcock, a US Marine sniper. The story is short, easy to read, and interesting, with the added twist of an alternate ending. It is left to the reader to decide which ending is best for them. Worth the time to read.",
B00IGK7IRO,"fun read  He clearly loves what he did, the good and the bad. I found it encouraging as I contemplate following him down the ICW and beyond","The best thing about this book is that from cover to cover it's one episode after another of the many things that can and will go wrong.  Would strongly recommend for the average dreamer who has their eye on cruising.  The author isn't a professional - that's an understatement - but if it was ever true that the best lessons are taught by mistakes, then this book is full of lessons.","I wanted to read this book because we have the same boat and we're looking to cruise in the same area as the author writes about, but I couldn't finish it.  It's not edited, it doesn't flow well, and some of his facts about sailing and locations are just wrong.  This trip was done i believe in the late 80's and maybe the author didn't keep a good log, so some of the facts are off.  The short stories within the book are a paragraph or two long and then they just end, leaving you wondering what happened.  There is very little discription besides, we got stuck and now we're sailing again.  I congradulate him on doing this trip as a lot of us are still just dreaming about it, but the book should of been gone over before he put it out to digital print.","Even Amazon has not corrected the book title, which shows on its web site as Paraduse instead of Paradise, an indication of the wrong words appearing in a book that was spellchecked electronically but not proofread by a human.
Examples: guaranteed for quarantined!, plain for plane (boat plaining?), once in a time for once upon a time, without incidence for without incident, cautious to for careful to, etc. Author take note.
In spite of all that, as a former Caribbean sailor I enjoyed reading about the stupidities described.","By today's standards he will be quick to offend some. But to me, this kind of honesty is greatly lacking in today's overly PC world. Good read for me",Stories is a strong word more like ramblings. Hey he did it and I'm just reading about it so who am I to judge.,An easy read that was just the right length for the subject matter covered and in a context of normal experiences with normal people. About what I thought would happen to me if I chose to go cruising.,"l have been sailing for over thirty years, mainly on a coastal cruiser.  The experiences described in this book are ones that most sailors will encounter at one time or another regardless of the size or type of sailboat.  This book will give valuable information to those considering buying a sailboat.  A very enjoyable read.","Wow, what a nice book, a testimony that if you really want to do something, you have to go for it. It takes you with them on their voyage, with all misfortunes and also the nice things they experienced. I hate when the book is over... I'd like to go on for ever reading... very nice book.","Thoroughly enjoyed being on this cruise as an armchair sailor. I am a power boater, 19 ' yacht on Hudson River. I dream the ""Dream"" and love to read and put myself on board for sailing & cruising adventures. Thanks for a great cruise!","Bumbling through Paradise is more so bumbling through this book. It is poorly written and even poorly organized. Being a sailor for over 40 years and having sailed extensively through the Caribbean I had expected more. Some parts were entertaining and even enjoyable in the couple's movements through the Northeast, but the use of the Caribbean certainly could have been fully portrayed. Cover picture is excellent and probably brought on the sale of the book, though it was purchased as an e book.","I am a just learning to sail so this was fun and informative for me.

Easy to read and entertaining too!","The more I read the more I realized that the author is the type of person who illegally parks his car in a handicapped space because no one is using it and he only needs it for a few minutes and then is proud of himself when he returns and doesn't find a ticket.  He tells his stories of ""Bumbling through Paradise"" with a complete lack of self awareness that many of his mishaps were the result of negligence, ignorance or disregard of boating skills and regulations.",Very funny and interesting book....the writer has a hilarious sense of humor without purposely trying to be funny....lots of interesting sailing predicaments encountered,"In the work world as in anything else, you can do the same thing, year after year for 10 years, or you can learn and grow and improve over the same period.  Both give you 10 years of experience.

It's hard for me to believe that the Thackers did as much sailing as they say they did before they embarked on this adventure in paradise.  I couldn't believe he actually said he didn't have much experience tacking.  Isn't that the very nature of sailing?  ""Tacking!""  Whatever happened to the ""Ready about?""  ""Ready!""  ""Hard a-lee!"" that I learned as a child?

Yes, bad things can happen if you are not prepared.",this book is soo funny and interesting . this writer has good sense of humor. this books includes strong words. this book has full of morals and gives more self awareness. and this also has words easy to understand. gives more detailed information who are willing to buy sailboats. this seems soo entertaining. gives good details for sailors too.,this is an easy and enjoyable read that is helpful for anyone who wants to learn about sailing. predicaments experienced by the author are recalled with humor. it is also an inspiration to follow dreams.,"This book gives cruising and life advices, it's entertaining and it is not too long. However it's not made for soft-hearted people and the honesty could be a bit too much for someone. It has grammar problems and it's clear that it was not edited by a human but rather a machine.",
B00IGSMYHK,It was very helpffull in educating me on the reason to hire a proffessional. /it really is a good idea to  to have a good plan before one strarts buying plants with no real plan.,"I'm a landscape designer & contractor myself and I can tell you that Ms. Mathews presents the true realities of the trade & art.

There are so many misconceptions of what landscape design is and what beauty & value it can bring to the home. Ms. Mathews presents those points very clearly.

She also talks about what to look for, and yes avoid, when choosing a designer and contractor(s).  For the person looking to landscape their home either as a DIY project or to hire people in the trade, her book will prepare you for both.",It might be a good book for some but I did not understand many of the concepts and decided to ditch the read and spend my time on other methods and gardening. It was a waste of time.,"I have not finished reading this book, but it has been helpful in designing my landscape for my front yard.","Great book! I have not finished reading it, but it has been helpful in designing my landscape for my front yard.",Don't bother with this one.  No new information here.  I found nothing useful in this e book.  Pass on this one.,Boo it was harabal I d I d n or like it a b c d e f g h,I was looking for a book with some ideas for DIY and this was more about employing someone to do it so not what I wanted,"Brief. Pretty general, and gives a place to start.","Very boring and rambles on about choosing a designer or designing it yourself but never gets to anything really concrete about design, in my opinion.  I was looking for a more practical guide.","This book has good, basic information for how to plan your landscaping. It offers several options for creativity and I like how Ms. Mathews doesn't just tell you how and what to plant but leads you to your own design.  A few more photos would be a nice addition if the book is ever revised.","To get any benefit from this book it is important to understand what it is, and what it is NOT.

Written by a British landscaper, It is - ""... an overview of what is involved with successfully landscaping a garden*. It is NOT a step-by-step guide on how to do it (see Rachel's other books for that).""

*Rachel is careful to point out ""For our American readers, when I say garden, I mean yard or landscape. For us Brits, garden means the whole thing, not just the plant borders!""

 It is a free book which is why I have given it four stars. It is thought provoking, which is, presumably, the intended goal together with very straightforwardly nudging the reader towards the author's other products and services.",Don't know where to start?  Start here. Good tips for absolute beginners. Can help you save money by helping you plan. Also good at letting you know what pitfalls to avoid.,"I really appreciate this writing.  The humor (humour) was classic, however the many analogies made complex explanations easy to digest.

She shares great tips that will inevitably save you time, money, and unnecessary hassles.  There is a great explanation of the many different options and the differences between them (i.e. Designers, Landscapers, Builders, etc.).  They each play an important, BUT very different role.

Regardless if you are planning a DIY project or hiring the pros - with a large or small budget the key is - PLANNING.  I didn't know so much was involved, but if you take the time going through this process properly, you will enjoy your garden much more for getting it right.

BEFORE jumping out to do your garden, READ THIS.  The authors 20 years experience is truly priceless.","No actual design ideas (except for the few pictures). A lot of good information, but just not detailed drawings of basic layouts.",detailed and informative with lots of pictures to guide the reader. may be too beginner for some experienced planters.,the general consensus is that this is a book for beginners to get some knowledge on landscaping and how to go about it.  in general it does not go into depth on landscaping techniques.,this book is very good book it provide the information of how to design our own landscape models and designs. this book is very helpful to carry out our creativity. with the help of this book i design my own yard.,
B00IJKERAM,"good interview about a subject that is not on the top of my radar.  Ms Finke is successsfk  as much in her own mind and voice as in actuality,  There are better books and subjects to improve our minds","Wish it was longer, gave me a real sense of Finke. The woman behind the stories and the myths. Riveting stuff.","I was expecting specifics, not such generalizations of the industry. All that the studios, agents, actors, etc are doing is changing with the times to stay viable, just as the rest of the country has had to do. Nothing new. Disappointed.","Ms. Finke is indeed a special character who claims to tell the ""all-revealing truth"" about current Hollywood.  She has strong dislikes, a highly-developed sense of outrage, and, especially, a bloodhound's knowledge of where the bodies are buried. She also regards herself as a Holy Icon, and interviewer David Blum is afraid to probe the Icon too deeply, lest it turn and bite him. Finke controls him, and says very little. She knows a great deal more. This isn't in fact an interview. It's a fog-machine covered in gauze. It could have been stunning.  Not worth 99 cents, alas.","Too many ""that's crazy"" and ""that's stupid.""  This sounded like a summation of an interesting subject by a vocabulary- challenged teenager. Save your money.. Don't buy it.",This interview with Nikki Finke was a revelation.  So much inside information from the ultimate insider.  I don't think this book would be of interest to everyone but I was totally intrigued and fascinated. This was not nearly long enough and could be read in an hour but it would be an exciting hour. Highly recommended.,"Exceptionally honest - I love NF.  Nikki  is right though most people in the biz seem to paint honest, intelligent individuals - who do not believe in denial - as risky leaks  at best.",A short and interesting look into the wacky world of entertainment from the wacky world of journalism--two peas in a pod?,"Finally. An interview with Nikki Finke, I'll buy that for a dollar! I found it to be quite the enjoyable read. I worked as a Hollywood junketeer for over a decade. All those years, regardless of what outlet anyone worked for, everyone read Deadline. Not true any longer, now that she's moved on. Great that she's enjoying herself with a well-deserved break.",It was boring the conversation was choppy and hard to follow. I got very little information from the interview. Wouldn't recommend it to my friends.,"God, what a waste of time. The interviewer gets steamrolled and the promised ""dish"" in the teaser copy fills up less than one page of this random cache of musings on what supposedly is the state of Hollywood.",Love her.  Love this.  Can't wait to see what's next for the straight-forward and controversial Nikki Finke.  Here's to hoping she does something soon.  Deadline has become a disaster without her.,"This is a really sad and pathetic ""product"" consisting of a transcribed interview that seems much longer than it is because it is so lacking in real content.  Nikki Finke rants and raves with all the certainty of a lunatic who's incapable of grasping the notion of nuance.  Unpleasant?  TOLJA!!!",The interview was very boring and not what I expected. A complete waste of time as far as I am concerned. Seemed to be self aggrandizement more than anything else.,"A quick, honest glimpse into the twisted world of Hollywood.
Nice, fast read, well wrote.
A refreshing insight into what makes box office hits and misses.","An intriguing but divisive interview that you will either find revelatory or bore you to tears. Offers a good amount of insight into Hollywood, and what you discover may be something you weren't entirely prepared for. For good or for ill.","This book is a quick look at the hollywood scene and professionals made by a journalist who is incredibly honest about her thoughts and expresses them thoughout the book. It's not a book made for everyone to read, and it is pretty short.","nikki kept it short and sweet with this one. while you may not get an encyclopedia of hollywood insiders, it was entertaining and brief. a cute read. not for everyone honestly .",

Good thing it was free but still terrible.",Thus trio/tag team made this story lots if fun. A hot steamy quick erotic page turner to keep the fun going,The book was okay.  Not enough hot sex scenes.  I liked the way the men treated her.  Would not pay money for this book.,I clicked on this book by mistake and took a glance.  Blech......,"a little dry.but if you're lucky for a quickie it's ok. check it out.

it was ok. worth a read.","'Reading Fanatic (CMP)' does an excellent job of summarizing the specifics of this ""short"" so I won't bother.

Interesting concept but a bit short on execution.  I thought that the 1 sex scene was rather bland/vanilla but really liked how well these handsome hunks treated Sandy.  At only 33 pages, one can't reasonably expect a literary award winner.  However, for a story less than 35 pages long in the erotica genre it was pretty standard content.  Like most ""shorts,"" in the genre it read like a one scene excerpt from a full length novel.  There is minimal character development, 2 salaciously gorgeous men, a M/F/M sex scene missionary style and no condom used which was a bit disconcerting for sex with 2 guys that are obviously participants in a high risk sexual behavior.  Okay as a freebie but don't think that I'd want to pay for it.",Threesome are fun. Enjoyed the newness and excitement she had. Having two hot men manipulating your body is such a pleasure.,Something totally different from what I have read,This novel was a great sexual read. Loved the way the author described the sex as well as the characters. Looking forward to reading the follow-up series.,"Sandy didn't dress right or have a positive outlook on herself

I could see all the characters, and just by reading, I felt like I was there watching.","This short book is about a fun erotic story.

B00JPJQR4U,"Really enjoyed this series, waiting for the next book.","This book is well written if not for the periods instead of commas!

It is worth reading but is not outstanding.,Yeah - it was good and made you want to get the second one - which did not live up to the potential of the first volume.,The story line is good. The characters are not bad. The main character is a perverted and drunk version Malcom Renolds. Not a bad thing per say not my style. Other character development is not bad. I read the book until the end I didn't hate it and I didn't love it. I am a sci-fi reader and if your looking for action packed wtf am I reading then jump on in.

It did not end on a clear note.  Obviously one of a series but not self contained enough for me.,Really bad.

Sheer commercial content, I am sooo tired of zombies, vampires and ghouls, didn't read enough of the description or I would never have bothered.  Author has some ability to make you interested, but dumps you into the characters rather than letting them develop with the story and let you discover them.",Very good story kinda old west gangster space epic. I liked it!!,Good book a rather weak ending.  I was disappointed in it as it left you hanging and I'm not sure if I want to read more even though it was a pretty good read until then/,"It's like the scriptwriters for the 1970's Battlestar Galactica had a hand in this. The author needs to learn something, anything, about outer space. At least I haven't come upon The Impossibly Dense Asteroid Field... yet. This makes the ""Far From Home"" series seem like super terrific writing.

I'm going to finish reading it, just because I've read everything else on my phone.",Take a few English Composition courses.  Please.  Learn to use more verbs.  One for every 10th sentence is way too few.,"Quick read. Not really what I like in Sci-Fi. I prefer much more character development. Yeah, the story was futuristic and space ships and all, but developing the details about only a couple of the characters is limiting how involved someone can get into the story. The ""bad guys"" are a little too obvious and killing off a love interest of a higher profile character even though she qualifies as a bad guy really dampens the enjoyment of the story.","a creative idea using a mix of space and western in combination, although it is poorly written sometimes.",a somewhat enjoyable sci-fi novel with a lot of action. those who want thoughtful story building and well developed characters might find it a bit superficial though.,"the main character is perverted and drunk, and the story is science fiction. you can tell who the enemies are. the spaceships were futuristic.",
B00JW1R79U,American Lara Croft wannabe. Very predictable. Not much action for this type of novel. The FBI doesn't work outside the U.S. like this. Felix Leiter was CIA remember.,I thought it was exciting.  You wanted to keep reading it to see what happens next and how they are going to get out of the next situation.  I was a fast paced book.  There was no slow parts.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.,"This was a great fast paced adventure story with just a bit of romance in it.

It was very interesting historically and finding such a thing as the Minoan Mask.,"Chyna Stone seems to be too easy going and not worried about anything as she works her first adventure. The helpers she has are not too worried either, but they spend most of their short time in this book moving from hotel to hotel. The book is very short and there is little character development. Too bad, but the plot was interesting, except K.T.Tomb claims to be an archeologist, but make several errors in the book.",I enjoyed the book and how it got right into the meat of the the plot. Can't wait to read another!,First time reading this author. Liked it very much. Kept my attention and a good plot twist. Will try another of this type of author.,can't believe I wasted my precious time reading that piece of junk. what a light weight!,Interesting ancient Greek and Minoan history. More romance than I normally find in the kind of books I read.  The Lost History team in a scramble to find an elusive mask.,I love thrilling stories that involve archaeology.

B00JX4TOLA,"good book to read if you like interracial like me, however it's a 3 part series. This one was good let's see how the others  pan out",Stunned at how quickly this book turned into complete ridiculousness. That scene with her ex was laughingly bad and there were so many instances of editing mistakes that it became distracting. The characters themselves also weren't that great. I definitely won't be trying out book two.,"Quite a few editing errors, characters needed more flesh and bone, jilted lover wasn't believable.  suspending reality just didn't work.",It was a nice read but I guess I'll have to read the other books to get the full effect.,"I liked the characters. I like the ease in which the writer sets her story. One flaw, the character comes from the ""east side"" of Chicago? Poor? No way. Still I liked the book.",This I  the first book by this author and I would read another. Carter was a terrible person after his accident but that don't mean that you should be so cruel. Vanessa is a good hearted person that had helped a perfect stranger. I was very pleased that after spending time with Vanessa that Carter was now working on being a good person. I would recommend this book to anyone who has found that the story is very good.,"Cute story, editing needs to be done because it was missing a bunch of words and other things. Vanessa went to NY because she was deciding if she would take a CEO position or not. They gave her a month to figure it out. She ended up meeting Carter, who was on bed rest from an accident. He thought she was the maid, go figure, and was rude to her from the jump. The book moved by telling what was going on with them over the weeks. Then her ex, the one she'd dumped in the opening pops up. Her and Carter seem like a good couple until the end something about her keeping a secret from him. Not sure about reading the next one but I'm not saying I won't.",I hate that I can't read more loved it so much,I liked how the story started out wish it was a little bit more detailed but overall a good read. It was a little dull because I found myself drifting off while in the middle of reading. I barely remember either character or their names.,I came across this book...because I was bored and wanted something new to read.  It was a good book.  The author hooks you with this book and there's about 2 or 3 more in the series.,Why!!!!!! I hate when I really get into a story and find out I don't get to read the ending because it's to be continued!! Who started this trend? It needs to stop! The story was good and I loved the characters. I hated the TBC of an ending.,It was just ok. Nothing great at all about these two and definitely nothing that makes me want to read a part two. There were many grammatical errors and quite frankly neither Carter or Vanessa struck me as CEOs of anything.  Thank goodness it was free.,"I'm so tired of new authors or maybe she's not new and I've never seen her...not listing that it's a continuation, serial, or series, whatever you want to call it, until the very end...I had already purchased before the other review, but another author has done this, and all I can say to authors who do this is ""SHAME ON YOU!!!!""

Definitely not worth the buy.,"The cliff hanger, buy another book has started to wear on me.

This could've been a great read. It moved along quickly. Easy to follow but something is missing. Like the yeast left out the bread. I get the idea of the storyline but then it turned to a drama not love story. Trevor did not enhance the story for me, now the mysterious caller. Just tell the man already. If she told him about the job, tell him the other secret. Gees.

It forefront to me towards the end","Lot of the people give positive and very thrilling review about the product, it was very nice to read and give lot of thrilling to the readers about that story","The book holds your attention from start to finish. Some details are not revealed in this volume (there are 3 in total), which stirs the emotions of the most anxious.","Most users enjoyed the book, with some noting they wish the book was longer or more detailed.

I wish I had!","The book was truly amazing and very entertaining, loved every bit of it.",Love this book and waiting to read the other two,"For all of the potential of this novella, the brevity of it, which resulted in stunted character development, was disappointing. I wanted  to root for her, but I wasn't given enough to understand her motivations  or his for that matter. I wonder if more time had been given to story development, I may not have gotten whiplash from the breakneck speed at which the plot developed. Sadly, even the little teaser at the end isn't enough to salvage what could've been a good story. Because it doesn't make me want to know what happened next.",Good book for a cold or rainy day.,The ending was too short. Looking forward to the next book.

B00KFAT4QG,Too much about Bill and didn't really get into understanding her.,"The only thing I enjoyed in the book was what was written about her childhood.  She is a smart woman, but sure likes to tell the world,  No humility there.

Wouldn't recommend it.","Not finished reading yet, but enjoy what I have read.","It took me back for a second look at Bill Clinton's presidency. Then it gave me an insightful view of Hillary. She is an amazing woman. She was definitely eclipsed by President Obama's campaign in 2008, but I don't think we have heard the last of her. The Dems could do a lot worse in nominating someone else for the next presidential candidate.","Nothing but battlespace prep for 2016.

This woman is evil!","This read like it was a propaganda pamphlet for Hillary. I am not political at all, but the ""YEAH ME"" quality was so overwhelming that I became disgusted and simply never finished the horrible piece.

It was very interesting and made me like her even more.",A somewhat disjointed look at the life of Hillary Clinton. Quick read. The writer obviously admires her and occasionally gets side tracked by talking about events during the Clinton presidency...,"I chose this title because of my sincere interest in this being Hillary's time to become President of these United States of America. Marshall has given us a work with a personable and satisfying, journal-like approach. You are certain to enjoy this insightful look at our next president: Hillary Rodham Clinton.","""Hillary"" Review:  I found this book very interesting.

Glad that I didn't purchase it at a big book store.,"As so many things Clinton, opinions veer to the extreme. I like to make up my own mind, so it was a pleasure to read this book that, while it certainly discusses politics, does so without indulging in politics. This is a well-written portrait of a woman who has embodied and defined our times. It sticks to the facts - which, from this reader and follower of all things political, is high praise.",depending on who you are you will either enjoy or dislike this book.  it paints her in a positive light and seems to try to prop her up.,"the book is simple and has some nicely presented stories. however, it ignores facts and presents a lot of propaganda.",This book is definitely divisive and can be seen as a political device for some sort of gain.

B00LADYBSS,"Fabulous short story book, I couldn't put this one down if you like criminal justice type novels you will be mesmerized with this book.","Abysmal. This is a ""legal"" thriller only in the sense that the author appears to have watched television legal comedies to gain an understanding of the legal process. Some artistic license is inevitable -- no one wants to read about weeks of evidence review in response to interrogatories -- but the plot here bears only a slight resemblance to the legal system in the United States. The author doesn't understand what hearsay is, and so the prosecutor ""reads the police statement"" of a missing witness to the jury in a criminal trial. The author doesn't understand prior bad acts evidence rules, and so the prosecutor in her opening statement informs the jury that the accused is a ""bad man"" who has gotten away with many crimes before and never been convicted. This story reads as though a junior-high school student was asked to imagine a criminal trial. Granting one star was necessary in order to write a review, but if I could withdraw even that I would. Complete waste of time.",A basic legal short story with not much intrigue. Useful as a quick read when you have limited time. Foul language probably over used - in my opinion best left out.,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this one..Mr. Graham previous books were great,but this was not up to his standard (in my opinion.)
Also, this ending surprise me..very abrupt and  left the reader hanging.","Good short story on what criminal defense attorneys are supposed to do like it or not ?

Too short even for a short story in my opinion.",Short story but sweet ending.  Writer knows how to get the point where the story ends well.  Good job by writer.,"All are fine thrillers; I liked them all, just a couple better than the others.","Not a single likeable character in the story.  Odd wording some of which may be due to an author who speaks British English as opposed to American English (just a guess.)  Bad editing (e.g., many missing words).  The setting is in the U.S. but one character is a ""member of parliament""?  All in all a very unsatisfying read.  At least it was mercifully short.",Very short. The ending was incomplete because the two criminals could get even with the attorney from behind bars. He is still in danger.,The title doesn't lie. It is really a thriller.,This is a rather short predictable read.  I found it somewhat amusing however and would recommend it if you need to kill a few minutes.,This book was written for a 4th grader. Good plot but grammar school writing. Also many typos. I was very disappointed.,"Can't say too much without revealing the story but as I read along it brought a variety of feelings i.e. Raised my curiosity made me worry, made me appreciate the ""smarts "" of the defending attorney etc. this is a short well written story.",Great read and the price is good too.,This thriller deals with the American legal and justice system. The story is short and the vocabulary used by the author is not precise. ,a novel depicting a criminal justice / courtroom drama. the plot was very basic and did not have much of anything to draw interest or inspire me to read the whole thing.,Two criminals stand trial for a crime in this short legal thriller full of twists and surprises that stands to leave the reader hanging by a thread as they await the verdict.,2 disagreements
B00LAGPOO0,"""There is no way you can compare the taste of a tomato or carrot plucked fresh from the tree to picking up a carrot from the nearby supermarket that had to travel hundreds of miles to reach there.""
Wait...what?? Um the author isn't suggesting that tomatoes and carrots come from trees is she? Hm. I have found numerous spelling and grammatical errors within this book, it is not even a great reference as it contains basic information anyone doing a google search on 'homesteading' could find. Not trying to knock the concept as I am very interested in switching to a more self sufficient lifestyle, I just think that this guide is too broad and too basic to contain anything of true substance. Anyhow at least it was free when I downloaded it.",(downloaded from amazon.co.uk) this book is much needed as we are trying to cut back on costs. we are absolute beginners at the game of homesteading so this book was fantastic for us and full of new and unique tips. i can't say what it would be like for someone more advanced but everything that is in here seems to be written by someone very knowledgable and also a great teacher. we are applying the homesteading tips to our lifestlye. thank you,"Sorry to say, this book was in need of proofreading, and fact checking. You 'live' a lifestyle, not life it, and for the record, carrots are root vegetables, so do not grow on trees. Running into these things early in the book, I quit reading, doubting the validity of any advice given in it.","I haven't read the whole book yet, but I had to laugh when the author suggested picking a carrot off a tree. I'm not sure I want to take advice from someone who thinks carrots grow on trees.","Homesteading is an excellent book with a great concept. I grew up farming and did everything this book describes. I like how the author reminds you this lifestyle works for some that set realistic expectations, but most have good intentions with crazy expectations and don't stick it out.
Though rewarding there is NOTHING easy about this a lifestyle. So I suggest most wordly City Slickers and lazy-butts not bother. However if you are tough, persistent, and don't mind smiling when knee deep in ""s***,"" this could be for you!

Bottom line is Ross has a great guide here with something for everyone to learn. I suggest you read it and let the author know what you think. BRAVO!","Utter rubbish, and the author must have been joking.  Anyone who actually IS interested in homesteading should avoid.","This is the funniest thing I have read in years.  The laughs started at location 137 when she touted the advantages of being able to pluck your own carrots fresh off the tree.  When she explained how supermarkets use a spray on their carrots to artificially ripen them, I was rolling on the floor.

I haven't been able to finish it yet.  I can't see the words for the tears in my eyes.  Keep up the good work but, for Heavens sake, put a disclaimer in the front so everybody will realize it is a work of fiction.","One of the most poorly-written books I have ever encountered. From nonsense like 'picking a fresh carrot off a tree' to meaningless sentences such as 'It is about bringing all the pieces of a concept together so that maximum benefits are availed from it.' What drivel! Did Ms Ross not have an editor that might at least correct some of the spelling errors and bad grammar? Don't waste your time reading this book, unless your command of English is as poor as the author's.","Maybe I was looking for more than this book was offering but it barely offered enough tips to start homesteading.  More detailed, specific examples or instructions on how to get started would have been appreciated.  Several typos and an awkward writing style made this a somewhat difficult read.","I've been working on being
more self sufficient. So I
started my own veggie garden.

with tips, ideas, and strategies,
to help get you started with self
sufficiency. I really like the chapter on

Especially if you are thinking of getting livestock.","I am brand new to this concept. I was looking for supporting information along with step by step guides, since I am clueless in this area. The information was good to give you helpful information. However, I did not get the step by step guide.","Edit, edit, edit. Rainwater is not a ""they"", etc... The lack of editing in this book and some of the words used distract from the ideas in this book. The more I read, the more disgusted I became. You see, I have homesteaded before, and this book doesn't count as a guide for a beginner.

There is a lot of information covered and as a result, too much of it is vague or not carefully explained. It would be better to toss out the fluff and flesh out the rest of it.

What was the point of including a chapter on organic eggs, waxing on about the benefits but NOT giving information on how to properly care for hens? Sorry, one paragraph telling us to let the hens roam free, feed them homemade organic matter, and claiming that organic eggs do not induce the hens to molt, is not acceptable for explaining how to care for hens.","Unfortunately I was not able to get but a few pages into the eBook. Author references a tomato and carrot being plucked from a tree and states that to set up a rural homestead you must be willing to give up even electricity. Although that is an option for those going off the grid,it is not a requirement for a rural homestead.  Numerous grammatical and punctuational errors throughout. Poorly constructed. I am thankful I purchased while it was free!","This book is more about encouragement than information.  It also needed editing.  For example ""a carrot fresh from the tree "" makes no sense (carrots being root vegetables).  Moreover, telling readers things like make sure your plants have enough sun, but not too much sun -- or just enough water, neither too much or too little -- is not helpful unless you also give symptoms of what plants look like when they get too much sun or water, etc. Beginning gardeners or homesteaders would especially need that kind of information. In short, not a good gardening book, not a good chicken raising book, really just a book encouraging people to consider urban homesteading -- but not a ""how to"" book.","the book is nicely written and gives a nice idea about homestanding. however, it's described as a step-by-step guide but instead it gives general information. some of the guides and instructions need to be double-checked since they are not completely correct.","This book might be good for someone looking for an introduction to homesteading, but don't rely on it to give you all the information you need. Also, it seems like someone failed to edit it before it got published.",the book has many grammatical and logical errors which distract from the subject material. it isn't sufficient as an instruction manual; it mostly encourages people to consider homesteading but doesn't contain enough information to do so without another source of information.,
B00M179WOU,"An enjoyable beginning,but I got lost trying to continue to the end.  This story could use some help. When the Bennett's house  burned and both perent died, my interest went down.  Trying to make all the sister's stories in this one book was an over kill.

.","Darcy does not write a letter of explanation to Lizzie and just leaves.  He changes his mind about marrying for love and decides to marry just for an heir.  Georgiana doesn't accept this and she and Col. Fitzwilliam meet up with Lizzie in London to set things right.  A fire at Longbourn brings about multiple changes in the sisters' lives.  Another very enjoyable P&P storyline and worth reading.  However, overlook the spelling and grammatical errors or even omitted words as this can be expected when a computer is used for editing.","My only complaint is that I wanted more. I thought the story could have been longer with much more detail/explanation. I loved the different track with Col. Fitzwilliam! Again, I just wish there had been more... I can't really explain it better than that. I do have one disclaimer/warning. If you have a difficult time overlooking editing/proof reading mistakes, then don't read this one. I have seen too many reviews that were bad based solely on the editing, which completely dismisses what was a wonderful story.","Slow, stiff read.  It was okay but this seems to be a completely different Lizzy","Another great book by Don Miller. This is my third, and I enjoyed it very much.  It had tragedy as well as a happy ending.","I did enjoy this book but did feel that it was missing something, what that something is I cant tell you. Ill be honest I couldn't write a book to save my life so admire all those that can and do. I just felt that maybe it was emotion that was missing, just not sure. The start had me very intrigued and then in the middle things started to pan out but by the end I felt it was rushed. Darcy & Elizabeth did act out of what we would think to be their normal character although I think that might be what was grabbing me, it was unlike what I had already read. I really think you need to try this book for yourself, as I said, I did enjoy it and read it in only a few days.","I did enjoy this book, even if it was a bit sappy. It was just all to perfect for everyone. I know this is fiction , but this went a bit to far. Nothing was ever settled about the fire. That was a loose end. My biggest complaint is ""don't you have spell check""?????? I found more typos in this book than any other book l have read!  After all my complaining, I did enjoy it.","This gets one star for so many reasons. It is at once:
Stilted, emotionless, too many plot lines none of which carry throughout the novel, unedited(""should"" instead of ""shoulder"", ""Mrs. Bingley and his aunt""), conversations that are painful and without any naturalness, full of the retelling of events that the person being spoken to was party too.

This book is the prime example that spell checking software does not substitute for a  good proofreading. And the story could do nothing but improve for want of an editor.","This was a creative attempt at a variation of P&P but I was not impressed. Mr Darcy was only kinda like Mr Darcy (in moments) and Lizzie was not at all Lizzie. It was often contradictory even in the same paragraph and many of the social requirements of that day were disregarded. There were some pretty bad typos and missing words. I can forgive a lot of things but this book fell for short for me. I appreciate the attempt and the imagination but I felt this was P&P in name only, completely lacking the essence, humor and difficulties of the actual characters and story line. 2 stars for the creative attempt only. :(","3 1/2 stars would have given it 4 stars if edited properly. Most editing errors seemed to be careless mistakes that a good proof reading would have caught.
That being said I did enjoy the story. I always like it when Lizzie is portrayed as a strong, intelligent woman. She really shines in this one. Propriety was loosely followed at best. This doesn't overly bother me if it's an entertaining read that holds my attention. I like the way this author takes secondary characters from his previous books and writes them into a completely different plot. I did not find it quite believable that all of the sisters turned out so well and also married well. But..... It is fiction after all and I like happy endings. The ending here was all tied up prettily with a great big bow!","I liked the way she included the sisters, especially Mary, in her retelling of the story.","Poorly written book with extremely random story line and character additions that serve no point.  I've read worse, but still not recommended.","Loved this variation.  Truly enjoyed this Lizzy and Will.  Enjoyed their rocky road to discovery of their love.  Loved the debt of the characters.  Enjoyed the abundance of romance, appreciated the torment and how the characters dealt with them.  I was satisfied by the end of f the book.","I loved this telling very different they characters are true, I would have like to have seen more of Richard Mary and Anne I think those three made very interesting back story in this novel and would have made a great book by themselves.

B00MF8BJQE,"Written during a different era when a persons reputation was extremely important, this female narrative story authentically captures the mores of that generation with a snapshot in time and an engaging plot.

Your reputation is like your virginity; once you lose it  thats it.  Or as one quote worthy person stated, I am grateful I can lose my reputation but once.  These are the themes that are embroidered in an account of a woman when such things could irrevocably change the course of your life.

This is enjoyably reading.",Very good efforts. Well Done. Keep it up.,"I enjoyed the dialogue in this book very much. When the characters were interacting I found it very engaging. Some of the inner thought and background sections seemed to stretch on a bit for me. However, overall I thoroughly enjoyed the novel! Good attempt at a first novel.","Fascinating and powerful account of a story set in the English Country Side, and a woman's story and struggle to take care of younger children. This is a story of courage, faith and reality with a powerful message of redemption.","There was an interesting story in there somewhere, however, the writing was a burden to get through and there were one too many anachronisms for my tastes. I'd read this author again because she can paint a pretty picture with a stroke of her words, but she needs a skilled editor who'd be willing to tell her when to reign it in a bit.","This is not an easy review to write, why? Well its all down to taste. If you like classic Victoriana with a good story then this is for you. If you want your read to be full of depth and soul searching then dive in, but if your preference is for fast moving action then there are passages in this book that will drive you to exasperation. As I said its a matter of choice as to what you like to read.
So, we have a woman wronged who seeks to get her life back together. She has the whole world against her for perceived disgraces relating to her broken marriage, but is given the chance to build her life once more and to fight for what is right. The writing is excellent, indeed it could have been written within the time period it is set in. The use of colloquialisms is knowledgeable and precise in its accuracy. not Downton Abbey so much as Upstairs Downstairs.
As I said, if you like to immerse yourself in classical Victoriana then this is a near perfect read.","I like stories that feature female characters who have won through hard times and extreme adversity, and that certainly describes the lead character, Jane. She's suffered great losses but takes her fate into her own hands and marches on without giving up.

That said, I would prefer less exposition and more dramatization of Jane's life. The plot moves along quite slowly, especially in the early parts of the book when much of Jane's backstory is revealed. The italicized voices in her head left me confused. Where they the voices of others or something her own mind made up?

There are still a large number of editorial issues in the text, enough that I couldn't give the book a higher star rating. I applaud the writer for completing the work so far, but more polishing needs to done. That's best accomplished in a beta reader program or critique group rather than a publication setting. And what's here on the page is definitely worth the effort of polishing.

I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","Set in 19th century Britain, The Governess's setting, characters (especially that of protagonist Jane Adams) and the circumstances surrounding them are reminiscent of literary classic Jane Eyre. Noorilhuda's Jane, upon receiving appointment as a governess, has the challenge of overcoming her meager station in life as well as a past that may affect her future social standing. She is also plagued by The Voice in her own head, which often berates her and reminds her of her past, troubled relationship with her father. Employed by Lady Cavendish, Jane sets out to accomplish this task, along the way thrown in the midst of mystery, more family troubles, and romance. This story will likely appeal to fans of other historical fiction novels, particularly those that enjoy a romantic end.","I was also spammed, but I thought that I would give a read. I did not like this story. I'm  pretty sure that in 1837 yogurt was not common enough to use as a poultice especially on a child's head. I had issues with the maid calling the children ""kids""  and the main male character letting his, married to a different peer of the realm, mistress into his breakfast room in her BATHROBE.",Enjoyable reading experience. A page turner! Transports you instantly to other worlds. Strong characterization and good writing.,"I am generally a fan of historical fiction, but I had a difficult time getting into this book.  Much of the novel consists of internal thoughts and monologues. These long streams of consciousness make it difficult to distinguish when you are in the present and when you are experiencing a flashback. The story in very slow, not uncommon for this genre, however I found much of the beginning uninteresting and had to stop myself from skimming pages. I wanted to give up several times, but I pushed on through and am very glad I did. Once I got past the 35% mark, the story began to pick up and the characters drew me in. The long monologues were still distracting, but my emotional attachment to the characters made these more bearable.

All in all, it was an interesting story with characters you'll come to love. Though slow to start, don't give up on this novel.

I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.","Obviously, the author of The Governess likes literary style of Jane Austen. I personally did not mind, in fact the very plot of the story is well designed and the characters are very well fit into the period of Victorian England. The main character Jane must find a job to survive, because they all rejected after her husband drove out of the house. She goes out of his seat and submits a request to be a governess in the Cavendish family at the other end of England. Lady Cavendish accepts it because she liked its simple and honest approach, although its recommendations less than the other candidates. But soon rumors, prejudices and lies about Jane come to Chateaux.
I personally liked the book, but my only objection is that sometimes the characters too much thinking. In addition, the writer has managed to conjure up every detail of that time. Descriptions are excellent and all in all, the book is very good.
""Copy provided courtesy of the author in exchange for an honest review.""","I found this story absolutely suffocating. Just trying to get past all the psychological minutia was exhausting. After all of the history on almost every character in the book and dragging through all tiring need from the author to take us on the couch, it ended up just like we thought it would as the governess got the rich guy. I would only suggest this story to those who enjoy delving into all things psychological.","I too am here because the author spammed some of my reviews.  I think it's a deplorable marketing strategy, and only serves to fill the Amazon review system with garbage.  I use the Amazon review system frequently because I think it's a very helpful service when considering purchases, and I think this type of behavior needs to be discouraged.  I hate to 1 star something that I haven't purchased, but hopefully it will make the author rethink their marketing strategy.","I received a copy of this in exchange for an honest review.
This was a well-written story about a young woman named Jane.  Jane has a scandalous past, so it appears, and because of that, is finding it difficult to find friends, or employment.  Eventually, she is able to find a job as a governess for the children of a wealthy man.  It reminded me very much of Jane Eyre, and, has many plot points that are extremely similar.  Aside from Jane, there are many other characters introduced into the story, whose situations are described in greater detail than I felt was needed.  But overall, it was a good tale.  It did have mention of sex and sexual situations in it, but nothing extreme.","overall an interesting book is written in a historical/victorian era. the book has good writing, but is somewhat unbelievable at times, which is questionable with things feeling out of place at times.",it is a story about a woman and her family and her life. it talked about her struggles. you saw her develop as a character. it is worth a read.,The pace of the book is slow but it describes very well the life of a woman that tries to regain her life back in the Victorian age,

All I can say is MORE!","I saw this book and was intrigued by the whole teacher/student concept.  Simon Foster is the hot college professor and Lynora is the mousy, naive student.

I liked the book well enough, but I don't like Lynn at all.  She's a very weak female lead. She's either speechless and dumbstruck when she's in Simon's presence or she's smart mouthed and says hateful things without thinking.  She's so naive and whiney.  So annoying.  Simon is Simon.  He seems very sure of himself and what he wants and doesn't have to put up with Lynn and her childish fits.

This installment ends in a bit of a cliffhanger, which I completely understand due to the way Lynn acted.  Because it was free and the next one is only $.99, I'll continue reading.  I'm invested enough to read it and see what happens.  I do understand that there will be at least 3 books from what I've read.","Eye opening taboo relationship born of list. The back and forth on both of their parts showed their passion vs. logic. Very steamy dorm room scene. Ending makes you want to know what happens in the rest of series, she is still his student.",Good story line. Can't wait for next one to release.,"I couldn't put it down ... great story, characters and steamy HOT !!! Cannot wait to read the rest of the collection ...  I give it an 18+ age range ...",Great quick read. Loved the development of the characters.  Can't wait for the other book to come out.,Ice cold fire hot professor his TA definitely has some baggage it was a good read very rushed no suspense in this first book I'm on to the second to read it,I was enjoying the story line albeit stunted but it did not draw me in enough to purchase the next one.  There is room to use some more descriptive scenes but considering the fact that this book seems geared to a very young genre it works.,I could not put this book down. This author totally kept me engaged with the storyline. I can't wait to read the next book.,"I like the storyline but it seems to move quickly and I want it to build up more. On the flip side, I like how I don't have to wait forever to get to the meat of the plot.","This was a different way of thinking about sexual indulgence in writing this book. The characters were alright, the story seemed like the author didn't have to go all out for the storyline.",This book was awesome!!!! I really enjoyed reading it!,Needed more storyline. In depth. Something was missing. Way too short. Characters was not developed fully. Disappointed . it does have potential.,Interesting theory. What will lynn think when she is treated like everyone else? Let the theory begin. She is a woman. This won't end well,"What a fantastic read!!!  I was hooked from the first chapter.  It is steamy hot, crazy daring, and just right down sexy as sin.  I cannot wait for book #2.  Ready for some more Professor Simon and Lynn!!!  Kudos Avery Phillips on a great read!!!!","being a high school girl simon foster a very attractive experienced high school teacher and lynora the sweetened shy of high school where she is not noticed for all her qualities, and lynn is the popular girl who outshines everyone.",the book is good and interesting. this book describes well the gap and understanding between teacher and student relationship.this book also talks about the sexual indulgence.so this book can be read only by people above 18 years of age,"the book as a pleasant storyline, it's a fascinating read but somehow short. however it lacks details.",
